69 Approach to the Patient 
with Cancer
Dan L. Longo

The  application  of  current  treatment  techniques  (surgery,  radiation 
therapy,  chemotherapy,  and  biologic  therapy)  results  in  the  cure  of 
nearly  two  of  three  patients  diagnosed  with  cancer.  Nevertheless, 
patients  experience  the  diagnosis  of  cancer  as  one  of  the  most  trau-
matic  and  revolutionary  events  that  has  ever  happened  to  them. 
Independent  of  prognosis,  the  diagnosis  brings  with  it  a  change  in  a 
person’s self-image and in his or her role in the home and workplace. 
The prognosis of a person who has just been found to have pancreatic 
cancer is the same as the prognosis of the person with aortic stenosis 
who develops the first symptoms of congestive heart failure (median 
survival,  ~8  months).  However,  the  patient  with  heart  disease  may 
remain  functional  and  maintain  a  self-image  as  a  fully  intact  person 
with just a malfunctioning part, a diseased organ (“a bum ticker”). By 
contrast,  the  patient  with  pancreatic  cancer  has  a  completely  altered 
self-image and is viewed differently by family and anyone who knows 
the diagnosis. He or she is being attacked and invaded by a disease that 
could be anywhere in the body. Every ache or pain takes on desperate

significance.  Cancer  is  an  exception  to  the  coordinated  interaction 
among cells and organs. In general, the cells of a multicellular organism 
are  programmed  for  collaboration.  Many  diseases  occur  because  the 
specialized cells fail to perform their assigned task. Cancer takes this 
malfunction one step further. Not only is there a failure of the cancer 
cell  to  maintain  its  specialized  function,  but  it  also  strikes  out  on  its 
own; the cancer cell competes to survive using natural mutability and 
natural selection to seek advantage over normal cells in a recapitulation 
of evolution. One consequence of the traitorous behavior of cancer cells 
is that the patient feels betrayed by his or her body. The cancer patient 
feels that he or she, and not just a body part, is diseased.

THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM
No nationwide cancer registry exists; therefore, the incidence of cancer 
is estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epidemiology,  and  End  Results  (SEER)  database,  which  tabulates 
cancer incidence and death figures from 13 sites, accounting for about 
10%  of  the  U.S.  population,  and  from  population  data  from  the  U.S. 
Census  Bureau.  In  2021,  1.898  million  new  cases  of  invasive  cancer 
(970,250 men and 927,910 women) were diagnosed, and 608,570 per-
sons (319,420 men and 289,150 women) died from cancer. The percent 
distribution of new cancer cases and cancer deaths by site for men and 
women is shown in Table 69-1. Cancer incidence has been declining 
by about 2% each year since 1992. Cancer is the cause of one in four 
deaths in the United States.

The most significant risk factor for cancer overall is age; two-thirds 
of all cases were in those aged >65 years. Cancer incidence increases as 
the third, fourth, or fifth power of age in different sites. For the interval

FIGURE 69-1  Trends in cancer incidence, 1975–2017. (From Cancer Statistics 2021, Rl Seigel et al, © 2021 CA Cancer J Clin. Reproduced with permission of John Wiley & 
Sons Ltd.)

between birth and age 49 years, 1 in 29 men and 1 in 19 women will 
develop  cancer;  for  the  interval  between  ages  50  and  59  years,  1  in  
15  men  and  1  in  17  women  will  develop  cancer;  for  the  interval 
between  ages  60  and  69  years,  1  in  6  men  and  1  in  10  women  will 
develop cancer; and for people aged ≥70, 1 in 3 men and 1 in 4 women 
will develop cancer. Overall, men have a 40.5% risk of developing can-
cer at some time during their lives; women have a 38.9% lifetime risk.
Cancer  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  behind  heart  disease. 
Deaths from heart disease have declined 45% in the United States since 
1950  and  continue  to  decline.  Cancer  has  overtaken  heart  disease  as 
the number one cause of death in persons aged <85 years. Incidence 
trends  over  time  are  shown  in  Fig.  69-1.  After  a  70-year  period  of 
increase,  cancer  deaths  began  to  decline  in  1990–1991  (Fig.  69-2). 
Between 1990 and 2010, cancer deaths decreased by 21% among men 
and 12.3% among women. The incidence has been steady since 2013. 
The magnitude of the decline is illustrated in Fig. 69-3. The five leading 
causes of cancer deaths are shown for various populations in Table 69-2. 
The 5-year survival for white patients was 39% in 1960–1963 and 68% 
in  2010–2016.  Cancers  are  more  often  deadly  in  blacks;  the  5-year 
survival was 63% for the 2010–2016 interval; however, the racial dif-
ferences are narrowing over time. Incidence and mortality vary among 
racial and ethnic groups (Table 69-3). The basis for these differences 
is unclear.

Advances  in  cancer  prevention,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  since  the 
early 1990s have averted millions of cancer deaths based on projections 
from the slopes of the mortality curves leading up to the 1990s (Fig. 69-4).
 ■ CANCER AROUND THE WORLD
In  2018,  17  million  new  cancer  cases  and  9.5  million  cancer  deaths 
were  estimated  worldwide,  according  to  estimates  of  GLOBOCAN 
2018, developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC). Rates are increasing worldwide. When broken down by region 
of the world, ~45% of cases were in Asia (which has 59.5% of the world’s 
population), 26% in Europe (9.8% of the world’s population), 14.5% in 
North America, 7.1% in Central/South America (the Americas, North 
and South, account for 13.3% of the world’s population), 6% in Africa 
(16.9%  of  the  world’s  population),  and  1%  in  Australia/New  Zealand 

(0.5% of the world’s population) (Fig. 69-5). Lung cancer is the most 
common cancer and the most common cause of cancer death in the 
world.  Its  incidence  is  highly  variable,  affecting  only  2  per  100,000 
African women but as many as 61 per 100,000 North American men. 
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide; however, 
it  ranks  fourth  as  a  cause  of  death  behind  lung,  stomach,  and  liver 
cancer. Among the eight most common forms of cancer, lung (2-fold), 
breast (3-fold), prostate (2.5-fold), and colorectal (3-fold) cancers are 
more  common  in  more  developed  countries  than  in  less  developed 
countries. By contrast, liver (2-fold), cervical (2-fold), and esophageal 
(2- to 3-fold) cancers are more common in less developed countries. 
Stomach  cancer  incidence  is  similar  in  more  and  less  developed 
countries but is much more common in Asia than North America or 
Africa. The most common cancers in Africa are cervical, breast, and 
liver  cancers.  It  has  been  estimated  that  nine  modifiable  risk  factors 
are responsible for more than one-third of cancers worldwide. These 
include  smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  obesity,  physical  inactivity, 
low fruit and vegetable consumption, unsafe sex, air pollution, indoor 
smoke from household fuels, and contaminated injections.

PATIENT MANAGEMENT
Important information is obtained from every portion of the routine 
history  and  physical  examination.  The  duration  of  symptoms  may 
reveal the chronicity of disease. The past medical history may alert the 
physician  to  the  presence  of  underlying  diseases  that  may  affect  the 
choice  of  therapy  or  the  side  effects  of  treatment.  The  social  history 
may  reveal  occupational  exposure  to  carcinogens  or  habits,  such  as 
smoking  or  alcohol  consumption,  that  may  influence  the  course  of 
disease  and  its  treatment.  The  family  history  may  suggest  an  under-
lying  familial  cancer  predisposition  and  point  out  the  need  to  begin 
surveillance or other preventive therapy for unaffected siblings of the 
patient. The review of systems may suggest early symptoms of meta-
static disease or a paraneoplastic syndrome.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  diagnosis  of  cancer  relies  most  heavily  on  invasive  tissue  biopsy 
and  should  never  be  made  without  obtaining  tissue;  no  noninvasive

diagnostic test is sufficient to define a disease process such as cancer. 
Although  in  rare  clinical  settings  (e.g.,  thyroid  nodules),  fine-needle 
aspiration is an acceptable diagnostic procedure, the diagnosis gener-
ally depends on obtaining adequate tissue to permit careful evaluation 
of  the  histology  of  the  tumor,  its  grade,  and  its  invasiveness  and  to 
yield further molecular diagnostic information, such as the expression 
of cell-surface markers or intracellular proteins that typify a particu-
lar cancer, or the presence of a molecular marker, such as the t(8;14) 
translocation  of  Burkitt’s  lymphoma.  Increasing  evidence  links  the 
expression of certain genes with the prognosis and response to therapy 
(Chaps. 71 and 72).

Occasionally, a patient will present with a metastatic disease process 
that is defined as cancer on biopsy but has no apparent primary site of 
disease. Efforts should be made to define the primary site based on age, 
sex, sites of involvement, histology and tumor markers, and personal 
and family history. Particular attention should be focused on ruling out 
the most treatable causes (Chap. 92).

Once  the  diagnosis  of  cancer  is  made,  the  management  of  the 
patient is best undertaken as a multidisciplinary collaboration among 
the primary care physician, medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, 
radiation  oncologists,  oncology  nurse  specialists,  pharmacists,  social 
workers,  rehabilitation  medicine  specialists,  and  a  number  of  other 
consulting professionals working closely with each other and with the 
patient and family.
 ■ DEFINING THE EXTENT OF DISEASE AND  
THE PROGNOSIS
The first priority in patient management after the diagnosis of cancer 
is established and shared with the patient is to determine the extent of 
disease. The curability of a tumor usually is inversely proportional to 
the tumor burden. Ideally, the tumor will be diagnosed before symp-
toms develop or as a consequence of screening efforts (Chap. 70). A 
very  high  proportion  of  such  patients  can  be  cured.  However,  most 
patients  with  cancer  present  with  symptoms  related  to  the  cancer, 
caused either by mass effects of the tumor or by alterations associated 
with the production of cytokines or hormones by the tumor.

For most cancers, the extent of disease is evaluated by a variety of 
noninvasive  and  invasive  diagnostic  tests  and  procedures.  This  pro-
cess is called staging. There are two types. Clinical staging is based on 
physical  examination,  radiographs,  isotopic  scans,  computed  tomog-
raphy  (CT)  scans,  and  other  imaging  procedures;  pathologic  staging 
takes into account information obtained during a surgical procedure, 
which  might  include  intraoperative  palpation,  resection  of  regional 
lymph nodes and/or tissue adjacent to the tumor, and inspection and 
biopsy  of  organs  commonly  involved  in  disease  spread.  Pathologic 
staging includes histologic examination of all tissues removed during 
the  surgical  procedure.  Surgical  procedures  performed  may  include 
a  simple  lymph  node  biopsy  or  more  extensive  procedures  such  as 
thoracotomy,  mediastinoscopy,  or  laparotomy.  Surgical  staging  may 
occur in a separate procedure or may be done at the time of definitive 
surgical resection of the primary tumor. A subset of pathologic staging 
is the examination of tissue obtained at initial surgery that occurs after  
the  delivery  of  some  treatment,  which  is  called  neoadjuvant  therapy. 
Stage  of  disease  determined  after  neoadjuvant  therapy  is  designated 
with the prefix y.

Knowledge of the predilection of particular tumors for spreading to 

adjacent or distant organs helps direct the staging evaluation.

Information  obtained  from  staging  is  used  to  define  the  extent  of 
disease as localized, as exhibiting spread outside of the organ of origin 
to regional but not distant sites, or as metastatic to distant sites. The 
most  widely  used  system  of  staging  is  the  tumor,  node,  metastasis 
(TNM) system codified by the International Union Against Cancer and 
the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The TNM classification is 
an anatomically based system that categorizes the tumor on the basis 
of the size of the primary tumor lesion (T1–4, where a higher number 
indicates  a  tumor  of  larger  size),  the  presence  of  nodal  involvement 

(usually  N0  and  N1  for  the  absence  and  presence,  respectively,  of 
involved  nodes,  although  some  tumors  have  more  elaborate  systems 
of nodal grading), and the presence of metastatic disease (M0 and M1 
for the absence and presence, respectively, of metastases). The various 
permutations  of  T,  N,  and  M  scores  (sometimes  including  tumor 
histologic grade [G]) are then broken into stages, usually designated 
by  the  roman  numerals  I  through  IV.  Tumor  burden  increases  and 
curability  decreases  with  increasing  stage.  Other  anatomic  staging 
systems  are  used  for  some  tumors,  e.g.,  the  Dukes  classification  for

colorectal cancers, the International Federation of Gynecologists and 
Obstetricians classification for gynecologic cancers, and the Ann Arbor 
classification for Hodgkin’s disease.

Certain  tumors  cannot  be  grouped  on  the  basis  of  anatomic  con-
siderations.  For  example,  hematopoietic  tumors  such  as  leukemia, 
myeloma, and lymphoma are often disseminated at presentation and 
do  not  spread  like  solid  tumors.  For  these  tumors,  other  prognostic 
factors have been identified (Chaps. 104–111).

In addition to tumor burden, a second major determinant of treat-
ment outcome is the physiologic reserve of the patient. Patients who 
are bedridden before developing cancer are likely to fare worse, stage 
for stage, than fully active patients. Physiologic reserve is a determinant 
of how a patient is likely to cope with the physiologic stresses imposed 
by the cancer and its treatment. This factor is difficult to assess directly. 
Instead,  surrogate  markers  for  physiologic  reserve  are  used,  such  as 
the  patient’s  age  or  Karnofsky  performance  status  (Table  69-4)  or 
Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  
(Table 69-5). Older patients and those with a Karnofsky performance 
status  <70  or  ECOG  performance  status  ≥3  have  a  poor  prognosis 
unless the poor performance is a reversible consequence of the tumor.
Increasingly, biologic features of the tumor are being related to prog-
nosis. The expression of particular oncogenes, drug-resistance genes, 
apoptosis-related  genes,  and  genes  involved  in  metastasis  is  being 
found  to  influence  response  to  therapy  and  prognosis.  The  presence 
of selected cytogenetic abnormalities may influence survival. Tumors 
with higher growth fractions, as assessed by expression of proliferation- 
related markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, behave more 
aggressively  than  tumors  with  lower  growth  fractions.  Information 
obtained  from  studying  the  tumor  itself  will  increasingly  be  used  to 
influence treatment decisions. Host genes involved in drug metabolism 
can influence the safety and efficacy of particular treatments.

Enormous  heterogeneity  has  been  noted  by  studying  tumors;  we 
have  learned  that  morphology  is  not  capable  of  discerning  certain 
distinct subsets of patients whose tumors have different sets of abnor-
malities. Tumors that look the same by light microscopy can be very 
different. Similarly, tumors that look quite different from one another 
histologically  can  share  genetic  lesions  that  predict  responses  to 

treatments. Furthermore, tumor cells vary enormously within a single 
patient even though the cells share a common origin.
 ■ MAKING A TREATMENT PLAN
From  information  on  the  extent  of  disease  and  the  prognosis  and  in 
conjunction  with  the  patient’s  wishes,  it  is  determined  whether  the 
treatment  approach  should  be  curative  or  palliative  in  intent.  Coop-
eration among the various professionals involved in cancer treatment 
is of the utmost importance in treatment planning. For some cancers, 
chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy delivered before 
the use of definitive surgical treatment (so-called neoadjuvant therapy) 
may improve the outcome, as seems to be the case for locally advanced 
breast cancer and head and neck cancers. In certain settings in which 
combined-modality therapy is intended, coordination among the med-
ical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon is crucial to achieving 
optimal  results.  Sometimes  the  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy 
need to be delivered sequentially, and other times concurrently. Surgi-
cal procedures may precede or follow other treatment approaches. It is 
best for the treatment plan either to follow a standard protocol precisely 
or  else  to  be  part  of  an  ongoing  clinical  research  protocol  evaluating 
new treatments. Ad hoc modifications of standard protocols are likely 
to compromise treatment results.

The choice of treatment approaches was formerly dominated by the 
local culture in both the university and the practice settings. However, it 
is now possible to gain access electronically to standard treatment pro-
tocols and to every approved clinical research study in North America 
through a personal computer interface with the Internet.1

a facsimile machine using CancerFax by dialing 301-402-5874. Patient infor-
mation is also provided by the National Cancer Institute in at least three for-

The skilled physician also has much to offer the patient for whom 
curative therapy is no longer an option. Often a combination of guilt 
and frustration over the inability to cure the patient and the pressure of 
a busy schedule greatly limit the time a physician spends with a patient 
who  is  receiving  only  palliative  care.  Resist  these  forces.  In  addition

to the medicines administered to alleviate symptoms (see below), it is 
important  to  remember  the  comfort  that  is  provided  by  holding  the 
patient’s  hand,  continuing  regular  examinations,  and  taking  time  to 
talk.

 ■ MANAGEMENT OF DISEASE AND TREATMENT 
COMPLICATIONS
Because  cancer  therapies  are  toxic  (Chap.  73),  patient  management 
involves addressing complications of both the disease and its treatment 
as well as the complex psychosocial problems associated with cancer. 
In the short term during a course of curative therapy, the patient’s func-
tional status may decline. Treatment-induced toxicity is less acceptable 
if  the  goal  of  therapy  is  palliation.  The  most  common  side  effects  of 
treatment  are  nausea  and  vomiting  (see  below),  febrile  neutropenia 
(Chap. 74), and myelosuppression (Chap. 73). Tools are now available 
to minimize the acute toxicity of cancer treatment.

New symptoms developing in the course of cancer treatment should 
always be assumed to be reversible until proven otherwise. The fatal-
istic attribution of anorexia, weight loss, and jaundice to recurrent or 
progressive  tumor  could  result  in  a  patient  dying  from  a  reversible 
intercurrent cholecystitis. Intestinal obstruction may be due to revers-
ible  adhesions  rather  than  progressive  tumor.  Systemic  infections, 
sometimes  with  unusual  pathogens,  may  be  a  consequence  of  the 
immunosuppression associated with cancer therapy. Some drugs used 
to treat cancer or its complications (e.g., nausea) may produce central 
nervous  system  symptoms  that  look  like  metastatic  disease  or  may 
mimic paraneoplastic syndromes such as the syndrome of inappropri-
ate antidiuretic hormone. A definitive diagnosis should be pursued and 
may even require a repeat biopsy.

A  critical  component  of  cancer  management  is  assessing  the 
response  to  treatment.  In  addition  to  a  careful  physical  examination 
in which all sites of disease are physically measured and recorded in 
a  flow  chart  by  date,  response  assessment  usually  requires  periodic 
repeating of imaging tests that were abnormal at the time of staging. 
If  imaging  tests  have  become  normal,  repeat  biopsy  of  previously 
involved tissue is performed to document complete response by patho-
logic criteria. Biopsies are not usually required if there is macroscopic 
residual disease. A complete response is defined as disappearance of all 
evidence  of  disease,  and  a  partial  response  as  >50%  reduction  in  the 
sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable 
lesions. The determination of partial response may also be based on a 
30% decrease in the sums of the longest diameters of lesions (Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]). Progressive disease is 
defined as the appearance of any new lesion or an increase of >25% in 
the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measur-
able lesions (or an increase of 20% in the sums of the longest diameters 
by  RECIST).  Tumor  shrinkage  or  growth  that  does  not  meet  any  of 
these  criteria  is  considered  stable  disease.  Some  sites  of  involvement 
(e.g., bone) or patterns of involvement (e.g., lymphangitic lung or dif-
fuse pulmonary infiltrates) are considered unmeasurable. No response 
is  complete  without  biopsy  documentation  of  their  resolution,  but 
partial responses may exclude their assessment unless clear objective 
progression has occurred.

For  some  hematologic  neoplasms,  flow  cytometric  and  genetic 
assays may determine the presence of residual tumor cells that escape 
microscopic detection. In general, these techniques can reliably detect 
as few as 1 tumor cell among 10,000 cells. If such tests do not detect 
tumor cells, the patient is said to have minimal residual disease neg-
ativity,  a  finding  generally  associated  with  more  durable  remissions. 
Accumulating data are defining interventions in patients with minimal 
residual  disease  positivity  that  can  extend  remission  duration  and 
survival.

Tumor  markers  may  be  useful  in  patient  management  in  certain 
tumors. Response to therapy may be difficult to gauge with certainty. 
However,  some  tumors  produce  or  elicit  the  production  of  markers 
that can be measured in the serum or urine, and in a particular patient, 
rising  and  falling  levels  of  the  marker  are  usually  associated  with 
increasing  or  decreasing  tumor  burden,  respectively.  Some  clinically 
useful tumor markers are shown in Table 69-6. Tumor markers are not

in themselves specific enough to permit a diagnosis of malignancy to 
be made, but once a malignancy has been diagnosed and shown to be 
associated with elevated levels of a tumor marker, the marker can be 
used to assess response to treatment.

The recognition and treatment of depression are important compo-
nents of management. The incidence of depression in cancer patients 
is  ~25%  overall  and  may  be  greater  in  patients  with  greater  debility. 
This diagnosis is likely in a patient with a depressed mood (dysphoria) 
and/or a loss of interest in pleasure (anhedonia) for at least 2 weeks. In 
addition, three or more of the following symptoms are usually present: 
appetite change, sleep problems, psychomotor retardation or agitation, 
fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, inability to concentrate, and 
suicidal ideation. Patients with these symptoms should receive therapy. 
Medical therapy with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as fluoxetine 
(10–20 mg/d), sertraline (50–150 mg/d), or paroxetine (10–20 mg/d) 
or  a  tricyclic  antidepressant  such  as  amitriptyline  (50–100  mg/d)  or 
desipramine  (75–150  mg/d)  should  be  tried,  allowing  4–6  weeks  for 
response. Effective therapy should be continued at least 6 months after 
resolution  of  symptoms.  If  therapy  is  unsuccessful,  other  classes  of 
antidepressants may be used. In addition to medication, psychosocial 
interventions such as support groups, psychotherapy, and guided imag-
ery may be of benefit.

Many  patients  opt  for  unproven  or  unsound  approaches  to  treat-
ment  when  it  appears  that  conventional  medicine  is  unlikely  to  be 
curative. Those seeking such alternatives are often well educated and

may be  early  in the course of  their disease.  Unsound  approaches  are 
usually hawked on the basis of unsubstantiated anecdotes and not only 
cannot help the patient but may be harmful. Physicians should strive 
to keep communications open and nonjudgmental, so that patients are 
more likely to discuss with the physician what they are actually doing. 
The  appearance  of  unexpected  toxicity  may  be  an  indication  that  a 
supplemental therapy is being taken.2

LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP/LATE 
COMPLICATIONS
At  the  completion  of  treatment,  sites  originally  involved  with  tumor 
are reassessed, usually by radiography or imaging techniques, and any 
persistent  abnormality  is  biopsied.  If  disease  persists,  the  multidis-
ciplinary  team  discusses  a  new  salvage  treatment  plan.  If  the  patient 
has  been  rendered  disease-free  by  the  original  treatment,  the  patient 
is  followed  regularly  for  disease  recurrence.  The  optimal  guidelines 
for follow-up care are not known. For many years, a routine practice 
has  been  to  follow  the  patient  monthly  for  6–12  months,  then  every 
other month for a year, every 3 months for a year, every 4 months for 
a year, every 6 months for a year, and then annually. At each visit, a 
battery of laboratory and radiographic and imaging tests was obtained 
on the assumption that it is best to detect recurrent disease before it 
becomes  symptomatic.  However,  where  follow-up  procedures  have 
been examined, this assumption has been found to be untrue. Studies 
of breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, and lymphoma 
have  all  failed  to  support  the  notion  that  asymptomatic  relapses  are 
more readily cured by salvage therapy than symptomatic relapses. In 
view of the enormous cost of a full battery of diagnostic tests and their 
manifest lack of impact on survival, new guidelines are emerging for 
less  frequent  follow-up  visits,  during  which  the  history  and  physical 
examination are the major investigations performed.

As time passes, the likelihood of recurrence of the primary cancer 
diminishes.  For  many  types  of  cancer,  survival  for  5  years  without 
recurrence is tantamount to cure. However, important medical prob-
lems  can  occur  in  patients  treated  for  cancer  and  must  be  examined 
(Chap. 95). Some problems emerge as a consequence of the disease and 
some  as  a  consequence  of  the  treatment.  An  understanding  of  these 
disease-  and  treatment-related  problems  may  help  in  their  detection 
and management.

Despite  these  concerns,  most  patients  who  are  cured  of  cancer 

return to normal lives.

 ■ SUPPORTIVE CARE
In  many  ways,  the  success  of  cancer  therapy  depends  on  the  success 
of the supportive care. Failure to control the symptoms of cancer and 
its treatment may lead patients to abandon curative therapy. Of equal 
importance, supportive care is a major determinant of quality of life. 
Even when life cannot be prolonged, the physician must strive to pre-
serve its quality. Quality-of-life measurements have become common 
endpoints of clinical research studies. Furthermore, palliative care has 
been  shown  to  be  cost-effective  when  approached  in  an  organized 
fashion. A credo for oncology could be to cure sometimes, to extend 
life often, and to comfort always.

Pain  Pain  occurs  with  variable  frequency  in  the  cancer  patient: 
25–50%  of  patients  present  with  pain  at  diagnosis,  33%  have  pain 
associated with treatment, and 75% have pain with progressive disease. 
The pain may have several causes. In ~70% of cases, pain is caused by 
the tumor itself—by invasion of bone, nerves, blood vessels, or mucous 
membranes  or  obstruction  of  a  hollow  viscus  or  duct.  In  ~20%  of 
cases,  pain  is  related  to  a  surgical  or  invasive  medical  procedure,  to 
radiation injury (mucositis, enteritis, or plexus, or spinal cord injury), 
or to chemotherapy injury (mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, phlebitis, 

steroid-induced aseptic necrosis of the femoral head). In 10% of cases, 
pain is unrelated to cancer or its treatment.

Assessment  of  pain  requires  the  methodical  investigation  of  the 
history of the pain, its location, character, temporal features, provoca-
tive and palliative factors, and intensity (Chaps. 12 and 13); a review 
of the oncologic history and past medical history as well as personal 
and social history; and a thorough physical examination. The patient 
should be given a 10-division visual analogue scale on which to indi-
cate the severity of the pain. The clinical condition is often dynamic, 
making  it  necessary  to  reassess  the  patient  frequently.  Pain  therapy 
should not be withheld while the cause of pain is being sought.

A variety of tools are available with which to address cancer pain. 
About 85% of patients will have pain relief from pharmacologic inter-
vention. However, other modalities, including antitumor therapy (such 
as surgical relief of obstruction, radiation therapy, and strontium-89 or 
samarium-153 treatment for bone pain), neurostimulatory techniques, 
regional  analgesia,  or  neuroablative  procedures,  are  effective  in  an 
additional 12% or so. Thus, very few patients will have inadequate pain 
relief if appropriate measures are taken. A specific approach to pain 
relief is detailed in Chap. 12.

Nausea  Emesis  in  the  cancer  patient  is  usually  caused  by  chemo-
therapy (Chap. 73). Its severity can be predicted from the drugs used 
to treat the cancer. Three forms of emesis are recognized on the basis 
of  their  timing  with  regard  to  the  noxious  insult.  Acute  emesis,  the 
most common variety, occurs within 24 h of treatment. Delayed emesis 
occurs 1–7 days after treatment; it is rare, but, when present, usually 
follows  cisplatin  administration.  Anticipatory  emesis  occurs  before 
administration of chemotherapy and represents a conditioned response 
to visual and olfactory stimuli previously associated with chemother-
apy delivery.

Acute  emesis  is  the  best  understood  form.  Stimuli  that  activate 
signals in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla, the cerebral 
cortex, and peripherally in the intestinal tract lead to stimulation of the 
vomiting center in the medulla, the motor center responsible for coordi-
nating the secretory and muscle contraction activity that leads to emesis. 
Diverse receptor types participate in the process, including dopamine, 
serotonin, histamine, opioid, and acetylcholine receptors. The serotonin 
receptor  antagonists  ondansetron  and  granisetron  are  effective  drugs 
against highly emetogenic agents, as are neurokinin receptor antagonists 
such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant (see Chap. 73).

As  with  the  analgesia  ladder,  emesis  therapy  should  be  tailored 
to  the  situation.  For  mildly  and  moderately  emetogenic  agents,  pro-
chlorperazine, 5–10 mg PO or 25 mg PR, is effective. Its efficacy may 
be  enhanced  by  administering  the  drug  before  the  chemotherapy  is 
delivered.  Dexamethasone,  10–20  mg  IV,  is  also  effective  and  may 
enhance the efficacy of prochlorperazine. For highly emetogenic agents 
such  as  cisplatin,  mechlorethamine,  dacarbazine,  and  streptozocin, 
combinations  of  agents  work  best  and  administration  should  begin  
6–24  h  before  treatment.  Ondansetron,  8  mg  PO  every  6  h  the  day 
before  therapy  and  IV  on  the  day  of  therapy,  plus  dexamethasone,  
20  mg  IV  before  treatment,  is  an  effective  regimen.  Addition  of  oral 
aprepitant  (a  substance  P/neurokinin  1  receptor  antagonist)  to  this 
regimen (125 mg on day 1, 80 mg on days 2 and 3) further decreases 
the risk of both acute and delayed vomiting. Like pain, emesis is easier 
to prevent than to alleviate.

Delayed  emesis  may  be  related  to  bowel  inflammation  from  the 
therapy and can be controlled with oral dexamethasone and oral meto-
clopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist that also blocks serotonin 
receptors at high dosages. The best strategy for preventing anticipatory 
emesis is to control emesis in the early cycles of therapy to prevent the 
conditioning  from  taking  place.  If  this  is  unsuccessful,  prophylactic 
antiemetics the day before treatment may help. Experimental studies 
are evaluating behavior modification.

Effusions  Fluid may accumulate abnormally in the pleural cavity, 
pericardium, or peritoneum. Asymptomatic malignant effusions may 
not  require  treatment.  Symptomatic  effusions  occurring  in  tumors 
responsive to systemic therapy usually do not require local treatment

but respond to the treatment for the underlying tumor. Symptomatic 
effusions occurring in tumors unresponsive to systemic therapy may 
require  local  treatment  in  patients  with  a  life  expectancy  of  at  least  
6 months.

Pleural effusions due to tumors may or may not contain malignant 
cells. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphomas account for ~75% of 
malignant pleural effusions. Their exudative nature is usually gauged 
by  an  effusion/serum  protein  ratio  of  ≥0.5  or  an  effusion/serum  lac-
tate dehydrogenase ratio of ≥0.6. When the condition is symptomatic, 
thoracentesis  is  usually  performed  first.  In  most  cases,  symptomatic 
improvement occurs for <1 month. Chest tube drainage is required if 
symptoms recur within 2 weeks. Fluid is aspirated until the flow rate is 
<100 mL in 24 h. Then either 60 units of bleomycin or 1 g of doxycy-
cline is infused into the chest tube in 50 mL of 5% dextrose in water; the 
tube is clamped; the patient is rotated on four sides, spending 15 min in 
each position; and, after 1–2 h, the tube is again attached to suction for 
another 24 h. The tube is then disconnected from suction and allowed 
to drain by gravity. If <100 mL drains over the next 24 h, the chest tube 
is pulled, and a radiograph is taken 24 h later. If the chest tube continues 
to drain fluid at an unacceptably high rate, sclerosis can be repeated. 
Bleomycin  may  be  somewhat  more  effective  than  doxycycline  but  is 
very expensive. Doxycycline is usually the drug of first choice. If neither 
doxycycline nor bleomycin is effective, talc can be used.

Symptomatic  pericardial  effusions  are  usually  treated  by  creating 
a pericardial window or by stripping the pericardium. If the patient’s 
condition  does  not  permit  a  surgical  procedure,  sclerosis  can  be 
attempted with doxycycline and/or bleomycin.

Malignant  ascites  is  usually  treated  with  repeated  paracentesis  of 
small volumes of fluid. If the underlying malignancy is unresponsive 
to systemic therapy, peritoneovenous shunts may be inserted. Despite 
the fear of disseminating tumor cells into the circulation, widespread 
metastases are an unusual complication. The major complications are 
occlusion, leakage, and fluid overload. Patients with severe liver disease 
may develop disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Nutrition  Cancer and its treatment may lead to a decrease in nutri-
ent intake of sufficient magnitude to cause weight loss and alteration 
of intermediary metabolism. The prevalence of this problem is difficult 
to estimate because of variations in the definition of cancer cachexia, 
but  most  patients  with  advanced  cancer  experience  weight  loss  and 
decreased  appetite.  A  variety  of  both  tumor-derived  factors  (e.g., 
bombesin,  adrenocorticotropic  hormone)  and  host-derived  factors 
(e.g.,  tumor  necrosis  factor,  interleukins  1  and  6,  growth  hormone) 
contribute to the altered metabolism, and a vicious cycle is established 
in which protein catabolism, glucose intolerance, and lipolysis cannot 
be reversed by the provision of calories.

It remains controversial how to assess nutritional status and when 
and  how  to  intervene.  Efforts  to  make  the  assessment  objective  have 
included the use of a prognostic nutritional index based on albumin 
levels,  triceps  skinfold  thickness,  transferrin  levels,  and  delayed-type 
hypersensitivity skin testing. However, a simpler approach has been to 
define the threshold for nutritional intervention as <10% unexplained 
body weight loss, serum transferrin level <1500 mg/L (150 mg/dL), and 
serum albumin <34 g/L (3.4 g/dL).

The decision is important, because it appears that cancer therapy is 
substantially more toxic and less effective in the face of malnutrition. 
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether nutritional intervention can 
alter the natural history. Unless some pathology is affecting the absorp-
tive  function  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  enteral  nutrition  provided 
orally or by tube feeding is preferred over parenteral supplementation. 
However, the risks associated with the tube may outweigh the benefits. 
Megestrol  acetate,  a  progestational  agent,  has  been  advocated  as  a 
pharmacologic intervention to improve nutritional status. Research in 
this  area  may  provide  more  tools  in  the  future  as  cytokine-mediated 
mechanisms are further elucidated.

Psychosocial  Support  The  psychosocial  needs  of  patients  vary 
with  their  situation.  Patients  undergoing  treatment  experience  fear, 
anxiety,  and  depression.  Self-image  is  often  seriously  compromised 

by deforming surgery and loss of hair. Women who receive cosmetic 
advice that enables them to look better also feel better. Loss of control 
over how one spends time can contribute to the sense of vulnerabil-
ity.  Juggling  the  demands  of  work  and  family  with  the  demands  of 
treatment may create enormous stresses. Sexual dysfunction is highly 
prevalent and needs to be discussed openly with the patient. An empa-
thetic health care team is sensitive to the individual patient’s needs and 
permits negotiation where such flexibility will not adversely affect the 
course of treatment.

Cancer  survivors  have  other  sets  of  difficulties.  Patients  may  have 
fears associated with the termination of a treatment they associate with 
their  continued  survival.  Adjustments  are  required  to  physical  losses 
and handicaps, real and perceived. Patients may be preoccupied with 
minor physical problems. They perceive a decline in their job mobility 
and view themselves as less desirable workers. They may be victims of 
job  and/or  insurance  discrimination.  Patients  may  experience  diffi-
culty reentering their normal past life. They may feel guilty for having 
survived  and  may  carry  a  sense  of  vulnerability  to  colds  and  other 
illnesses.  Perhaps  the  most  pervasive  and  threatening  concern  is  the 
ever-present fear of relapse (the Damocles syndrome).

Patients in whom therapy has been unsuccessful have other prob-

lems related to the end of life.

Death and Dying  The most common causes of death in patients 
with  cancer  are  infection  (leading  to  circulatory  failure),  respiratory 
failure, hepatic failure, and renal failure. Intestinal blockage may lead 
to inanition and starvation. Central nervous system disease may lead 
to seizures, coma, and central hypoventilation. About 70% of patients 
develop  dyspnea  preterminally.  However,  many  months  usually  pass 
between the diagnosis of cancer and the occurrence of these compli-
cations, and during this period, the patient is severely affected by the 
possibility of death. The path of unsuccessful cancer treatment usually 
occurs  in  three  phases.  First,  there  is  optimism  at  the  hope  of  cure; 
when the tumor recurs, there is the acknowledgment of an incurable 
disease, and the goal of palliative therapy is embraced in the hope of 
being  able  to  live  with  disease;  finally,  at  the  disclosure  of  imminent 
death, another adjustment in outlook takes place. The patient imagines 
the worst in preparation for the end of life and may go through stages 
of  adjustment  to  the  diagnosis.  These  stages  include  denial,  isola-
tion,  anger,  bargaining,  depression,  acceptance,  and  hope.  Of  course, 
patients do not all progress through all the stages or proceed through 
them in the same order or at the same rate. Nevertheless, developing 
an understanding of how the patient has been affected by the diagnosis 
and is coping with it is an important goal of patient management.

It is best to speak frankly with the patient and the family regarding 
the likely course of disease. These discussions can be difficult for the 
physician as well as for the patient and family. The critical features of 
the interaction are to reassure the patient and family that everything 
that  can  be  done  to  provide  comfort  will  be  done.  They  will  not  be 
abandoned. Many patients prefer to be cared for in their homes or in 
a hospice setting rather than a hospital. The American College of Phy-
sicians has published a book called Home Care Guide for Cancer: How 
to  Care  for  Family  and  Friends  at  Home  that  teaches  an  approach  to 
successful problem-solving in home care. With appropriate planning, 
it should be possible to provide the patient with the necessary medical 
care as well as the psychological and spiritual support that will prevent 
the isolation and depersonalization that can attend in-hospital death.

The care of dying patients may take a toll on the physician. A “burn-
out” syndrome has been described that is characterized by fatigue, dis-
engagement from patients and colleagues, and a loss of self-fulfillment. 
Efforts at stress reduction, maintenance of a balanced life, and setting 
realistic goals may combat this disorder.

End-of-Life  Decisions  Unfortunately,  a  smooth  transition  in 
treatment  goals  from  curative  to  palliative  may  not  be  possible  in  all 
cases  because  of  the  occurrence  of  serious  treatment-related  compli-
cations  or  rapid  disease  progression.  Vigorous  and  invasive  medical 
support for a reversible disease or treatment complication is assumed 
to be justified. However, if the reversibility of the condition is in doubt,

the patient’s wishes determine the level of medical care. These wishes 
should  be  elicited  before  the  terminal  phase  of  illness  and  reviewed 
periodically.  Information  about  advance  directives  can  be  obtained 
from the American Association of Retired Persons, 601 E Street, NW, 
Washington, DC 20049, 202-434-2277, or Choice in Dying, 250 West 
57th  Street,  New  York,  NY  10107,  212-366-5540.  Some  states  allow 
physicians to assist patients who choose to end their lives. This subject 
is challenging from an ethical and a medical point of view. Discussions 
of  end-of-life  decisions  should  be  candid  and  involve  clear  informed 
consent, waiting periods, second opinions, and documentation. A full 
discussion of end-of-life management is provided in Chap. 12.

70 Prevention and Early 
Detection of Cancer
Jennifer M. Croswell, Otis W. Brawley,  
Barnett S. Kramer

Improved understanding of carcinogenesis has allowed cancer preven-
tion and early detection to expand beyond identification and avoidance 
of  carcinogens.  Specific  interventions  to  reduce  cancer  mortality  by 
preventing  cancer  in  those  at  risk  and  effective  screening  for  early 
detection of cancer are the goals.

Carcinogenesis is a process that usually extends over years, a con-
tinuum  of  discrete  tissue  and  cellular  changes  over  time  resulting  in 
aberrant physiologic processes. Prevention concerns the identification 
and  manipulation  of  the  biologic,  environmental,  social,  and  genetic 
factors in the causal pathway of cancer. Examination of national epi-
demiologic patterns can provide indicators of the relative contributions 
of advances in prevention, screening, and therapy in progress against 
cancer, but randomized trials provide the best evidence to guide prac-
tice, especially in the healthy general population.

EDUCATION AND HEALTHFUL HABITS
Public education on the avoidance of identified risk factors for cancer 
and encouraging healthy habits contributes to cancer prevention. The 
clinician is a powerful messenger in this process. The patient-provider 
encounter provides an opportunity to teach patients about the hazards 
of  smoking,  influence  of  a  healthy  lifestyle  and  other  exposures,  and 
use of proven cancer screening methods.
 ■ SMOKING CESSATION
Tobacco smoking is a strong, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer. Smokers have an ∼1 in 3 life-
time risk of dying prematurely from a tobacco-related cancer, cardio-
vascular, or pulmonary disease. Tobacco use causes more deaths from 
cardiovascular disease than from cancer. Lung cancer and cancers of 
the  larynx,  oropharynx,  esophagus,  kidney,  bladder,  colon,  pancreas, 
stomach, and uterine cervix are all tobacco related.

The number of cigarettes smoked per day and the level of inhalation 
of  cigarette  smoke  are  correlated  with  risk  of  lung  cancer  mortality. 
Light-  and  low-tar  cigarettes  are  not  safer  because  smokers  tend  to 
inhale them more frequently and deeply.

Those who stop smoking have a 30–50% lower 10-year lung cancer 
mortality rate compared to those who continue smoking, despite the 
fact  that  some  carcinogen-induced  gene  mutations  persist  for  years 
after smoking cessation. Smoking cessation and avoidance would save 
more lives than any other public health activity.

The  risk  of  tobacco  smoke  is  not  limited  to  the  smoker.  Environ-
mental  tobacco  smoke,  known  as  secondhand  or  passive  smoke,  is 
carcinogenic  and  associated  with  a  variety  of  respiratory  illnesses  in 
exposed children.

Tobacco use prevention is a pediatric issue. More than 80% of adult 
American smokers began smoking before the age of 18 years. Cigarette 
smoking  has  been  declining  in  recent  years,  but  in  recent  surveys, 
about 8% of high school students reported smoking within the prior 
month. Electronic cigarettes, on the other hand, are rapidly increasing 
in use: approximately 28% of high school students and 11% of middle 
school  students  are  current  electronic  cigarette  users.  Counseling  of 
adolescents and young adults is critical to prevent all forms of tobacco 
use.  A  clinician’s  simple  advice  can  be  of  benefit.  Providers  should 
query patients on tobacco use and offer smokers assistance in quitting.
Current  approaches  to  smoking  cessation  recognize  nicotine  in 
tobacco  as  addicting  (Chap.  454).  The  smoker  who  is  quitting  goes 
through  identifiable  stages,  including  contemplation  of  quitting,  an 
action  phase  in  which  the  smoker  quits,  and  a  maintenance  phase. 
Smokers  who  quit  completely  are  more  likely  to  be  successful  than 
those  who  gradually  reduce  the  number  of  cigarettes  smoked  or 
change  to  lower-tar  or  lower-nicotine  cigarettes.  Organized  cessation 
programs  may  help  individual  efforts.  Heavy  smokers  may  need  an 
intensive  broad-based  cessation  program  that  includes  counseling, 
behavioral  strategies,  and  pharmacologic  adjuncts,  such  as  nicotine 
replacement (gum, patches, sprays, lozenges, and inhalers), bupropion, 
and/or  varenicline.  Electronic  cigarettes  have  been  advocated  as  a 
tool to achieve smoking cessation in adults, but it is not known how 
effective  electronic  cigarettes  are  for  this  purpose.  The  net  effects  of 
electronic  cigarettes  on  health  are  poorly  studied.  Absence  of  strict 
manufacturing controls of vaping material has produced serious injury.
The health risks of cigars are similar to those of cigarettes. Smoking 
one or two cigars daily doubles the risk for oral and esophageal cancers; 
smoking  three  or  four  cigars  daily  increases  the  risk  of  oral  cancers 
more than eightfold and esophageal cancer fourfold. The risks of occa-
sional use are unknown.

Smokeless tobacco also represents a substantial health risk. Chewing 
tobacco is a carcinogen linked to dental caries, gingivitis, oral leukopla-
kia, and oral cancer. The systemic effects of smokeless tobacco (includ-
ing snuff) may increase risks for other cancers. Esophageal cancer is 
linked to carcinogens in tobacco dissolved in saliva and swallowed. The 
net effects of e-cigarettes on health are poorly studied.

 ■ PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of colon and breast 
cancer. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed. However, such 
studies are prone to confounding factors such as recall bias, association 
of exercise with other health-related practices, and effects of preclinical 
cancers on exercise habits (reverse causality).

 ■ DIET MODIFICATION
International  epidemiologic  studies  suggest  that  diets  high  in  fat  are 
associated  with  increased  risk  for  cancers  of  the  breast,  colon,  pros-
tate, and endometrium. Despite correlations, dietary fat has not been 
proven to cause cancer. Case-control and cohort epidemiologic studies 
give  conflicting  results.  Diet  is  a  highly  complex  exposure  to  many 
nutrients and chemicals. Low-fat diets are associated with many dietary 
changes  beyond  simple  subtraction  of  fat.  Other  lifestyle  factors  are 
also associated with adherence to a low-fat diet.

In  some  observational  studies,  dietary  fiber  has  been  associated 
with a reduced risk of colonic polyps and invasive cancer of the colon.

Two large prospective cohort studies of >100,000 health professionals 
showed  no  association  between  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  and  risk 
of  cancer,  however.  Cancer-protective  effects  of  increasing  fiber  and 
lowering dietary fat have not been shown in the context of a prospec-
tive clinical trial. The Polyp Prevention Trial randomly assigned 2000 
elderly persons, who had polyps removed, to a low-fat, high-fiber diet 
versus  routine  diet  for  4  years.  No  differences  were  noted  in  polyp 
formation.

The  U.S.  National  Institutes  of  Health  Women’s  Health  Initiative, 
launched  in  1994,  was  a  long-term  clinical  trial  enrolling  >100,000 
women age 45–69 years. It placed women into 22 intervention groups. 
Participants  received  calcium/vitamin  D  supplementation;  hormone 
replacement  therapy;  and  counseling  to  increase  exercise,  eat  a  low-
fat  diet  with  increased  consumption  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  fiber, 
and cease smoking. The study showed that although dietary fat intake 
was lower in the diet intervention group, invasive breast cancers were 
not reduced over an 8-year follow-up period compared to the control 
group.  Additionally,  no  reduction  was  seen  in  the  incidence  of  col-
orectal cancer in the dietary intervention arm. In the aggregate, cohort 
studies  and  randomized  trials  suggest  that  reduction  of  red  meat  or 
processed  meat  consumption  has  a  small  (if  any)  effect  on  cancer 
incidence  and  mortality,  although  the  overall  evidence  base  is  weak. 
Evidence  does  not  currently  establish  the  anticarcinogenic  value  of 
vitamin, mineral, or nutritional supplements in amounts greater than 
those provided by a balanced diet.

 ■ ENERGY BALANCE
Risk of certain cancers appears to increase modestly (relative risks gen-
erally in the 1.0–2.0 range) as body mass index (BMI) increases beyond 
25  kg/m2.  A  cohort  study  of  >5  million  adults  included  in  the  U.K. 
Clinical  Practice  Research  Datalink  (a  primary  care  database)  found 
that each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was linearly associated with cancers 
of the uterus, gallbladder, kidney, cervix, thyroid, and leukemia. High 
BMI appears to have an inverse association with prostate and premeno-
pausal breast cancer.

 ■ SUN AVOIDANCE
Nonmelanoma skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell) are induced 
by  cumulative  exposure  to  ultraviolet  (UV)  radiation.  Sunburns, 
especially  in  childhood  and  adolescence,  may  be  associated  with  an 
increased risk of melanoma in adulthood. Reduction of sun exposure 
through  use  of  protective  clothing  and  changing  patterns  of  outdoor 
activities can reduce skin cancer risk. Sunscreens decrease the risk of 
actinic keratoses, the precursor to squamous cell skin cancer, but mel-
anoma risk may not be reduced. Sunscreens prevent burning, but they 
may encourage more prolonged exposure to the sun and may not filter 
out wavelengths of energy that cause melanoma.

Appearance-focused  behavioral  interventions  in  young  women 
can decrease indoor tanning use and other UV exposures and may be 
more effective than messages about long-term cancer risks. Those who 
recognize themselves as being at risk tend to be more compliant with 
sun-avoidance  recommendations.  Risk  factors  for  melanoma  include 
a propensity to sunburn, a large number of benign melanocytic nevi, 
and atypical nevi.

CANCER CHEMOPREVENTION
Chemoprevention  involves  the  use  of  specific  natural  or  synthetic 
chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent carcinogenesis before 
the development of invasive malignancy.

Cancer  develops  through  an  accumulation  of  tissue  abnormalities 
associated  with  genetic  and  epigenetic  changes,  and  growth  regu-
latory  pathways  that  are  potential  points  of  intervention  to  prevent 
cancer.  The  initial  changes  are  termed  initiation.  The  alteration  can 
be  inherited  or  acquired  through  the  action  of  physical,  infectious, 
or  chemical  carcinogens.  Like  most  human  diseases,  cancer  arises 
from  an  interaction  between  genetics  and  environmental  exposures  
(Table 70-1). Influences that cause the initiated cell and its surround-
ing  tissue  microenvironment  to  progress  through  the  carcinogenic 
process  and  change  phenotypically  are  termed  promoters.  Promoters

aAgents that are thought to act as cancer initiators and/or promoters.

include  hormones  such  as  androgens,  linked  to  prostate  cancer,  and 
estrogen,  linked  to  breast  and  endometrial  cancer.  The  difference 
between an initiator and promoter is indistinct; some components of 
cigarette  smoke  are  “complete  carcinogens,”  acting  as  both  initiators 
and promoters. Cancer can be prevented or controlled through inter-
ference  with  the  factors  that  cause  cancer  initiation,  promotion,  or 
progression.  Compounds  of  interest  in  chemoprevention  often  have 
antimutagenic, hormone modulation, anti-inflammatory, antiprolifer-
ative, or proapoptotic activity (or a combination).
 ■ CHEMOPREVENTION OF CANCERS OF THE 
UPPER AERODIGESTIVE TRACT
Smoking causes diffuse epithelial injury in the oral cavity, neck, esoph-
agus,  and  lung.  Patients  cured  of  squamous  cell  cancers  of  the  lung, 
esophagus, oral cavity, and neck are at risk (as high as 5% per year) of 
developing second cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. Cessation 
of  cigarette  smoking  does  not  markedly  decrease  the  cured  cancer 
patient’s  risk  of  second  malignancy,  even  though  it  does  lower  the 
cancer risk in those who have never developed a malignancy. Smoking 
cessation may halt the early stages of the carcinogenic process (such as 
metaplasia), but it may have no effect on late stages of carcinogenesis.

492 This  “field  carcinogenesis”  hypothesis  for  upper  aerodigestive  tract 
cancer has made “cured” patients an important population for chemo-
prevention of second malignancies.

Persistent oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly 
HPV-16, increases the risk for cancers of the oropharynx. This associa-
tion exists even in the absence of other risk factors such as smoking or 
alcohol use (although the magnitude of increased risk appears greater 
than additive when HPV infection and smoking are both present). Oral 
HPV  infection  is  believed  to  be  largely  sexually  acquired.  Although 
the evidence is not definitive, the use of the HPV vaccine is associated 
with  a  reduction  in  prevalence  of  oropharyngeal  infection  rates  and 
may  eventually  reduce  oropharyngeal  cancer  rates  (unlike  cancers  of 
the cervix, no precursor lesion for oropharyngeal tumors is known).

Oral leukoplakia, a premalignant lesion commonly found in smok-
ers,  has  been  used  as  an  intermediate  marker  of  chemopreventive 
activity  in  smaller  shorter-duration,  randomized,  placebo-controlled 
trials. Although therapy with high, relatively toxic doses of isotretinoin 
(13-cis-retinoic acid) causes regression of oral leukoplakia, more toler-
able doses of isotretinoin have not shown benefit in the prevention of 
head and neck cancer.

Several large-scale trials have assessed agents in the chemopreven-
tion  of  lung  cancer  in  patients  at  high  risk.  In  the  α-tocopherol/β- 
carotene (ATBC) Lung Cancer Prevention Trial, participants were male 
smokers,  age  50–69  years  at  entry.  Participants  had  smoked  an  aver-
age of one pack of cigarettes per day for nearly 36 years. Participants 
received  α-tocopherol,  β-carotene,  and/or  placebo  in  a  randomized, 
two-by-two  factorial  design.  After  median  follow-up  of  6  years,  lung 
cancer incidence and mortality were statistically significantly increased 
in those receiving β-carotene. α-Tocopherol had no effect on lung can-
cer  mortality.  However,  patients  receiving  α-tocopherol  had  a  higher 
incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.

The β-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) involved 17,000 
American smokers and workers with asbestos exposure. Entrants were 
randomly assigned to one of four arms and received β-carotene, retinol, 
and/or placebo in a two-by-two factorial design. This trial also demon-
strated harm from β-carotene: a lung cancer rate of 5 per 1000 subjects 
per year for those taking placebo versus 6 per 1000 subjects per year 
for those taking β-carotene.

The  ATBC  and  CARET  results  demonstrate  the  importance  of 
testing  chemoprevention  hypotheses  thoroughly  before  widespread 
implementation  because  the  results  contradict  a  number  of  observa-
tional studies.

 ■ CHEMOPREVENTION OF COLON CANCER
Many colon cancer prevention trials are based on the premise that most 
colorectal cancers develop from adenomatous polyps. These trials use 
adenoma recurrence or disappearance as a surrogate endpoint (not yet 
validated) for colon cancer prevention. Clinical trial results suggest that 
nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  such  as  piroxicam, 
sulindac, and aspirin, may prevent adenoma formation or cause regres-
sion of adenomatous polyps. The mechanism of action of NSAIDs is 
unknown, but they are presumed to work through the cyclooxygenase 
pathway. A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials (albeit 
primarily  designed  to  examine  aspirin’s  effects  on  cardiovascular 
events) found that aspirin at doses of at least 75 mg/d resulted in a 33% 
relative reduction in colorectal cancer incidence after 20 years, with no 
clear increase in efficacy at higher doses. Based on a systematic review 
of evidence from randomized trials for primary prevention of cardio-
vascular disease, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that 
the balance of benefits and harms favored initiating low-dose aspirin 
for  colorectal  cancer  and  cardiovascular  disease  prevention  in  adults 
age 50–59 if they have a 10% or greater 10-year risk of cardiovascular 
disease. Low-dose aspirin does not appear to benefit the elderly, how-
ever. The ASPREE trial, which compared 100 mg of daily aspirin to pla-
cebo for improvement in the composite endpoint of death, dementia, or 
survival in the healthy elderly, was stopped because of a lack of benefit, 
including cancer. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been con-
sidered for colorectal cancer and polyp prevention. Trials with COX-2 
inhibitors were initiated, but an increased risk of cardiovascular events 

in those taking the COX-2 inhibitors was noted, suggesting that these 
agents are not suitable for chemoprevention in the general population.
The Women’s Health Initiative demonstrated that postmenopausal 
women taking estrogen plus progestin have a 44% lower relative risk 
of  colorectal  cancer  compared  to  women  taking  placebo.  Of  >16,600 
women randomized and followed for a median of 5.6 years, 43 inva-
sive colorectal cancers occurred in the hormone group and 72 in the 
placebo group. The positive effect on colon cancer is mitigated by the 
modest  increase  in  cardiovascular  and  breast  cancer  risks  associated 
with combined estrogen plus progestin therapy.

Most  case-control  and  cohort  studies  have  not  confirmed  early 
reports of an association between regular statin use and a reduced risk 
of  colorectal  cancer.  No  randomized  controlled  trials  have  addressed 
this  hypothesis.  A  meta-analysis  of  statin  use  showed  no  protective 
effect of statins on overall cancer incidence or death.

 ■ CHEMOPREVENTION OF BREAST CANCER
Tamoxifen  is  an  antiestrogen  with  partial  estrogen  agonistic  activity 
in some tissues, such as endometrium and bone. One of its actions is 
to  upregulate  transforming  growth  factor  β,  which  decreases  breast 
cell  proliferation.  In  a  randomized  placebo-controlled  prevention 
trial involving >13,000 pre- and postmenopausal women at high risk, 
tamoxifen  decreased  the  risk  of  developing  breast  cancer  by  49% 
(from 43.4 to 22 per 1000 women) after a median follow-up of nearly 
6  years.  Tamoxifen  also  reduced  bone  fractures;  a  small  increase  in 
risk of endometrial cancer, stroke, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein 
thrombosis  was  noted.  The  International  Breast  Cancer  Intervention 
Study  (IBIS-I)  and  the  Italian  Randomized  Tamoxifen  Prevention 
Trial  also  demonstrated  a  reduction  in  breast  cancer  incidence  with 
tamoxifen  use.  A  trial  comparing  tamoxifen  with  another  selective 
estrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene, performed in postmenopausal 
women  showed  that  raloxifene  is  comparable  to  tamoxifen  in  cancer 
prevention, but without the risk of endometrial cancer. Raloxifene was 
associated  with  a  smaller  reduction  in  invasive  breast  cancers  and  a 
trend  toward  more  noninvasive  breast  cancers,  but  fewer  thrombo-
embolic events than tamoxifen; the drugs are similar in risks of other 
cancers, fractures, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Both tamoxifen 
and raloxifene (the latter for postmenopausal women only) have been 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for reduc-
tion of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease (1.66% risk at  
5 years based on the Gail risk model: http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/).
Because  the  aromatase  inhibitors  are  even  more  effective  than 
tamoxifen in adjuvant breast cancer therapy, it has been hypothesized 
that  they  would  be  more  effective  in  breast  cancer  prevention.  A 
randomized,  placebo-controlled  trial  of  exemestane  reported  a  65% 
relative reduction (from 5.5 to 1.9 per 1000 women) in the incidence 
of  invasive  breast  cancer  in  women  at  elevated  risk  after  a  median 
follow-up of about 3 years. Common adverse effects included arthral-
gias, hot flashes, fatigue, and insomnia. No trial has directly compared 
aromatase  inhibitors  with  selective  estrogen  receptor  modulators  for 
breast cancer chemoprevention.

 ■ CHEMOPREVENTION OF PROSTATE CANCER
Finasteride and dutasteride are 5-α-reductase inhibitors. They inhibit 
conversion  of  testosterone  to  dihydrotestosterone  (DHT),  a  potent 
stimulator of prostate cell proliferation. The Prostate Cancer Preven-
tion  Trial  (PCPT)  randomly  assigned  men  age  55  years  or  older  at 
average  risk  of  prostate  cancer  to  finasteride  or  placebo.  All  men  in 
the  trial  were  being  regularly  screened  with  prostate-specific  antigen 
(PSA)  levels  and  digital  rectal  examination.  After  7  years  of  therapy, 
the  incidence  of  prostate  cancer  was  18.4%  in  the  finasteride  arm, 
compared  with  24.4%  in  the  placebo  arm,  a  statistically  significant 
difference.  However,  the  finasteride  group  had  more  patients  with 
tumors of Gleason score 7 and higher compared with the placebo arm 
(6.4  vs  5.1%).  Long-term  (10–15  years)  follow-up  did  not  reveal  any 
statistically significant differences in overall or prostate cancer-specific 
mortality  between  all  men  in  the  finasteride  and  placebo  arms  or  in 
men diagnosed with prostate cancer, but the power to detect a differ-
ence was limited.

Dutasteride has also been evaluated as a preventive agent for pros-
tate cancer. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events 
(REDUCE) trial was a randomized double-blind trial in which ∼8200 
men  with  an  elevated  PSA  (2.5–10  ng/mL  for  men  age  50–60  years 
and 3–10 ng/mL for men age 60 years or older) and negative prostate 
biopsy on enrollment received daily 0.5 mg of dutasteride or placebo. 
The trial found a statistically significant 23% relative risk reduction in 
the incidence of biopsy-detected prostate cancer in the dutasteride arm 
at 4 years of treatment (659 cases vs 858 cases, respectively). Overall, 
across years 1 through 4, no difference was seen between the arms in 
the number of tumors with a Gleason score of 7 to 10; however, during 
years 3 and 4, there was a statistically significant difference in tumors 
with  Gleason  score  of  8  to  10  in  the  dutasteride  arm  (12  tumors  vs  
1 tumor, respectively).

The  clinical  importance  of  the  apparent  increased  incidence  of 
higher-grade tumors in the 5-α-reductase inhibitor arms of these trials 
likely represents an increased sensitivity of PSA and digital rectal exam 
for high-grade tumors in men receiving these agents due to a decrease 
in prostatic volume. Although the FDA acknowledged that detection 
bias  may  have  accounted  for  the  finding,  a  causative  role  for  5-α- 
reductase inhibitors could not be conclusively dismissed. These agents 
are therefore not FDA-approved for prostate cancer prevention.

Because all men in both the PCPT and REDUCE trials were being 
screened  and  because  screening  approximately  doubles  the  rate  of 
prostate cancer, it is not known if finasteride or dutasteride decreases 
the  risk  of  prostate  cancer  in  men  who  are  not  being  screened  or 
simply  reduces  the  risk  of  non-life-threatening  cancers  detectable  
by screening.

Several  favorable  laboratory  and  observational  studies  led  to  the 
formal evaluation of selenium and α-tocopherol (vitamin E) as poten-
tial prostate cancer preventives. The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer 
Prevention  Trial  (SELECT)  assigned  35,533  men  to  receive  200  μg/d 
selenium, 400 IU/d α-tocopherol, selenium plus vitamin E, or placebo. 
After a median follow-up of 7 years, a trend toward an increased risk 
of developing prostate cancer was observed for men taking vitamin E 
alone as compared to the placebo arm (hazard ratio 1.17; 95% confi-
dence interval, 1.004–1.36).
 ■ VACCINES AND CANCER PREVENTION
A  number  of  infectious  agents  cause  cancer.  Hepatitis  B  and  C  are 
linked to liver cancer; some HPV strains are linked to cervical, anal, 
and head and neck cancer; and  Helicobacter  pylori is associated with 
gastric  adenocarcinoma  and  gastric  lymphoma.  Vaccines  to  protect 
against these agents may therefore reduce the risk of their associated 
cancers.

The  hepatitis  B  vaccine  is  effective  in  preventing  hepatitis  and 

hepatomas due to chronic hepatitis B infection.

A nonavalent vaccine (covering HPV strains 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 
52, and 58) is available for use in the United States. HPV types 6 and 
11 cause genital papillomas. The remaining HPV types cause cervical 
and anal cancer; reduction in HPV types 16 and 18 alone could prevent 
>70%  of  cervical  cancers  worldwide.  For  individuals  not  previously 
infected  with  these  HPV  strains,  the  vaccine  demonstrates  high  effi-
cacy  in  preventing  persistent  strain-specific  HPV  infections.  Studies 
also confirm the vaccine’s ability to prevent preneoplastic lesions (cer-
vical  or  anal  intraepithelial  neoplasia  [CIN/AIN]  I,  II,  and  III).  The 
durability of the immune response beyond 10–12 years is not currently 
known. The vaccine does not appear to impact preexisting infections. 
A  two-dose  schedule  is  currently  recommended  in  the  United  States 
for females and males age 9–14 years; teens and young adults who start 
the series between 15 and 26 years are recommended to receive three 
doses  of  the  vaccine.  However,  observational  studies  suggest  similar 
efficacy with a single dose in young girls, and a large randomized trial 
is currently comparing one to two doses.

SURGICAL PREVENTION OF CANCER
Some organs in some individuals are at such high risk of developing 
cancer  that  surgical  removal  of  the  organ  at  risk  may  be  considered. 
Women  with  severe  cervical  dysplasia  are  treated  with  laser  or  loop 

electrosurgical  excision  or  conization.  Colectomy  may  be  used  to 
prevent colon cancer in patients with familial polyposis or ulcerative 
colitis.

Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy may be chosen for breast cancer 
prevention among women with genetic predisposition to breast cancer. 
In a prospective series of 139 women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 muta-
tions, 76 chose to undergo prophylactic mastectomy, and 63 chose close 
surveillance. At 3 years, no cases of breast cancer had been diagnosed 
in those opting for surgery, but eight patients in the surveillance group 
had developed breast cancer. A larger (n = 639) retrospective cohort 
study  reported  that  three  patients  developed  breast  cancer  after  pro-
phylactic mastectomy compared with an expected incidence of 30–53 
cases.  Postmastectomy  breast  cancer–related  deaths  were  81–94% 
lower  in  high-risk  women  compared  with  sister  controls  and  100% 
lower in moderate-risk women when compared with expected rates.

Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy may also be employed for the 
prevention of ovarian and breast cancers among high-risk women. A 
prospective cohort study evaluating the outcomes of BRCA mutation 
carriers  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  association  between 
prophylactic  salpingo-oophorectomy  and  a  reduced  incidence  of 
ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer (36% relative risk reduction, or 
a 4.5% absolute difference). Studies of prophylactic oophorectomy for 
prevention  of  breast  cancer  in  women  with  genetic  mutations  have 
shown relative risks of approximately 0.50; the risk reduction may be 
greatest for women having the procedure at younger (i.e., <50 years) 
ages.  The  observation  that  most  high-grade  serous  “ovarian  cancers” 
actually  arise  in  the  fallopian  tube  fimbria  raises  the  possibility  that 
this lethal subtype may be prevented by ovary-sparing salpingectomy.
All of the evidence concerning the use of prophylactic mastectomy 
and salpingo-oophorectomy for prevention of breast and ovarian can-
cer in high-risk women has been observational in nature; such studies 
are  prone  to  a  variety  of  biases,  including  case  selection  bias,  family 
relationships between patients and controls, and inadequate informa-
tion about hormone use. Thus, they may give an overestimate of the 
magnitude of benefit.

 ■ CANCER SCREENING
Screening is a means of early detection in asymptomatic individuals, 
with the goal of decreasing morbidity and mortality. While screening 
can potentially reduce disease-specific deaths and has been shown to 
do so in cervical, colon, lung, and breast cancer, it is also subject to a 
number of biases that can suggest a benefit when actually there is none. 
Biases can even mask net harm. Early detection does not in itself confer 
benefit. Cause-specific mortality, rather than survival after diagnosis, is 
the preferred endpoint (see below).

Because  screening  is  done  on  asymptomatic,  healthy  persons,  it 
should  offer  substantial  likelihood  of  benefit  that  outweighs  harm. 
Screening tests and their appropriate use should be carefully evaluated 
before their use is widely encouraged in screening programs.

A large and increasing number of genetic mutations and nucleotide 
polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. 
Testing for these genetic mutations could in theory define a high-risk 
population. However, most of the identified mutations have very low 
penetrance and individually provide limited predictive accuracy. The 
ability to predict the development of a particular cancer may someday 
present therapeutic options as well as ethical dilemmas. It may eventu-
ally allow for early intervention to prevent a cancer or limit its severity. 
People at high risk may be ideal candidates for chemoprevention and 
screening;  however,  efficacy  of  these  interventions  in  the  high-risk 
population should be investigated. Currently, persons at high risk for a 
particular cancer can engage in intensive screening. While this course 
is clinically reasonable, it is not known if it reduces mortality in these 
populations.

The Accuracy of Screening  A  screening  test’s  accuracy  or  abil-
ity  to  discriminate  disease  is  described  by  four  indices:  sensitivity, 
specificity,  positive  predictive  value,  and  negative  predictive  value  
(Table 70-2). Sensitivity, also called the true-positive rate, is the pro-
portion  of  persons  with  the  disease  who  test  positive  in  the  screen

aFor diseases of low prevalence, such as cancer, poor specificity has a dramatic

(i.e., the ability of the test to detect disease when it is present). Specificity, 
or 1 minus the false-positive rate, is the proportion of persons who do 
not  have  the  disease  who  test  negative  in  the  screening  test  (i.e.,  the 
ability of a test to correctly indicate that the disease is not present). The 
positive predictive value is the proportion of persons who test positive 
and who actually have the disease. Similarly, negative predictive value 
is  the  proportion  testing  negative  who  do  not  have  the  disease.  The 
sensitivity and specificity of a test are independent of the underlying 
prevalence (or risk) of the disease in the population screened, but the 
predictive values depend strongly on the prevalence of the disease.

Screening  is  most  beneficial,  efficient,  and  economical  when  the 
target disease is common in the population being screened. Specific-
ity is at least as important to the ultimate feasibility and success of a 
screening test as sensitivity.

Potential Biases of Screening Tests  Common biases of screen-
ing are lead time, length-biased sampling, and selection. These biases 
can make a screening test seem beneficial when actually it is not (or 
even causes net harm). Whether beneficial or not, screening can create 
the false impression of an epidemic by increasing the number of can-
cers diagnosed. It can also produce a shift in the proportion of patients 
diagnosed  at  an  early  stage  (even  without  a  reduction  in  absolute 
incidence  of  late-stage  disease)  and  inflate  survival  statistics  without 
reducing  mortality  (i.e.,  the  number  of  deaths  from  a  given  cancer 
relative to the number of those at risk for the cancer). In such a case, 
the  apparent  duration  of  survival  (measured  from  date  of  diagnosis) 
increases without lives being saved or life expectancy changed.

Lead-time bias occurs whether or not a test influences the natural 
history of the disease; the patient is merely diagnosed at an earlier date. 
Survival appears increased even if life is not prolonged. The screening 
test  only  prolongs  the  time  the  subject  is  aware  of  the  disease  and 
spends as a cancer patient.

Length-biased  sampling  occurs  because  screening  tests  generally 
can  more  easily  detect  slow-growing,  less  aggressive  cancers  than 
fast-growing cancers. Cancers diagnosed due to the onset of symptoms 
between  scheduled  screenings  are  on  average  more  aggressive,  and 
treatment  outcomes  are  not  as  favorable.  An  extreme  form  of  length 
bias  sampling  is  termed  overdiagnosis,  the  detection  of  “pseudo  dis-
ease.” The reservoir of some undetected slow-growing tumors is large. 
Many  of  these  tumors  fulfill  the  histologic  criteria  of  cancer  but  will 
never become clinically significant or cause death during the patient’s 
remaining life span. This problem is compounded by the fact that the 

most common cancers appear most frequently at ages when competing 
causes of death are more frequent.

Selection  bias  occurs  because  the  population  most  likely  to  seek 
screening  often  differs  from  the  general  population  to  which  the 
screening test might be applied. In general, volunteers for studies are 
more health conscious and likely to have a better prognosis or lower 
mortality rate, irrespective of the screening result. This is termed the 
healthy volunteer effect.

Potential Drawbacks of Screening  Risks associated with screen-
ing include harm caused by the screening intervention itself, harm due 
to  the  further  investigation  of  persons  with  positive  tests  (both  true 
and  false  positives),  and  harm  from  the  treatment  of  persons  with  a 
true-positive result, whether or not life is extended by treatment (e.g., 
even  if  a  screening  test  reduces  relative  cause-specific  mortality  by 
15–30%,  70–85%  of  those  diagnosed  still  go  on  to  die  of  the  target 
cancer).  The  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  cancers  that  would  never 
have  caused  medical  problems  can  lead  to  the  harm  of  unnecessary 
treatment and give patients the anxiety of a cancer diagnosis. The psy-
chosocial impact of cancer screening can be substantial when applied 
to the entire population.

Assessment  of  Screening  Tests  Good  clinical  trial  design  can 
offset some biases of screening and demonstrate the relative risks and 
benefits  of  a  screening  test.  A  randomized  controlled  screening  trial 
with  cause-specific  mortality  as  the  endpoint  provides  the  strongest 
support  for  a  screening  intervention.  Overall  mortality  should  also 
be  reported  to  detect  an  adverse  effect  of  screening  and  treatment 
on  other  disease  outcomes  (e.g.,  cardiovascular  disease,  treatment- 
induced cancers). In a randomized trial, two like populations are ran-
domly established. One is given the usual standard of care (which may 
be no screening at all) and the other receives the screening intervention 
being assessed. Efficacy for the population studied is established when 
the group receiving the screening test has a better cause-specific mor-
tality rate than the control group. Studies showing a reduction in the 
incidence of advanced-stage disease, improved survival, or a stage shift 
are weaker (and possibly misleading) evidence of benefit. These latter 
criteria are early indicators but not sufficient to establish the value of 
a screening test.

Although  a  randomized,  controlled  screening  trial  provides  the 
strongest evidence to support a screening test, it is not perfect. Unless 
the trial is population-based, it does not remove the question of gen-
eralizability to the target population. Screening trials generally involve 
thousands of persons and last for years. Less definitive study designs 
are therefore often used to estimate the effectiveness of screening prac-
tices. However, every nonrandomized study design is subject to strong 
confounders.  In  descending  order  of  strength,  evidence  may  also  be 
derived from the findings of internally controlled trials using interven-
tion allocation methods other than randomization (e.g., allocation by 
birth  date,  date  of  clinic  visit);  the  findings  of  analytic  observational 
studies; or the results of multiple time series studies with or without 
the intervention.

Screening  for  Specific  Cancers  Screening  for  cervical,  colon, 
and  breast  cancer  has  the  potential  to  be  beneficial  for  certain  age 
groups. Depending on age and smoking history, lung cancer screening 
can also be beneficial in specific settings. Special surveillance of those 
at high risk for a specific cancer because of a family history or a genetic 
risk factor may be prudent, but few studies have assessed the effect on 
mortality. A number of organizations have considered whether or not 
to endorse routine use of certain screening tests. Because criteria have 
varied, they have arrived at different recommendations. The American 
Cancer  Society  (ACS)  and  the  U.S.  Preventive  Services  Task  Force 
(USPSTF)  publish  screening  guidelines  (Table  70-3);  the  American 
Academy  of  Family  Practitioners  (AAFP)  often  follows/endorses  the 
USPSTF  recommendations;  and  the  American  College  of  Physicians 
(ACP)  develops  recommendations  based  on  structured  reviews  of 
other organizations’ guidelines.

Currently, there are no reliable screening tests for the early 
detection of ovarian cancer. For women at high risk of ovarian 
cancer, it has not been proven that using transvaginal ultrasound 
or serum CA-125 lowers their chances of dying from ovarian 
cancer.
Starting at age 50, men at average risk and with a life expectancy 
of ≥10 years should talk to a doctor about the uncertainties, risks, 
and potential benefits of screening. If African American or have 
a father or brother who had prostate cancer before age 65, men 
should have this talk starting at age 45. For men with more than 
one first-degree relative with prostate cancer diagnosed before 
age 65, have this talk starting at age 40. How often they are 
screened will depend on their PSA level.
As for PSA; if men decide to be tested, they should have the PSA 
blood test with or without a rectal exam.

aSummary of the screening procedures recommended for the general population by the USPSTF and the ACS. These recommendations refer to asymptomatic persons 
who are not known to have risk factors, other than age or gender, for the targeted condition. bUSPSTF lettered recommendations are defined as follows: “A”: The USPSTF 
recommends the service because there is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial; “B”: The USPSTF recommends the service because there is high certainty 
that the net benefit is moderate or moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial; “C”: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this 
service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences; there is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small; “D”: The USPSTF 
recommends against the service because there is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits; “I”: The USPSTF 
concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service.

BREAST CANCER  Breast self-examination, clinical breast examination 
by a caregiver, mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
have all been variably advocated as useful screening tools.

A number of trials have suggested that annual or biennial screen-
ing  with  mammography  in  normal-risk  women  older  than  age  
50  years  decreases  breast  cancer  mortality.  Each  trial  has  been  crit-
icized  for  design  flaws.  In  most  trials,  breast  cancer–related  mortal-
ity  rates  were  decreased  by  15–30%.  Experts  disagree  on  whether  
average-risk women age 40–49 years should receive regular screening 
(Table 70-3). The U.K. Age Trial, the only randomized trial of breast 
cancer screening to specifically evaluate the impact of mammography 
in women age 40–49 years, found no statistically significant difference 
in  breast  cancer  mortality  for  screened  women  versus  controls  after 
about 11 years of follow-up (relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval 
0.66–1.04); however, <70% of women received screening in the inter-
vention arm, potentially diluting the observed effect. A meta-analysis 
of  nine  large  randomized  trials  showed  an  8%  relative  reduction  in 
mortality (relative risk 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.75–1.02) from 
mammography screening for women age 39–49 years after 11–20 years 
of  follow-up.  This  is  equivalent  to  3  breast  cancer  deaths  prevented 
per  10,000  women  >10  years  (although  the  result  is  not  statistically 
significant). At the same time, nearly half of women age 40–49 years 
screened annually will have false-positive mammograms necessitating 
further evaluation, often including biopsy. Estimates of overdiagnosis 
range  from  10  to  50%  of  diagnosed  invasive  cancers.  In  the  United 
States, widespread screening over the past several decades has not been 
accompanied by a reduction in incidence of metastatic breast cancer 
despite a large increase in early-stage disease, suggesting a substantial 
amount of overdiagnosis at the population level. In addition, the sub-
stantial  improvements  in  systemic  therapy  have  likely  decreased  the 
impact of mammography and early detection on falling breast cancer 
mortality rates.

Digital  breast  tomosynthesis  is  a  newer  method  of  breast  cancer 
screening  that  reconstructs  multiple  x-ray  images  of  the  breast  into 
superimposed  “three-dimensional”  slices.  Although  some  evidence 
is  available  concerning  the  test  characteristics  of  this  modality,  there 
are currently no data on its effects on health outcomes such as breast 
cancer–related  morbidity,  mortality,  or  overdiagnosis  rates.  A  large 
randomized trial comparing standard digital mammography to tomo-
synthesis is in progress.

No study of breast self-examination has shown it to decrease mortal-
ity. A randomized controlled trial of approximately 266,000 women in 
China demonstrated no difference in breast cancer mortality between 
a  group  that  received  intensive  breast  self-exam  instruction  and  
reinforcement/reminders and controls at 10 years of follow-up. How-
ever,  more  benign  breast  lesions  were  discovered  and  more  breast 
biopsies were performed in the self-examination arm.

Genetic  screening  for  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  mutations  and  other 
markers of breast cancer risk has identified a group of women at high 
risk  for  breast  cancer.  Unfortunately,  when  to  begin  and  the  optimal 
frequency of screening have not been defined. Mammography is less 
sensitive  at  detecting  breast  cancers  in  women  carrying  BRCA1  and 
BRCA2  mutations,  possibly  because  such  cancers  occur  in  younger 
women,  in  whom  mammography  is  known  to  be  less  sensitive.  MRI 
screening  may  be  more  sensitive  than  mammography  in  women  at 
high risk due to genetic predisposition or in women with very dense 
breast tissue, but specificity may be lower. An increase in overdiagnosis 
may  accompany  the  higher  sensitivity.  The  impact  of  MRI  on  breast 
cancer  mortality  with  or  without  concomitant  use  of  mammography 
has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

CERVICAL  CANCER  Screening  with  Papanicolaou  (Pap)  smears 
decreases cervical cancer mortality. The cervical cancer mortality rate 
has fallen substantially since the widespread use of the Pap smear. With

the  onset  of  sexual  activity  comes  the  risk  of  sexual  transmission  of 
HPV,  the  fundamental  etiologic  factor  for  cervical  cancer.  Screening 
guidelines  recommend  regular  Pap  testing  for  all  women  who  have 
reached  the  age  of  21  (before  this  age,  even  in  individuals  that  have 
begun sexual activity, screening may cause more harm than benefit). 
The  recommended  interval  for  Pap  screening  is  3  years.  In  all  cases, 
screening  more  frequently  adds  little  benefit  but  leads  to  important 
harms, including unnecessary procedures and overtreatment of tran-
sient lesions. Beginning at age 30, guidelines also include HPV testing 
with or without Pap smear. The screening interval for women who test 
normal using this approach may be lengthened to 5 years.

An upper age limit at which screening ceases to be effective is not 
known, but women age 65 years with no abnormal results in the pre-
vious 10 years may choose to stop screening. Screening should be dis-
continued in women who have undergone a hysterectomy with cervical 
excision for noncancerous reasons.

Although the efficacy of the Pap smear in reducing cervical cancer 
mortality  has  never  been  directly  confirmed  in  a  randomized,  con-
trolled  setting,  a  clustered  randomized  trial  in  India  evaluated  the 
impact of one-time cervical visual inspection and immediate colpos-
copy, biopsy, and/or cryotherapy (where indicated) versus counseling 
on cervical cancer deaths in women age 30–59 years. After 7 years of 
follow-up, the age-standardized rate of death due to cervical cancer was 
39.6 per 100,000 person-years in the intervention group versus 56.7 per 
100,000 person-years in controls.
COLORECTAL CANCER  Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), digital rec-
tal examination (DRE), rigid and flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, 
and computed tomography (CT) colonography have been considered 
for  colorectal  cancer  screening.  A  meta-analysis  of  five  randomized 
controlled  trials  demonstrated  a  22%  relative  reduction  in  colorec-
tal  cancer  mortality  after  two  to  nine  rounds  of  biennial  FOBT  at  
30 years of follow-up; annual screening was shown to result in a greater 
colorectal  cancer  mortality  reduction  in  a  single  trial  (a  32%  relative 
reduction).  However,  only  2–10%  of  those  with  occult  blood  in  the 
stool  have  cancer.  The  high  false-positive  rate  of  FOBT  substantially 
increases the number of colonoscopies performed.

Fecal  immunochemical  tests  (FITs)  have  higher  sensitivity  for 
colorectal  cancer  than  FOBT  tests.  Limited  observational  evidence 
suggests  FITs  may  have  lower  ability  to  detect  proximal  versus  distal 
colonic  tumors.  Multitargeted  stool  DNA  testing  combines  FIT  with 
testing for altered DNA biomarkers in cells that are shed into the stool. 
Although  limited  evidence  demonstrates  that  it  can  have  a  higher  
single-test  sensitivity  for  colorectal  cancer  than  FIT  alone,  its  speci-
ficity is lower, resulting in a higher number of false-positive tests and 
follow-up colonoscopies. There are no studies evaluating its effects on 
colorectal cancer incidence, morbidity, or mortality.

A blood test for the methylated SEPT9 gene associated with colorec-
tal cancer is available. However, its sensitivity is low, no longitudinal 
data have been collected on its performance or efficacy, and it is not 
recommended as a first-line screening test.

Two meta-analyses of five randomized controlled trials of sigmoidos-
copy found an 18% relative reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and 
a 28% relative reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. Participant ages 
ranged from 50 to 74 years, with follow-up ranging from 6 to 13 years. 
Diagnosis of adenomatous polyps by sigmoidoscopy should lead to eval-
uation of the entire colon with colonoscopy. The most efficient interval 
for screening sigmoidoscopy is unknown, but an interval of 5 years is 
often  recommended.  Case-control  studies  suggest  that  intervals  of  up 
to 15 years may confer benefit; the randomized U.K. trial demonstrated 
colorectal cancer mortality reduction with one-time screening.

One-time  colonoscopy  detects  ∼25%  more  advanced  lesions  (pol-
yps >10 mm, villous adenomas, adenomatous polyps with high-grade 
dysplasia, invasive cancer) than one-time FOBT with sigmoidoscopy; 
comparative  programmatic  performance  of  the  two  modalities  over 
time  is  not  known.  Perforation  rates  are  about  4/10,000  for  colonos-
copy  and  1/10,000  for  sigmoidoscopy.  Debate  continues  on  whether 
colonoscopy  is  too  expensive  and  invasive  and  whether  sufficient 
provider capacity exists to be recommended as the preferred screening 

tool in standard-risk populations. Some observational studies suggest 
that efficacy of colonoscopy to decrease colorectal cancer mortality is 
primarily limited to the left side of the colon.

CT colonography, if done at expert centers, appears to have a sensitiv-
ity for polyps ≥6 mm, comparable to colonoscopy. However, the rate of 
extracolonic findings of abnormalities of uncertain significance that must 
nevertheless be worked up is high (∼5–37%); the long-term cumulative 
radiation risk of repeated colonography screenings is also a concern.

LUNG CANCER  Chest x-ray and sputum cytology have been evaluated 
in  several  randomized  lung  cancer  screening  trials.  The  most  recent 
and largest (n = 154,901) of these, a component of the Prostate, Lung, 
Colorectal,  and  Ovarian  (PLCO)  cancer  screening  trial,  found  that, 
compared with usual care, annual chest x-ray did not reduce the risk 
of dying from lung cancer (relative risk 0.99; 95% confidence interval 
0.87–1.22) after 13 years. However, it showed evidence of overdiagno-
sis associated with chest x-ray. Low-dose CT has also been evaluated 
in  several  randomized  trials.  The  largest  and  longest  of  these,  the 
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), was a randomized controlled 
trial of screening for lung cancer in ∼53,000 persons age 55–74 years 
with a 30+ pack-year smoking history. It demonstrated a statistically 
significant reduction of about 3 fewer deaths per 1000 people screened 
with CT compared to chest x-ray after 12 years. However, the harms 
include the potential radiation risks associated with multiple scans, the 
discovery of incidental findings of unclear significance, and a high rate 
of false-positive test results. Both incidental findings and false-positive 
tests can lead to invasive diagnostic procedures associated with anxiety, 
expense, and complications (e.g., pneumo- or hemothorax after lung 
biopsy).  The  NLST  was  performed  at  experienced  screening  centers, 
and  the  balance  of  benefits  and  harms  may  differ  in  the  community 
setting at less experienced centers.

OVARIAN  CANCER  Adnexal  palpation,  transvaginal  ultrasound 
(TVUS),  and  serum  CA-125  assay  have  been  considered  for  ovarian 
cancer screening. A large randomized, controlled trial has shown that 
an  annual  screening  program  of  TVUS  and  CA-125  in  average-risk 
women does not reduce deaths from ovarian cancer (relative risk 1.21; 
95%  confidence  interval  0.99–1.48).  Adnexal  palpation  was  dropped 
early  in  the  study  because  it  did  not  detect  any  ovarian  cancers  that 
were not detected by either TVUS or CA-125. A second large random-
ized trial used a two-stage screening approach incorporating a risk of 
ovarian cancer algorithm that determined whether additional testing 
with  CA-125  or  TVUS  was  required.  At  14  years  of  follow-up,  there 
was no statistically significant reduction in ovarian cancer deaths. The 
risks and costs associated with the high number of false-positive results 
are impediments to routine use of these modalities for screening. In the 
PLCO trial, 10% of participants had a false-positive result from TVUS 
or CA-125, and one-third of these women underwent a major surgical 
procedure; the ratio of surgeries to screen-detected ovarian cancer was 
approximately 20:1. In September 2016, the FDA issued a safety com-
munication recommending against using any screening test, including 
the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm, for ovarian cancer.

PROSTATE  CANCER  The  most  common  prostate  cancer  screening 
modalities  are  digital  rectal  exam  (DRE)  and  serum  PSA  assay.  An 
emphasis on PSA screening has caused prostate cancer to become the 
most  common  nonskin  cancer  diagnosed  in  American  males.  This 
disease is prone to lead-time bias, length bias, and overdiagnosis, and 
substantial  debate  continues  among  experts  as  to  whether  screening 
should  be  offered  unless  the  patient  specifically  asks  to  be  screened. 
Virtually  all  organizations  stress  the  importance  of  informing  men 
about the uncertainty regarding screening efficacy and the associated 
harms.  Prostate  cancer  screening  clearly  detects  many  asymptomatic 
cancers,  but  the  ability  to  distinguish  tumors  that  are  lethal  but  still 
curable from those that pose little or no threat to health is limited, and 
randomized trials indicate that the effect of PSA screening on prostate 
cancer mortality across a population is, at best, small. Men older than 
age 50 years have a high prevalence of indolent, clinically insignificant 
prostate cancers (about 30–50% of men, increasing further as men age).

Two  major  randomized  controlled  trials  of  the  impact  of  PSA 
screening on prostate cancer mortality have been published. The PLCO 
Cancer  Screening  Trial  was  a  multicenter  U.S.  trial  that  randomized 
almost 77,000 men age 55–74 years to receive either annual PSA testing 
for 6 years or usual care. At 13 years of follow-up, no statistically sig-
nificant difference in the number of prostate cancer deaths was noted 
between the arms (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.87–1.36). 
More than half of men in the control arm received at least one PSA test 
during the trial, which may have diluted a small effect.

The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer 
(ERSPC)  was  a  multinational  study  that  randomized  ∼182,000  men 
between  age  50  and  74  years  (with  a  predefined  “core”  screening 
group  of  men  age  55–69  years)  to  receive  PSA  testing  or  no  screen-
ing.  Recruitment  and  randomization  procedures,  as  well  as  actual 
frequency of PSA testing, varied by country. After a median follow-up 
of  15.5  years,  a  20%  relative  reduction  in  the  risk  of  prostate  cancer 
death  in  the  screened  arm  was  noted  in  the  “core”  screening  group. 
The  trial  found  that  570  men  (95%  confidence  interval  380–1137 
men) would need to be invited to screening, and 18 cases of prostate 
cancer detected, to avert 1 death from prostate cancer. There was an 
unexplained imbalance in treatment between the two study arms, with 
a higher proportion of men with clinically localized cancer receiving 
radical prostatectomy in the screening arm and receiving it at experi-
enced referral centers.

Screening  must  be  linked  to  effective  therapy  in  order  to  have 
any  benefit.  Two  trials  conducted  after  the  initiation  of  widespread 
PSA  testing  did  not  find  a  substantial  decrease  in  prostate  cancer 
deaths  in  control  arms  of  “watchful  waiting”  or  monitoring  (i.e.,  no 
curative  treatment)  compared  to  radical  prostatectomy  or  radiation 
therapy. Prostate cancer–specific survival was very good (about 99%) 
and  nearly  identical  at  a  median  follow-up  of  10  years.  Treatments 
for  low-stage  prostate  cancer,  such  as  surgery  and  radiation  therapy, 
can  cause  substantial  morbidity,  including  impotence  and  urinary  
incontinence.

SKIN CANCER  Visual examination of all skin surfaces by the patient or 
by a health care provider is used in screening for basal and squamous 
cell cancers and melanoma. No prospective randomized study has been 
performed to look for a mortality decrease. Unfortunately, screening is 
associated with a substantial rate of overdiagnosis.

71 Cancer Genetics

Fred Bunz, Bert Vogelstein

CANCER IS A GENETIC DISEASE
Cancer  arises  through  a  series  of  somatic  alterations  in  DNA  that 
result  in  unrestrained  cellular  proliferation.  Most  of  these  alterations 
involve subtle sequence changes in DNA (i.e., mutations). The somatic 
mutations may originate as a consequence of random replication errors 
or exposure to carcinogens (e.g., radiation) and can be exacerbated by 
faulty  DNA  repair  processes.  While  most  cancers  arise  sporadically, 
clustering of cancers occurs in families that carry a germline mutation 
in a cancer gene.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
The idea that cancer progression is driven by sequential somatic muta-
tions in specific genes has only gained general acceptance in the past 
30 years. Before the advent of the microscope, cancer was believed to 
be  composed  of  aggregates  of  mucus  or  other  noncellular  matter.  By 
the middle of the nineteenth century, it became clear that tumors were 
masses of cells and that these cells arose from the normal cells of the 
tissue  from  which  the  cancer  originated.  The  molecular  basis  for  the 
uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells was to remain a mystery for 
another century. During that time, a number of theories for the origin of 
cancer were postulated. The great biochemist Otto Warburg proposed 
the combustion theory of cancer, which stipulated that cancer was due 
to abnormal oxygen metabolism. Others believed that all cancers were 
caused by viruses and that cancer was in fact a contagious disease.

In  the  end,  observations  of  cancer  occurring  in  chimney  sweeps, 
studies of x-rays, and the overwhelming data demonstrating cigarette 
smoke as a causative agent in lung cancer, together with Ames’s work 
on  chemical  mutagenesis,  were  consistent  with  the  idea  that  cancer 
originated  through  changes  in  DNA.  However,  it  was  not  until  the 
somatic mutations responsible for cancer were identified at the molec-
ular level that the genetic basis of cancer was definitively established. 
Although  the  viral  theory  of  cancer  did  not  prove  to  be  generally 
accurate (with exceptions such as human papillomaviruses, which can 
cause cervical and other cancers), the study of retroviruses led to the 
discovery  of  the  first  human  oncogenes  in  the  late  1970s.  Oncogenes 
are one of the two major classes of cancer driver genes. The study of 
families with genetic predisposition to cancer was instrumental to the 
discovery of the other major class of cancer driver genes, called tumor-
suppressor genes. Current technologies permit the sequence analysis of 
entire cancer genomes and provide a comprehensive view of the genetic 
changes  that  cause  tumors  to  arise  and  become  malignant.  The  field 
that studies the various types of mutations, as well as the consequences 
of these mutations in tumor cells, is now known as cancer genetics.

THE CLONAL ORIGIN AND MULTISTEP 
NATURE OF CANCER
Nearly  all  cancers  originate  from  a  single  cell;  this  clonal  origin  is  a 
critical  discriminating  feature  between  neoplasia  and  hyperplasia. 
Multiple cumulative mutational events are invariably required for the 
progression of a tumor from normal to fully malignant phenotype. The 
process  can  be  seen  as  Darwinian  microevolution  in  which,  at  each 
successive  step,  the  mutated  cells  gain  a  growth  advantage  resulting 
in the expansion of a neoplastic clone (Fig. 71-1). Based on observa-
tions of cancer frequency increases during aging, the epidemiologists 
Armitage and Doll and Nordling independently proposed that cancer 
is  a  result  of  three  discrete  cellular  changes.  Remarkably,  this  early 
model has been validated by extensive sequencing of cancer genomes. 
These studies revealed that just three causal mutations are required for 
the development of several of the most common cancers. Overall, it is 
currently believed that most common solid tumors require a minimum 
of  three  mutated  cancer  driver  genes  (either  oncogenes  or  tumor-
suppressor  genes)  for  their  development.  One  or  two  mutations  are

FIGURE 71-1  Multistep clonal development of malignancy. In this diagram, a series 
of three cumulative mutations, each with a modest growth advantage acting alone, 
eventually results in a malignant tumor. Note that not all such alterations result in 
progression.  The  actual  number  of  cumulative  mutations  necessary  to  transform 
from the normal to the malignant state has been estimated to be three for several 
of the most common types of cancer. (Adapted and modified from PC Nowell: The 
clonal evolution of tumor cell populations. Science 194:23, 1976.)

sufficient  for  benign  tumorigenesis,  but  not  for  the  invasive  capacity 
that distinguishes cancers from benign tumors. Less common tumors, 
such  as  liquid  tumors  (leukemias  or  lymphomas),  sarcomas,  and 
childhood tumors, appear to require only two driver gene alterations 
for malignancy. Note that a cancer driver gene is best defined as one 
containing a mutation that increases the selective growth advantage of 
the cell containing it. Normally, cell birth and cell death are in perfect 
equilibrium; every time a cell is born, another in the same lineage dies. 
Cancer driver gene mutations alter this equilibrium, so that more cells 
are born than die. The imbalance is often slight, so that the difference 
between cell birth and cell death can be less than 1%. This explains, in 
combination  with  the  low  rate  of  mutation,  why  tumorigenesis—the 
journey from a normal cell to a typical malignant, solid tumor—often 
takes decades.

gene  products.  This  activating  mutational  event  occurs  in  a  single 
allele.  In  contrast,  the  normal  function  of  tumor-suppressor  genes 
is  usually  to  restrain  cell  growth,  and  this  function  is  lost  in  cancer. 
Because  of  the  diploid  nature  of  mammalian  cells,  both  alleles  must 
be  inactivated  for  a  cell  to  completely  lose  the  function  of  a  tumor- 
suppressor  gene.  Thus,  it  requires  two  genetic  events  to  inactivate 
a  tumor-suppressor  gene  mutation,  while  only  one  genetic  event  is 
required to activate an oncogene.

A subset of tumor-suppressor genes controls the ability of the cell 
to maintain the integrity of its genome. Cells with a deficiency in these 
genes  acquire  an  increased  number  of  mutations  throughout  their 
genomes, including those in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. 
This  “mutator”  phenotype  was  first  hypothesized  by  Loeb  to  explain 
how the multiple rare mutational events required for tumorigenesis can 
occur in the lifetime of an individual. A mutator phenotype underlies 
several forms of cancer, such as those associated with deficiencies in 
DNA  mismatch  repair.  The  great  majority  of  cancers  do  not  har-
bor  repair  deficiencies,  and  their  rate  of  mutation  is  similar  to  that 
observed  in  normal  cells.  Many  of  these  cancers,  however,  appear  to 
harbor a different kind of genetic instability, affecting the loss or gains 
of  whole  chromosomes  or  large  parts  thereof  (as  explained  in  more 
detail below).

ONCOGENES IN HUMAN CANCER
Work by Peyton Rous in the early 1900s revealed that a chicken sar-
coma could be transmitted from animal to animal in cell-free extracts, 
suggesting that cancer could be induced by an agent acting positively 
to  promote  tumor  formation.  The  agent  responsible  for  the  trans-
mission  of  the  cancer  was  a  retrovirus  (Rous  sarcoma  virus  [RSV]), 
and the oncogene responsible was identified 75 years later as V-SRC. 
Other  oncogenes  were  also  discovered  through  their  presence  in  the 
genomes of retroviruses that are capable of causing cancers in chick-
ens, mice, and rats. The nonmutated cellular homologues of these viral 
genes  are  called  proto-oncogenes  and  are  often  targets  of  mutation 
or  aberrant  regulation  in  human  cancer.  Whereas  many  oncogenes 
were  discovered  on  the  basis  of  their  presence  in  retroviruses,  other 
oncogenes,  particularly  those  involved  in  translocations  characteris-
tic  of  particular  leukemias  and  lymphomas,  were  identified  through 
genomic approaches. Investigators cloned the sequences surrounding 
the  chromosomal  translocations  observed  cytogenetically  and  identi-
fied the genes activated at the breakpoints (see below). Some of these 
were  oncogenes  previously  found  in  retroviruses  (like  ABL,  involved 
in  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  [CML]),  whereas  others  were  new  (like 
BCL2, involved in B-cell lymphoma). In the normal cellular environ-
ment,  proto-oncogenes  have  crucial  roles  in  cell  proliferation  and 

We now know the precise nature of the genetic 
alterations responsible for nearly all malignancies 
and are beginning to understand how these altera-
tions promote the distinct stages of tumor growth. 
The prototypical example is colon cancer, in which 
analyses  of  genomes  from  the  entire  spectrum 
of  neoplastic  growths—from  normal  colon  epi-
thelium  through  adenoma  to  carcinoma—have 
identified mutations that are highly characteristic 
of each type of lesion (Fig. 71-2).

TWO TYPES OF CANCER 
GENES: ONCOGENES AND 
TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENES
Oncogenes  and  tumor-suppressor  genes  exert 
their effects on tumor growth through their ability 
to determine cell fates, influence cell survival, and 
contribute  to  genome  maintenance.  The  under-
lying  molecular  mechanisms  can  be  extremely 
complex. While tightly regulated in normal cells, 
oncogenes acquire mutations that typically relieve 
this  control  and  lead  to  increased  activity  of  the

differentiation.  Table 71-1  is  a  partial  list  of  oncogenes  known  to  be 
involved in human cancer.

The normal growth and differentiation of cells is controlled by growth 
factors  that  bind  to  receptors  on  the  surface  of  the  cell.  The  signals 
generated  by  the  membrane  receptors  are  transmitted  inside  the  cells 
through signaling cascades involving kinases, G proteins, and other reg-
ulatory proteins. Ultimately, these signals affect the activity of transcrip-
tion factors in the nucleus, which regulate the expression of genes crucial 
in cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell death. Oncogene prod-
ucts  function  at  critical  steps  in  these  signaling  pathways  (Chap.  72). 
Inappropriate activation of these pathways can lead to tumorigenesis.

MECHANISMS OF ONCOGENE ACTIVATION
 ■ POINT MUTATION
Point mutation (alternatively known as single nucleotide substitution) is a 
common mechanism of oncogene activation. For example, mutations in 
KRAS are present in >95% of pancreatic cancers and 40% of colon can-
cers. Activating KRAS mutations are less common in other cancer types, 
although they can occur at significant frequencies in leukemia, lung, and 
thyroid cancers. Remarkably—and in contrast to the diversity of muta-
tions found in tumor-suppressor genes—most of the activated KRAS 
alleles contain point mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61. These mutations 
lead to constitutive activation of the mutant RAS protein. The restricted 
pattern of mutations observed in oncogenes compared to that of tumor- 
suppressor  genes  reflects  the  fact  that  gain-of-function  mutations 
must  occur  at  specific  sites,  while  a  broad  variety  of  mutations  can 
lead to loss of activity. Indeed, inactivation of a gene can in theory be 
accomplished through the introduction of a stop codon anywhere in 
the coding sequence, whereas activations require precise substitutions 
at residues that can somehow lead to an increase in the activity of the 
encoded protein under particular circumstances within the cell.

 ■ DNA AMPLIFICATION
The second mechanism for activation of oncogenes is DNA sequence 
amplification,  leading  to  overexpression  of  the  gene  product.  This 
increase  in  DNA  copy  number  may  cause  cytologically  recognizable 
chromosome  alterations  referred  to  as  homogeneous  staining  regions 
(HSRs) if integrated within chromosomes, or double minutes (dmins) 
if extrachromosomal. With microarray and DNA sequencing technol-
ogies, the entire genome can be surveyed for gains and losses of DNA 
sequences,  thus  pinpointing  chromosomal  regions  likely  to  contain 
genes important in the development or progression of cancer.

Numerous  genes  have  been  reported  to  be  amplified  in  cancer. 
Several  of  these  genes,  including  NMYC  and  LMYC,  were  identified

through  their  presence  within  the  amplified 
DNA sequences of a tumor and their homol-
ogy  to  known  oncogenes.  Because  amplified 
regions  often  include  hundreds  of  thousands 
of  base  pairs,  multiple  oncogenes  may  be 
amplified  in  a  single  amplicon  in  some  can-
cers.  For  example,  MDM2,  GLI1,  CDK4,  and 
TPSPAN31  at  chromosomal  location  12q13-
15  have  been  shown  to  be  co-amplified  in 
several  types  of  sarcomas  and  other  tumors; 
which  of  these  genes  play  the  causal  role  in 
the  neoplastic  process  is  still  an  active  area 
of  research.  Amplification  of  a  cellular  gene 
is  often  a  predictor  of  poor  prognosis;  for 
example,  ERBB2/HER2  and  NMYC  are  often 
amplified  in  aggressive  breast  cancers  and 
neuroblastoma, respectively.
 ■ CHROMOSOMAL 
REARRANGEMENT
Chromosomal  alterations  provide  important 
clues  to  the  genetic  changes  in  cancer.  The 
chromosomal  alterations  in  human  solid 
tumors such as carcinomas are heterogeneous 
and complex and occur as a result of the frequent chromosomal insta-
bility observed in these tumors (see below). In contrast, the chromo-
some  alterations  in  myeloid  and  lymphoid  tumors  are  often  simple 
translocations, that is, reciprocal transfers of chromosome arms from 
one  chromosome  to  another.  The  breakpoints  of  recurring  chromo-
some  abnormalities  usually  occur  at  the  site  of  cellular  oncogenes. 
Table  71-2  lists  representative  examples  of  recurring  chromosome 
alterations  in  malignancy  and  the  associated  gene(s)  rearranged 
or  deregulated  by  the  chromosomal  rearrangement.  Translocations 
are  often  observed  in  liquid  tumors  in  general  and  are  particularly 
common in lymphoid tumors, probably because these cell types have 
the  capability  to  rearrange  their  DNA  to  generate  antigen  recep-
tors.  Indeed,  antigen  receptor  genes  are  commonly  involved  in  the 
translocations, implying that an imperfect regulation of receptor gene 
rearrangement  may  be  involved  in  their  pathogenesis.  In  addition  to 
transcription factors and signal transduction molecules, translocation 
may  result  in  the  overexpression  of  cell  cycle  regulatory  proteins  or 
proteins such as cyclins and of proteins that regulate cell death. Recur-
rent translocations have more recently been identified in solid tumors 
such as prostate cancers. For example, fusions between TMPRSS2 and 
ERG, which are normally located in tandem on chromosome 21, con-
tribute to more than one-third of all prostate cancers.

The first reproducible chromosome abnormality detected in human 
malignancy  was  the  Philadelphia  chromosome  detected  in  CML.

FIGURE 71-3  Specific translocation seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is derived from a reciprocal translocation between 
chromosomes 9 and 22 with the breakpoint joining the sequences of the ABL oncogene with the BCR gene. The fusion of these DNA sequences allows the generation of an 
entirely novel fusion protein with modified function.

This cytogenetic abnormality is generated by reciprocal translocation 
involving  the  ABL  oncogene  on  chromosome  9,  encoding  a  tyrosine 
kinase,  being  placed  in  proximity  to  the  breakpoint  cluster  region 
(BCR)  gene  on  chromosome  22.  Figure  71-3  illustrates  the  genera-
tion of the translocation and its protein product. The consequence of 
expression  of  the  BCR-ABL  gene  product  is  the  activation  of  signal 
transduction pathways leading to cell growth independent of normal 
external signals. Imatinib (marketed as Gleevec), a drug that specifi-
cally blocks the activity of Abl tyrosine kinase, has shown remarkable 
efficacy with little toxicity in patients with CML. The successful target-
ing of BCR-ABL by imatinib is the paradigm for molecularly targeted 
anticancer therapies.

CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY IN SOLID 
TUMORS
Solid tumors generally contain an abnormal number of chromosomes, 
a  state  known  as  aneuploidy;  chromosomes  from  aneuploid  tumors 
exhibit  structural  alterations  such  as  translocations,  deletions,  and 
amplifications.  These  abnormalities  reflect  an  underlying  defect  in 
cancer  cells  known  as  chromosomal  instability.  While  aneuploidy  is 
a  striking  cellular  phenotype,  chromosomal  instability  is  manifest  as 
only a small increase in the tendency of cells to gain, lose, or rearrange 
chromosomes  during  any  given  cell  cycle.  This  intrinsically  low  rate 
of chromosome aberration implies that cancer cells become aneuploid 
only after many generations of clonal expansion. The molecular basis 
of aneuploidy remains incompletely understood. It is widely believed 
that defects in checkpoints, the quality-control mechanisms that halt 
the cell cycle if chromosomes are damaged or misaligned, contribute 
to  chromosomal  instability.  This  hypothesis  emerged  from  experi-
mental  observations  that  the  tumor  suppressor  p53  controls  check-
points that regulate the initiation of DNA replication and the onset of 
mitosis. These processes are therefore defective in many cancer cells. 
The  mitotic  spindle  checkpoint,  which  ensures  proper  chromosome 
attachment to the mitotic spindle before allowing the sister chromatids 
to separate, is also altered in some cancers, irrespective of p53 status. 
The  precise  relationship  between  checkpoint  deficiency,  p53,  and 
chromosomal instability remains unclear, but it is believed that even a 
subtle perturbation of the highly orchestrated process of cell division 
can impact the ability of a cell to faithfully replicate and segregate its 
complement  of  chromosomes.  From  a  therapeutic  standpoint,  the 
checkpoint defects that are prevalent in cancers have been proposed as 

vulnerabilities that may be exploited by novel agents and combinatorial 
strategies.

In contrast to the genome-wide cytogenetic changes that are typical 
indications of an underlying chromosomal instability, more focal pat-
terns of chromosomal rearrangement have been recurrently detected in 
several cancer types. A curious phenomenon known as chromothripsis 
causes dozens of distinct breakpoints that are localized on one or sev-
eral  chromosomes.  These  striking  structural  alterations  are  thought 
to  reflect  a  single  event  in  which  a  chromosome  is  fragmented  and 
then imprecisely reassembled. While the exact process that underlies 
chromothripsis remains obscure and its effects on driver genes are not 
yet  clear,  a  transient  period  of  extreme  instability  stands  in  contrast 
to the gradual loss, gain, and rearrangement of chromosomes that are 
typically observed in serially cultured cancer cells.

TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE INACTIVATION 
IN CANCER
The  first  functional  evidence  for  tumor-suppressor  genes  came  from 
experiments  showing  that  fusion  of  mouse  cancer  cells  with  normal 
mouse fibroblasts led to a nontumorigenic phenotype in the fused cells. 
The normal role of tumor-suppressor genes is to restrain cell growth, 
and  the  function  of  these  genes  is  inactivated  in  cancer.  The  three 
major  types  of  somatic  lesions  observed  in  tumor-suppressor  genes 
during tumor development are point mutations, small insertions and/or 
deletions known as indels, and large deletions. Point mutations or indels 
in the coding region of tumor-suppressor genes will frequently lead to 
truncated protein products or allele-specific loss of RNA expression by 
the  process  of  nonsense-mediated  decay.  Unlike  the  highly  recurrent 
point mutations that are found in critical positions of activated onco-
genes,  known  as  mutational  hotspots,  the  point  mutations  that  cause 
tumor-suppressor gene inactivation tend to be distributed throughout 
the open reading frame. Large deletions lead to the loss of a functional 
product and sometimes encompass the entire gene or even the entire 
chromosome arm, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor 
DNA compared to the corresponding normal tissue DNA (Fig. 71-4). 
LOH in tumor DNA often indicates the presence of a tumor-suppressor 
gene at a particular chromosomal location, and LOH studies have been 
useful in the positional cloning of many tumor-suppressor genes. The 
rate of LOH is increased in the presence of chromosomal instability, a 
relationship that would explain the selective forces leading to the high 
prevalence of aneuploidy in late-stage cancers.

FIGURE 71-4  Diagram of possible mechanisms for tumor formation in an individual with hereditary (familial) retinoblastoma. On the left is shown the pedigree of an 
affected individual who has inherited the abnormal (Rb) allele from her affected mother. The normal allele is shown as a (+). The four chromosomes of her two parents are 
drawn to indicate their origin. Flanking the retinoblastoma locus are genetic markers (A and B) also analyzed in this family. Markers A3 and B3 are on the chromosome 
carrying the retinoblastoma disease gene. Tumor formation results when the normal allele, which this patient inherited from her father, is inactivated. On the right are shown 
four possible ways in which this could occur. In each case, the resulting chromosome 13 arrangement is shown. Note that in the first three situations, the normal allele (B1) 
has been lost in the tumor tissue, which is referred to as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at this locus.

Gene silencing, an epigenetic change that leads to the loss of gene 
expression,  occurs  in  conjunction  with  hypermethylation  of  the  pro-
moter and histone deacetylation, and is another mechanism of tumor-
suppressor  gene  inactivation.  An  epigenetic  modification  refers  to  a 
covalent modification of chromatin, heritable by cell progeny that may 
involve DNA but does not involve a change in the DNA sequence. The 
inactivation of the second X chromosome in female cells is a physio-
logic example of an epigenetic silencing that prevents gene expression 
from  the  inactivated  chromosome.  Genomic  regions  of  hypermethy-
lated  and  hypomethylated  DNA  can  be  detected  by  specialized  tech-
niques, and a subset of these regional modifications has consequences 
on the cell’s behavior.

FAMILIAL CANCER SYNDROMES
A small fraction of cancers occurs in patients with a genetic predispo-
sition. Based on studies of inherited and sporadic forms of retinoblas-
toma, Knudson and others formulated a hypothesis that explains the 
differences between sporadic and inherited forms of the same tumor 
type.  In  inherited  forms  of  cancer,  called  cancer  predisposition  syn-
dromes,  one  allele  of  a  particular  tumor-suppressor  gene  is  inherited 
in mutant form. This germline mutation is not sufficient to initiate a 
tumor, however; the other allele, inherited from the unaffected parent, 
must  become  somatically  inactivated  in  a  normal  stem  cell  for  tum-
origenesis to be initiated. In sporadic (noninherited) forms of the same 
disease,  all  cells  in  the  body  start  out  with  two  normal  copies  of  the 
tumor-suppressor  gene.  A  single  cell  must  then  sequentially  acquire 
mutations  in  both  alleles  of  the  tumor-suppressor  gene  to  initiate  a 
tumor. Thus, biallelic mutations of the same tumor-suppressor gene are 
required for both inherited and noninherited forms of the disease; the 
only difference is that individuals with the inherited form have a “head 
start”: they already have one allele mutated, from conception, and only 
need one additional mutation to initiate the process (Fig. 71-4).

This  distinction  explains  why  those  with  inherited  forms  of  the 
disease develop more cancers, at an earlier age, than the general popu-
lation. It also explains why, even though every cell in an individual with 
a cancer predisposition syndrome has a mutant gene, only a relatively 
small number of tumors arise during his or her lifetime. The reason is 
that the vast majority of cells within such individuals are functionally 
normal  because  one  of  the  two  alleles  of  the  tumor-suppressor  gene 
is  normal.  Mutations  are  uncommon  events,  and  only  the  rare  cells 
that  develop  a  mutation  in  the  remaining  normal  allele  will  exhibit 
uncontrolled proliferation. The same principle applies to virtually all 
types of cancer predisposition syndromes, though the particular genes 
differ. For example, inherited mutations in RB1, WT1, VHL, APC, and 
BRCA1  lead  to  predispositions  to  retinoblastomas,  Wilms’  tumors, 
renal  cell  carcinomas,  colorectal  carcinomas,  and  breast  carcinomas, 
respectively  (Table  71-3).  Also  note  that  the  biallelic  inactivation  of 
any of these genes is not sufficient to develop cancer; it requires other, 
additional somatic alterations in other genes for the initiating cells to 
evolve to malignancy, as noted above.

Roughly  100  familial  cancer  syndromes  have  been  reported;  the 
great  majority  are  very  rare.  Most  of  these  syndromes  exhibit  an 
autosomal  dominant  pattern  of  inheritance,  although  some  of  those 
associated with DNA repair abnormalities (xeroderma pigmentosum, 
Fanconi’s anemia, ataxia telangiectasia) are inherited in an autosomal 
recessive fashion. Table 71-3 shows a number of cancer predisposition 
syndromes and the responsible genes.

The next section examines inherited colon cancer predispositions in 
detail because several lessons of general importance have been derived 
from the study of these syndromes.

Familial  adenomatous  polyposis  (FAP)  is  a  dominantly  inherited 
colon cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations in the adenoma-
tous  polyposis  coli  (APC)  tumor-suppressor  gene  on  chromosome  5. 
Affected  individuals  develop  hundreds  to  thousands  of  adenomas  in

the  colon.  In  each  of  these  adenomas,  the  APC  allele  inherited  from 
the affected parent has been inactivated by virtue of a somatic mutation 
(Fig. 71-2). This inactivation usually occurs through a gross chromo-
somal event resulting in loss of all or a large part of the long arm of 
chromosome 5, where APC resides. In other cases, the remaining allele 
is inactivated by a subtle intragenic mutation of APC, which is typically 
a single base substitution resulting in a nonsense codon. Gross chro-
mosomal losses occur more commonly than point mutations in normal 
cells, explaining why chromosomal loss rather than point mutation is 
the predominant mechanism underlying the inactivation of the normal 
allele  of  APC.  The  same  is  true  for  other  cancer  predisposition  syn-
dromes  caused  by  other  inherited  tumor  suppressor  gene  mutations; 
gross  chromosomal  events  are  generally  responsible  for  inactivation 
of  the  tumor-suppressor  gene  allele  inherited  from  the  nonaffected 
parent. Several thousand adenomas form in FAP patients, and a small 
subset of the millions of cells within an adenoma will acquire a second 
mutation, leading to tumor progression, that is, a larger adenoma. A 
third mutation in such a larger adenoma may convert it to a carcinoma. 
If untreated (by colectomy), at least one of the adenomas will progress 
to cancer by the time patients are in their mid-40s. APC can be consid-
ered to be a gatekeeper for colon tumorigenesis in that in the absence of 
mutation of this gatekeeper (or a gene acting within the same pathway), 
a colorectal tumor simply cannot be initiated. Figure 71-5 shows the 
germline  and  somatic  mutations  found  in  the  APC  gene.  A  negative 
regulator of a signaling pathway that determines cell fate during devel-
opment, the APC protein provides differentiation and apoptotic cues 

to colonic epithelial cells as they migrate up the crypt. Defects in this 
process can lead to abnormal accumulation of cells that would other-
wise differentiate and eventually undergo apoptosis.

In contrast to patients with FAP, patients with hereditary nonpoly-
posis  colon  cancer  (HNPCC,  or  Lynch’s  syndrome)  do  not  develop 
polyposis, but instead develop only one or a small number of adenomas 
that rapidly progress to cancer. HNPCC is due to inherited mutations 
in one of four DNA mismatch repair genes (Table 71-3) that are com-
ponents of a repair system responsible for correcting errors in newly 
replicated DNA. Germline mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 account for 
more than 90% of HNPCC cases, and mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 
account  for  the  remainder.  When  a  somatic  mutation  inactivates  the 
remaining wild-type allele of a mismatch repair gene, the cell develops 
a hypermutable phenotype characterized by profound genomic insta-
bility that is most readily apparent in short repeated sequences called 
microsatellites and is sometimes called microsatellite instability (MSI). 
The  high  rate  of  mutation  in  such  cells  impacts  all  genes,  including 
oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressor  genes,  and  thereby  accelerates  the 
activation of the former and the inactivation of the latter (Fig. 71-2). 
HNPCC  can  be  considered  a  disease  of  tumor  progression;  once 
tumors are initiated (by an inactivating mutation of APC or by some 
other gene in the APC pathway), tumors rapidly progress because of 
the  accelerated  mutation  rate.  Progression  from  a  tiny  adenoma  to 
carcinoma  takes  only  a  few  years  in  HNPCC  patients  instead  of  the 
two  or  three  decades  this  progression  takes  in  patients  with  FAP  (or 
in  patients  with  sporadic  colorectal  tumors).  Approximately  half  of

FIGURE 71-5  Germline and somatic mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). APC encodes a 2843-amino-acid protein with six major 
domains: an oligomerization region (O), armadillo repeats (ARM), 15-amino-acid repeats (15 aa), 20-amino-acid repeats (20 aa), a basic region, and a domain involved in 
binding EB1 and the Drosophila discs large homologue (E/D). Shown are 650 somatic and 826 germline mutations representative of the mutations that occur within the APC 
gene (from the APC database at www.umd.be/APC). All known pathogenic mutations of APC result in the truncation of the APC protein. Germline mutations are found to 
be relatively evenly distributed up to codon 1600 except for two mutation hotspots surrounding amino acids 1061 and 1309, which together account for one-third of the 
mutations found in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) families.

HNPCC  patients  develop  colorectal  cancers  by  the  time  they  are  in 
their  mid-40s—similar  to  that  of  FAP  patients.  This  coincidence  in 
age of onset emphasizes that both tumor initiation (abnormal in FAP 
patients)  and  tumor  progression  (abnormal  in  HNPCC  patients)  are 
the  two  pillars  of  cancer  development  and  are  equally  important  for 
cancer development.

Another  general  principle  is  apparent  from  the  comparison 
between FAP and HNPCC patients. The tumors in FAP patients, like 
those in patients without hereditary predisposition to cancers, exhibit 
chromosomal  instability  rather  than  MSI.  Indeed,  MSI  and  chro-
mosomal  instability  tend  to  be  mutually  exclusive  in  colon  cancers, 
suggesting  that  they  represent  alternative  mechanisms  for  the  gen-
eration  of  genomic  instability  (Fig.  71-2).  Other  cancer  types  rarely 
exhibit MSI. Chromosomal instability is far more prevalent than MSI 
among all cancer types, perhaps explaining why nearly all cancers are  
aneuploid.

Although most autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndromes are 
due to mutations in tumor-suppressor genes (Table 71-3), there are a few 
interesting exceptions. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, a dominant 
disorder  characterized  by  pituitary  adenomas,  medullary  carcinoma 
of the thyroid, and (in some pedigrees) pheochromocytoma, is due to 
gain-of-function mutations in the proto-oncogene RET on chromosome 
10. Similarly, gain-of-function mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain 
of  the  MET  oncogene  lead  to  hereditary  papillary  renal  carcinoma. 
Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in the RET gene cause a com-
pletely different disease, Hirschsprung’s disease (aganglionic megacolon 
[Chaps. 328 and 388]).

Although the heritable forms of cancer have taught us much about 
the mechanisms of growth control, most forms of cancer do not follow 
simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance. The majority of human can-
cers arise in a sporadic fashion, solely as a result of somatic mutation, 
and in the absence of any mutations in cancer-predisposing genes in 
their germlines.

GENETIC TESTING FOR FAMILIAL CANCER
The  discovery  of  cancer  susceptibility  genes  raises  the  possibility  of 
DNA  testing  to  predict  the  risk  of  cancer  in  individuals  of  affected 
families. An algorithm for cancer risk assessment and decision making 

in high-risk families using genetic testing is shown in Fig. 71-6. Once 
a mutation is discovered in a family, subsequent testing of asymptom-
atic family members can be crucial in patient management. A negative 
gene test in these individuals can prevent years of anxiety, providing 
comfort in the knowledge that their cancer risk is no higher than that 
of the general population. On the other hand, a positive test may lead to 
alteration of clinical management, such as increased frequency of can-
cer screening and, when feasible and appropriate, prophylactic surgery. 
Potential negative consequences of a positive test result include psycho-
logical distress (anxiety, depression) and discrimination, although the 
Genetic  Information  Nondiscrimination  Act  (GINA)  makes  it  illegal 
for predictive genetic information to be used to discriminate in health 
insurance or employment. Testing should therefore not be conducted 
without counseling before testing is administered and during and after 
disclosure of the test result.

It  is  now  feasible  to  obtain  high-quality  sequence  of  all  of  the  
protein-coding  DNA  sequences,  and  even  of  the  entire  genome,  in 
any  given  individual.  In  such  studies,  numerous  variants  in  DNA 
sequences  will  inevitably  be  identified  in  every  subject,  but  the  sig-
nificance of the vast majority of these DNA sequence findings will be 
unclear. Even mutations in tumor-suppressor genes will be difficult to 
interpret unless there is an obvious functional implication, such as the 
truncation of the open reading frame, or that particular mutation has 
previously been correlated with cancer in other individuals. Germline 
mutations  associated  with  cancer  predisposition  are  uncommon  in 
individuals without a family history of cancer, though they do occur. 
Much more common are variants of unknown significance (VUS). VUS 
that  are  found  during  genetic  testing  cannot  be  used  to  evaluate  the 
relative risk of cancer but may nonetheless cause anxiety because they 
represent  a  deviation  from  the  reference  allele  that  is  established  as 
“normal.” Because of the low yield of informative mutations that mod-
ify  cancer  risk  and  the  frequent  identification  of  VUS,  it  is  generally 
not appropriate to use DNA sequencing to assess cancer risk in indi-
viduals without a family history of cancer. However, there are excep-
tions: testing may be appropriate in some subpopulations with a known 
increased risk, even without a personal family history. For example, two 
mutations  in  the  breast  cancer  susceptibility  gene  BRCA1,  185delAG 
and 5382insC, exhibit a sufficiently high frequency in the Ashkenazi

The key step is the identification of a disease mutation in a cancer patient, which 
is  an  indication  for  the  testing  of  asymptomatic  family  members.  Asymptomatic 
family  members  who  test  positive  may  require  increased  screening  or  surgery, 
whereas those who test negative are at no greater risk for cancer than the general 
population. It should be emphasized that no molecular assay used for this sort of 
testing is 100% sensitive; negative results must be interpreted with this caveat in 
mind.

Jewish  population  that  genetic  testing  based  on  ethnicity  alone  may 
be warranted.

It is important that genetic test results be communicated to families 
by trained genetic counselors. To ensure that the families clearly under-
stand its advantages and disadvantages and the impact it may have on 
disease management and psyche, genetic testing should never be done 
before counseling. Significant expertise is needed to communicate the 
results of genetic testing to families.

 ■ CANCER GENOMES
The  advent  of  relatively  inexpensive  technologies  for  rapid  and 
high-throughput  DNA  sequencing  has  facilitated  the  comprehensive 
analysis  of  numerous  genomes  from  many  types  of  tumors.  This 
unprecedented  view  into  the  genetic  nature  of  cancer  has  provided 
remarkable  insights.  Most  cancers  do  not  arise  in  the  context  of  a 
mutator phenotype, and accordingly, the number of mutations in even 
the most advanced cancers is relatively modest. Common solid tumors 
harbor  30–70  subtle  mutations  that  are  nonsynonymous  (i.e.,  result 
in an amino acid change in the encoded protein). Liquid tumors such 
as leukemias, as well as pediatric tumors, typically have fewer than 20 
mutations. The vast majority of the mutations detected in tumors are 
not functionally significant; they simply arose by chance in a single cell 
that gave rise to an expanding clone. Such mutations, which provide 
no  selective  advantage  to  the  cell  in  which  they  occur,  are  known  as 
passenger mutations. As noted above, only a small number of the muta-
tions  confer  a  selective  growth  advantage  and  thereby  promote  tum-
origenesis. These functional mutations are known as driver mutations, 
and the genes in which they occur are called driver genes.

The frequency and distribution of driver mutations within a single 
tumor type can be represented as a topographical landscape. The pic-
ture that emerges from these studies reveals that most genes that are 
mutated in tumors are actually mutated at relatively low frequencies, 
as would be expected of passenger genes, whereas a small number of 
genes (the driver genes) are mutated in a large proportion of tumors. 
It  appears  that  there  are  only  a  total  of  ~120  bona  fide  driver  genes 
contributing to the development of solid tumors of all kinds, though 
other  driver  genes  that  play  a  role  in  a  small  fraction  of  cancers  are 
still  being  discovered.  The  majority  of  the  mutations  in  driver  genes 
provide  a  direct  selective  growth  advantage  by  altering  the  signaling 
pathways  that  mediate  cell  survival  or  the  determination  of  cell  fate. 
The  remaining  driver  gene  mutations  indirectly  provide  a  selective 
growth advantage by accelerating the mutation rate of proto-oncogenes 
and tumor-suppressor genes. That the same driver genes play a role in 
multiple cancer types was unexpected before their discovery and has 
important implications for the development of new “tumor-agnostic” 
therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. Moreover, the functions of all 
these driver genes can be organized into a small number of signaling 
pathways, as shown in Table 71-4.

As a consequence of the mutations they harbor, cancer cells invari-
ably express mutant proteins that are only rarely found in normal cells. 
Some  of  these  mutant  proteins  are  processed  and  displayed  on  the 
cell  surface  in  the  context  of  major  histocompatibility  complexes,  a 
process that would normally facilitate their recognition by the adaptive 
immune  system.  Thus,  all  cancers  have  the  theoretical  potential  to 
be recognized as foreign, or “nonself,” via the display of these tumor- 
specific antigens, known as mutation-associated neoantigens (MANAs). 
In  fact,  established  tumors  invariably  prevent  the  activation  of  local

include Burkitt’s lymphoma (Epstein-Barr virus; Chap. 194), hepato-
cellular  carcinoma  (hepatitis  viruses),  cervical  cancer  (human  papil-
lomavirus  [HPV];  Chap.  198),  and  T-cell  leukemia  (retroviruses; 
Chap.  201).  There  are  several  types  of  HPV,  including  the  high-risk 
types 16 and 18 that are strongly associated with the development of 
cervical,  vulvar,  vaginal,  penile,  anal,  and  oropharyngeal  cancer.  The 
mechanisms of action of all these viruses involve inactivation of tumor-
suppressor genes. For example, HPV proteins E6 and E7 bind to and 
inactivate cellular tumor suppressors p53 and pRB, respectively. This is 
the reason that HPV is such a potent initiator of cancer: infection with 
a virus is tantamount to having two of the three mutant driver genes 
required for cancer, that is, one viral oncogene inactivates p53 and the 
other inactivates Rb. Once these two inactivated gene products initiate 
tumorigenesis, only one additional mutant gene is required for these 
tumors to progress to malignancy.

506 T cells by inducing an intercellular suppressive mechanism known as 
an immune checkpoint. Therapeutic approaches to exploit this potential 
vulnerability  by  blocking  immune  checkpoints  have  elicited  striking 
responses in patients with several types of cancer.

It was hypothesized that the potential immunogenicity of a tumor 
would be related to the total number of distinctive neoantigens it can 
express, which in turn is directly determined by the total number of 
mutations in the cancer genome. This does seem to be the case. Col-
orectal cancers that develop as a result of mismatch repair deficiency 
and  smoking-related  lung  cancers,  both  of  which  characteristically 
harbor  large  numbers  of  mutations,  exhibit  more  robust  responses 
to  therapeutic  immune  checkpoint  blockade  than  most  other  tumor 
types.  Notably,  driver  mutations  as  well  as  passenger  mutations  that 
result in the expression of mutant proteins can both contribute to the 
display of immunogenic neoantigens. Thus, the total number of coding 
mutations, a metric known as mutational load, is one of the determi-
nants of potential immunogenicity.

 ■ TUMOR HETEROGENEITY
The  mutant  cells  that  compose  a  single  tumor  are  not  genetically 
identical.  Rather,  cells  obtained  from  different  sites  on  a  tumor  will 
harbor common mutations as well as mutations that are unique to each 
sample. Genetic heterogeneity results from the ongoing acquisition of 
mutations  during  tumor  growth.  Each  time  a  genome  is  replicated, 
there is a small but quantifiable probability that a mutation will spon-
taneously arise as a result of a replication error and be passed on to the 
cellular progeny. This is true in normal cells or in tumor cells. Any ran-
domly chosen cell from the skin of one individual will harbor hundreds 
of genetic alterations that distinguish it from a different randomly cho-
sen skin cell, and the same is true for all organs of self-renewing tissues. 
Tumors are actually less genetically heterogeneous than normal tissues; 
any two randomly chosen cells from a tumor of an individual will have 
fewer differences than any two randomly chosen cells from that indi-
vidual’s normal tissues. The reason for this decrease in heterogeneity is 

clonal expansion, the fundamental feature of tumorigenesis. Every time 
a clonal expansion occurs, a genetic bottleneck wipes out heterogeneity 
among the cells that did not expand; these unexpanded cells either die 
or form only a minute proportion of the total cells in the expanding 
tumor.

The mutations that vary between cells of a given tumor are invari-
ably passenger mutations that arose since the last evolutionary bottle-
neck, that is, those mutations that arose during the expansion of the 
founder  cell  that  gave  rise  to  the  final  clonal  expansion.  In  contrast, 
the passenger mutations that were present in the founder cell will be 
uniformly present in every cell in the tumor. In that respect, these pas-
senger  mutations  are  not  heterogeneously  distributed  and  are  in  fact 
uniformly present in virtually all cancer cells. These “clonal” mutations, 
i.e., present in all cells of the cancers, are the main source of MANAs 
that  can  be  exploited  through  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors.  The 
total  number  of  mutations  and  their  distribution  within  tumor  cells 
represent a complex interplay between the age of the patient (the older 
the patient, the more passenger mutations will have accumulated in the 
founding cell of the first clonal expansion) and the evolutionary history 
of the cancer (its age and number of clonal expansions it experienced).
Tumor heterogeneity has been recognized for decades at the cyto-
genetic,  biochemical,  and  histopathologic  levels.  However,  it  is  only 
recently, with the advent of a deep understanding of cancer genetics, 
that  genetic  heterogeneity  can  be  interpreted  in  a  medically  relevant 
fashion.  The  first  important  point  to  recognize  about  tumor  hetero-
geneity  is  that  it  is  only  the  variation  in  driver  gene  alterations  that 
is  important;  the  cellular  distribution  of  passenger  gene  mutations  is 
irrelevant except for immune-related phenomena. In this discussion of 
heterogeneity, we can expand the definition of “driver genes” to include 
those that provide a selective growth advantage in the face of therapy 
in addition to those that provide a selective growth advantage during 
tumor evolution, prior to treatment.

Type I heterogeneity refers to that among tumors of the same type 
from different patients (Fig. 71-7). Though adenocarcinomas of the

lung  generally  harbor  mutations  in  three  or  more  driver  genes,  the 
genes differ among the patients, and the precise mutations within the 
same  gene  can  vary  considerably.  Type  I  heterogeneity  is  the  basis 
for precision medicine, where the goal is to treat patients with drugs 
that  target  the  proteins  encoded  by  genetic  alterations  within  their 
specific  tumors.  Type  II  heterogeneity  refers  to  the  genetic  hetero-
geneity among different cells from the same primary tumor. Tumors 
continue to evolve as they grow, and different cells of the same cancer, 
in its original site (e.g., the pancreas), may acquire other driver gene 
mutations  that  are  not  shared  among  the  other  cells  of  the  tumor. 
Such a mutation can result in a small clonal expansion that may or 
may  not  be  important  biologically.  In  cases  in  which  the  primary 
tumor  can  be  surgically  excised,  such  mutations  are  unimportant 
unless  they  give  rise  to  type  III  heterogeneity  (described  below). 
The reason they are unimportant is because all primary tumor cells, 
whether homogeneous or not, are removed by the surgical procedure. 
In primary tumors that cannot be completely excised (such as most 
advanced  brain  tumors  and  many  pancreatic  ductal  adenocarcino-
mas),  heterogeneity  is  biomedically  important  because  it  can  give 
rise  to  drug  resistance,  analogously  to  that  described  for  type  IV 
heterogeneity (see below). Type III heterogeneity refers to the genetic 
differences among the founder cells of the metastatic lesions from the 
same  patient.  For  example,  a  patient  with  melanoma  may  have  100 
different  metastases  distributed  throughout  various  organs.  Only  if 
a mutant BRAF is present in every founder cell of every metastasis, 
then the patient has a chance at a complete response to a BRAF inhib-
itor. There have been several recent detailed studies of the metastases 
from various tumor types. Fortunately, these studies suggest there is 
very  little,  if  any,  type  III  heterogeneity  among  driver  genes,  a  nec-
essary prerequisite for the successful implementation of current and 
future targeted therapies. Finally, type IV heterogeneity refers to that 
among  cells  of  individual  metastatic  lesions.  As  the  founder  cell  of 
each metastasis expands to become detectable, it acquires mutations, 
a  small  number  of  which  can  act  as  “drivers”  when  the  patient  is 
exposed to therapeutics. This type of heterogeneity is of major clinical 
importance, as it has been shown to be responsible for the develop-
ment of resistance in virtually all targeted therapies. The development 
of such resistance is a fait accompli based simply on known mutation 
rates and genetic resistance mechanisms. The only way to circumvent 
acquired resistance is to treat metastatic tumors earlier (i.e., in adju-
vant setting, before much tumor expansion has occurred) or to treat 
with combinations of drugs for which cross-resistance is genetically  
impossible.

PERSONALIZED CANCER DETECTION AND 
TREATMENT
High-throughput DNA sequencing has led to an unprecedented under-
standing of cancer at the molecular level. A comprehensive mutation 
profile provides a molecular history of a given tumor and insights into 
how  it  arose.  Because  tumor  cells  and  tumor  DNA  are  shed  into  the 
blood and other bodily fluids, common driver mutations can be used as 
highly specific biomarkers for early detection. For diagnosed tumors, 
tumor-specific mutations can be used to estimate tumor burden, assess 
treatment responses, and detect recurrence.

In some cases, information regarding specific genes and pathways 
that  are  altered  provides  patients  and  physicians  with  options  for 
personalized  therapy.  This  general  approach  is  sometimes  referred 
to  as  precision  medicine.  Because  tumor  behavior  is  highly  variable, 
even  within  a  tumor  type,  personalized  information-based  medicine 
can  supplement  and  perhaps  eventually  supplant  histology-based 
tumor assessment, especially in the case of tumors that are resistant to 
conventional therapeutic approaches. Conversely, molecular nosology 
has  revealed  similarities  in  tumors  of  diverse  histotype.  The  success 

of  the  precision  medicine  approach  in  any  given  patient  depends  on 
the  presence  of  tumor-associated  genetic  alterations  that  are  action-
able (i.e., can be targeted with a specific drug). Examples of currently 
actionable changes include mutations in BRAF (targeted by the drug 
vemurafenib),  RET  (targeted  by  sunitinib  and  sorafenib),  ALK  rear-
rangements (targeted by crizotinib), and mismatch repair genes (tar-
getable by immune checkpoint inhibitors). At present, the proportion 
of tumors that can be treated with such precision medicine approaches 
is  relatively  small,  but  future  therapeutic  development  will  hopefully 
change  this  situation.  The  development  of  new  targeted  agents  is  at 
present  hindered  by  the  fact  that  most  such  agents  can  only  target 
activated  oncogenes,  while  the  great  majority  of  genetic  alterations 
in  common  solid  tumors  are  those  that  inactivate  tumor-suppressor 
genes.  Because  all  drugs,  whether  for  use  in  oncology  or  any  other 
purpose,  can  only  inhibit  protein  actions,  drugs  cannot  be  used  to 
directly  target  the  proteins  encoded  by  inactivated  tumor-suppressor 
genes; these proteins are already inactive. More information about the 
pathways  through  which  tumor-suppressor  genes  act  may  provide  a 
way around this obstacle. For example, when a tumor-suppressor gene 
is inactivated, some downstream component of the pathway is likely to 
be activated, thereby presenting a realistic target. An example of this 
is provided by PARP-1 inhibitors, which have been successfully used 
to  treat  patients  whose  tumors  have  inactivating  mutations  of  genes 
involved in DNA repair processes, such as BRCA1. Patterns of global 
gene  expression  can  be  used  to  help  unravel  such  pathways  and  are 
already being used to predict drug sensitivities and provide prognostic 
information  in  addition  to  that  provided  by  DNA  sequence  analysis. 
Evaluation  of  proteomic  and  metabolomics  patterns  may  also  prove 
useful for this purpose.

 ■ THE FUTURE
A  revolution  in  cancer  genetics  has  occurred  in  the  past  30  years. 
Most types of cancer are now understood at the DNA sequence level, 
and  this  accomplishment  has  led  to  an  increasingly  refined  under-
standing of tumorigenesis. Cancer gene mutations have proven to be 
reliable  biomarkers  for  cancer  detection  and  monitoring  as  well  as 
for  informing  therapeutics  through  precision  medicine  approaches. 
Gene-based tests are already standard of care for patients with certain 
tumor types, such as melanoma and colorectal and lung cancers, and 
the utility of these tests will undoubtedly be expanded in the coming 
years as new therapies and ways of predicting responses to therapies 
are developed. While effective treatment of advanced cancers remains 
difficult,  the  early  promise  shown  by  immune-based  therapies  not-
withstanding,  it  is  expected  that  breakthroughs  in  these  areas  will 
continue to emerge and be applicable to an ever-increasing number of 
cancers. Moreover, with the hoped-for advances in diagnostics, par-
ticularly in the earlier detection of cancers, the new and old therapies 
for cancer can be expected to have a much greater impact on reducing 
cancer deaths.

 ■ CANCER CELL BIOLOGY
Cancers  are  characterized  by  unregulated  cell  division,  avoidance  of 
cell death, tissue invasion, and the ability to spread to other areas of the 
body (metastasize). A neoplasm is benign when it grows in an unreg-
ulated fashion without tissue invasion or metastasizing. The presence 
of unregulated growth, tissue invasion, and the ability to metastasize 
is  characteristic  of  malignant  neoplasms.  Cancers  are  named  based 
on their origin: those derived from epithelial tissue are called carcino-
mas, those derived from mesenchymal tissues are sarcomas, and those 
derived  from  hematopoietic  tissue  are  leukemias,  lymphomas,  and 
plasma cell dyscrasias (including multiple myeloma).

Cancers nearly always arise as a consequence of genetic alterations, 
the  vast  majority  of  which  begin  in  a  single  cell  and  therefore  are 
monoclonal in origin. However, because a wide variety of genetic and 
epigenetic changes can occur in different cells within malignant tumors 
over  time,  most  cancers  are  characterized  by  marked  heterogeneity 
in the populations of cells. In addition, extrinsic factors in the cancer 
environment  (e.g.,  the  stroma,  infiltrating  cells,  various  cell-to-cell 
interactions,  spatial  orientation,  secreted  factors,  and  availability  of 
oxygen and nutrients) vary in different areas within the tumor or dif-
ferent metastases, compounding this heterogeneity. This heterogeneity 
significantly  complicates  the  treatment  of  most  cancers  because  it  is 
likely that there are subsets of cells that will be resistant to therapy for a 
variety of reasons and will therefore survive and proliferate even if the 
majority of cells are killed.

A few cancers appear to, at least initially, be primarily driven by an 
alteration in a dominant gene that produces uncontrolled cell prolif-
eration. Examples include chronic myeloid leukemia (abl), about half 
of melanomas (braf), Burkitt’s lymphoma (c-myc), and subsets of lung 
adenocarcinomas (egfr, alk, ros1, met, ret, braf, and ntrk). Genes that 
can promote cell growth when altered are often called oncogenes. They 
were  first  identified  as  critical  elements  of  viruses  that  cause  animal 
tumors;  it  was  subsequently  found  that  the  viral  genes  had  normal 
counterparts with important functions in the cell and had been cap-
tured and mutated by viruses as they passed from host to host.

However, most human cancers are characterized by a multiple-step 
process  involving  many  genetic  abnormalities,  each  of  which  con-
tributes  to  the  loss  of  control  of  cell  proliferation  and  differentiation 
and the acquisition of capabilities, such as tissue invasion, the ability 
to  metastasize,  and  angiogenesis  (development  of  new  blood  vessels 
required  for  tumor  growth).  These  properties  are  not  found  in  the 
normal  adult  cell  from  which  the  tumor  is  derived.  Indeed,  nor-
mal  cells  have  a  large  number  of  safeguards  against  DNA  damage 
(including multiple DNA repair and extensive DNA damage response 
mechanisms), uncontrolled proliferation, and invasion. Many cancers 
go through recognizable steps of progressively more abnormal pheno-
types: hyperplasia, to adenoma, to dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ, to 
invasive cancer with the ability to metastasize (Table 72-1). For most 
cancers, these changes occur over a prolonged period of time, usually 
many years.

In most organs, only primitive undifferentiated cells are capable of 
proliferating and cells lose the capacity to proliferate as they differenti-
ate and acquire functional capabilities. The expansion of the primitive 
cells (stem cells) is linked to some functional need in the host through 
receptors that receive signals from the local environment or through 
hormonal and other influences delivered by the vascular supply. In the 
absence of such signals, the cells are at rest. The signals that keep the 
primitive cells at rest remain incompletely understood. These signals 
must be environmental, based on the observations that a regenerating 
liver  stops  growing  when  it  has  replaced  the  portion  that  has  been 
surgically  removed  after  partial  hepatectomy  and  regenerating  bone 
marrow  stops  growing  when  the  peripheral  blood  counts  return  to 

TABLE 72-1  Phenotypic Characteristics of Malignant Cells
Deregulated cell proliferation: Loss of function of negative growth regulators 
(tumor suppressor genes, i.e., Rb, p53), and increased action of positive growth 
regulators (oncogenes, i.e., Ras, Myc). Leads to aberrant cell cycle control and 
includes loss of normal checkpoint responses.
Failure to differentiate: Arrest at a stage before terminal differentiation. 
May retain stem cell properties. (Frequently observed in leukemias due to 
transcriptional repression of developmental programs by the gene products of 
chromosomal translocations.)
Loss of normal apoptosis pathways: Inactivation of p53, increases in Bcl-2 
(antiapoptotic) family members. This defect enhances the survival of cells with 
oncogenic mutations and genetic instability and allows clonal expansion and 
diversification within the tumor without activation of physiologic cell death 
pathways.
Genetic instability: Defects in DNA repair pathways leading to either single 
nucleotide or oligonucleotide mutations (as in microsatellite instability, MIN) or, 
more commonly, chromosomal instability (CIN) leading to aneuploidy (abnormal 
number of chromosomes in a cell). Caused by loss of function of a number of 
proteins including p53, BRCA1/2, mismatch repair genes, DNA repair enzymes, 
and the spindle checkpoint. Leads to accumulation of a variety of mutations in 
different cells within the tumor and heterogeneity.
Loss of replicative senescence: Normal cells stop dividing in vitro after 25–50 
population doublings. Arrest is mediated by the Rb, p16INK4a, and p53 pathways. 
While most cells remain arrested, genetic and epigenetic changes in a subset 
of cells allow further replication, leading to telomere loss, with crisis leading 
to death of many cells. Cells that survive often harbor gross chromosomal 
abnormalities and the ability to continue to proliferate. These cells express 
telomerase, which maintains telomeres and is important for ongoing growth of 
these cells. Relevance to human in vivo cancer remains uncertain. Many human 
cancers express telomerase.
Nonresponsiveness to external growth-inhibiting signals: Cancer cells have 
lost responsiveness to signals normally present to stop proliferating when they 
have overgrown the niche normally occupied by the organ from which they are 
derived. Our understanding about this mechanism of growth regulation remains 
limited.
Increased angiogenesis: Due to increased gene expression of proangiogenic 
factors (VEGF, FGF, IL-8, angiopoietin) by tumor or stromal cells, or loss of 
negative regulators (endostatin, tumstatin, thrombospondin).
Invasion: Cell mobility and ability to move through extracellular matrix and into 
other tissues or organs. Loss of cell-cell contacts (gap junctions, cadherins) and 
increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Can take the form 
of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with anchored epithelial cells 
becoming more like motile fibroblasts.
Metastasis: Spread of tumor cells to lymph nodes or distant tissue sites. Limited 
by the ability of tumor cells to migrate out of initial site and to survive in a foreign 
environment, including evading the immune system (see below).
Evasion of the immune system: Downregulation of MHC class I and II molecules; 
induction of T-cell tolerance; inhibition of normal dendritic cell and/or T-cell 
function; antigenic loss variants and clonal heterogeneity; increase in regulatory 
T cells.
Shift in cell metabolism: Complex changes including alterations due to 
tumor stress such as hypoxia and energy generation shifts from oxidative 
phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis generate building blocks for malignant cell 
production and proliferation.

Abbreviations: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; IL, interleukin; MHC, major 
histocompatibility complex; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.

normal. Cancer cells clearly have lost responsiveness to such controls 
and do not recognize when they have overgrown the niche normally 
occupied by the organ from which they are derived. A better under-
standing of these mechanisms of growth regulation in the context of 
organ homeostasis is evolving.

 ■ CANCER AS AN ORGAN THAT IGNORES ITS NICHE
The fundamental cellular defects that create a malignant neoplasm act 
at the cellular level, and some of these are cell autonomous. However, 
that is not the entire story. Cancers consist of both malignant cells as 
well  as  other  cells,  blood  vessels,  extracellular  matrix,  and  signaling 
and other molecules in the cancer microenvironment. They behave as 
organs that have lost their specialized function and stopped responding

to  signals  that  would  limit  their  growth  in  tightly  regulated  normal 
tissue  homeostasis.  Most  human  cancers  usually  become  clinically 
detectable when a primary mass is approximately 1 cm in diameter—
such  a  mass  consists  of  about  109  cells.  Often,  patients  present  with 
tumors  that  are  approximately  1010  cells.  Although  it  varies  by  type 
of  cancer  and  where  the  primary  tumor  and  metastases  are  located, 
a lethal tumor burden is usually about 1012–1013 cells. If all malignant 
cells were dividing without any cell death at the time of diagnosis, most 
patients would reach a lethal tumor burden in a very short time. How-
ever, human tumors grow by Gompertzian kinetics—this means that 
not every daughter cell produced by a cell division is actively dividing. 
In addition, the overall growth rate of a tumor depends on differences 
between growth rates of different cells within the tumor and rate of cell 
loss.  The  growth  fraction  of  a  tumor  declines  with  time,  largely  due 
to  factors  in  the  microenvironment.  The  growth  fraction  of  the  first 
malignant cell is 100%, and by the time a patient presents for medical 
care, the growth fraction is estimated to be <10%, although the fraction 
varies between different types of cancers and even different cancers of 
the  same  type  in  different  individuals.  This  fraction  is  often  similar 
to the growth fraction of normal bone marrow and normal intestinal 
epithelium, the most highly proliferative normal tissues in the human 
body, a fact that may explain the dose-limiting toxicities to these tissues 
of agents that target dividing cells.

The implication of these data is that the tumor is slowing its own 
growth over time. How does it do this? The tumor cells have multiple 
genetic  lesions  that  tend  to  promote  proliferation,  yet  by  the  time 
the  tumor  is  clinically  detectable,  its  capacity  for  proliferation  has 
declined. Better understanding of how a tumor slows its own growth 
would provide important clues for better cancer treatment. A num-
ber of factors, including those in the tumor microenvironment, are 
known to contribute to the decreased proliferation of tumor cells over 
time in vivo. Some cells are hypoxemic and have inadequate supply 
of nutrients and energy. Some have sustained too much genetic dam-
age to complete the cell cycle but have lost the capacity to undergo 
apoptosis and therefore survive but do not proliferate. However, an 
important subset is not actively dividing but retains the capacity to 
divide and can start dividing again under certain conditions such as 
when the tumor mass is reduced by treatments leading to improved 
conditions in the tumor microenvironment favorable for cell prolif-
eration. Just as the bone marrow increases its rate of proliferation in 
response to bone marrow–damaging agents, the tumor also seems to 
sense when tumor cell numbers have been reduced and can respond 
by  increasing  growth  rate.  However,  the  critical  difference  is  that 
the marrow stops growing when it has reached its production goals, 
whereas tumors do not.

The ultimate structure and organization of an organ are based on a 
number of factors including growth, migration, elimination, and death 
of various cells; communication between cells to establish the correct 
architecture;  competition  between  cells;  and  the  composition  of  the 
extracellular matrix that is produced. In addition to normal cells stop-
ping proliferation in an organ when that is appropriate, normal tissues 
have various mechanisms for eliminating cells both in the process of 
development as well as ongoing homeostasis of an organ. These include 
mechanical processes based on a number of factors including cell size, 
shape, and topology between cells that can determine cell fate as well 
as an active process of cell extrusion, which plays a major role in the 
elimination of both cells that are no longer needed by the organ and 
cells that are damaged and potentially dangerous (such as those with 
mutations  that  might  be  precursors  for  malignancy).  The  process  of 
cell extrusion may depend on cell cycle arrest in the S phase; aberra-
tions in this process may contribute to the metastatic process. A variety 
of processes, including major alterations in cell cycle control, apoptosis 
and other mechanisms of cell death, and uncontrolled cell signaling, all 
contribute to defects in appropriate cell extrusion contributing to the 
development of cancer.

Additional tumor cell vulnerabilities are likely to be detected when 
we learn more about how normal cells respond to “stop” signals from 
their  environment,  and  why  and  how  tumor  cells  and  tissues  fail  to 
heed such signals.

 ■ CELL CYCLE CHECKPOINTS
The cell division cycle consists of four phases—G1 (growth and prep-
aration  for  DNA  synthesis),  S  (DNA  synthesis),  G2  (preparation  to 
divide), and M (mitosis, cell division). Cells can also exit the cell cycle 
and  be  quiescent  (G0).  Progression  of  a  cell  through  the  cell  cycle  is 
tightly  regulated  at  a  number  of  checkpoints  (especially  at  the  G1/S 
boundary,  the  G2/M  boundary,  and  during  M  [spindle  checkpoint]) 
by  an  array  of  genes  that  are  targeted  by  specific  genetic  alterations 
in  cancer.  Critical  proteins  in  these  control  processes  that  are  fre-
quently mutated or otherwise inactivated in cancers are called tumor- 
suppressor  genes.  Examples  include  p53  and  Rb  (discussed  below). 
In  the  first  phase,  G1,  preparations  are  made  to  replicate  the  genetic 
material.  The  cell  stops  before  entering  the  DNA  synthesis  phase,  or 
S phase, to take inventory. Are we ready to replicate our DNA? Is the 
DNA repair machinery in place to fix any mutations that are detected? 
Are  the  DNA  replicating  enzymes  available?  Is  there  an  adequate 
supply of nucleotides? Is there sufficient energy to proceed? The retin-
oblastoma  protein,  Rb,  plays  a  central  role  in  placing  a  brake  on  the 
process until the cell is ready. When the cell determines that it is pre-
pared to move ahead, sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 
(CDKs) results in the inactivation of the brake, Rb, by phosphorylation. 
Phosphorylated Rb releases the S phase–regulating transcription factor, 
E2F/DP1, and genes required for S-phase progression are expressed. If 
the cell determines that it is unready to move ahead with DNA repli-
cation, a number of inhibitors are capable of blocking the action of the 
CDKs, including p21Cip2/Waf1, p16Ink4a, and p27Kip1. Nearly every 
cancer has one or more defects in the G1 checkpoint that permit pro-
gression to S phase despite abnormalities in DNA repair machinery or 
other deficiencies that would affect normal DNA synthesis.

At  the  end  of  the  G2  phase  and  prior  to  the  M  phase,  after  the  cell 
has exactly duplicated its DNA content, a second inventory is taken at 
the G2 checkpoint. Have all of the chromosomes been fully duplicated? 
Were all segments of DNA copied only once? Has all damaged DNA 
been  repaired?  Do  we  have  the  right  number  of  chromosomes  and 
the  right  amount  of  DNA?  If  so,  the  cell  proceeds  to  prepare  for 
division  by  synthesizing  mitotic  spindle  and  other  proteins  needed 
to  produce  two  daughter  cells.  If  DNA  damage  is  detected,  the  p53 
pathway  is  normally  activated.  Called  the  guardian  of  the  genome, 
p53 is a transcription factor that is normally present in the cell in very 
low levels. This level is generally regulated through its rapid turnover. 
Normally, p53 is bound to mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase that both inhibits 
p53  transcriptional  activation  and  also  targets  p53  for  degradation 
in  the  proteasome.  When  DNA  damage  is  sensed,  the  ATM  (ataxia- 
telangiectasia  mutated)  pathway  is  activated;  ATM  phosphorylates 
mdm2,  releasing  it  from  its  inhibitory  bond  to  p53.  p53  then  stops 
cell cycle progression, directs the synthesis of repair enzymes, or if the 
damage is too great, initiates apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the 
cell to prevent the propagation of a damaged cell (Fig. 72-1).

A second method of activating p53 involves the induction of p14ARF 
by hyperproliferative signals from oncogenes. p14ARF competes with 
p53 for binding to mdm2, allowing p53 to escape the effects of mdm2 
and  accumulate  in  the  cell.  p53  then  stops  cell  cycle  progression  by 
activating CDK inhibitors such as p21 and/or initiating the apoptosis 
pathway. Not surprisingly given its critical role in controlling cell cycle 
progression,  mutations  in  the  gene  for  p53  on  chromosome  17p  are 
among the most frequent mutations in human cancers, although per-
centages vary between different cancers. Most commonly these muta-
tions are acquired in the malignant tissue in one allele and the second 
allele is inactivated (such as by deletion or epigenetic silencing), leaving 
the  cell  unprotected  from  DNA-damaging  agents  or  activated  onco-
genes.  Some  environmental  exposures  produce  signature  mutations 
in p53; for example, aflatoxin exposure leads to mutation of arginine 
to serine at codon 249 and leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. In rare 
instances, p53 mutations are in the germline (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) 
and produce a familial cancer syndrome. Another mechanism for inac-
tivation of p53 in malignant cells is due to alterations in regulators such 
as overexpression of the inhibitory mdm2 protein. Whether inactivated 
by mutation or inhibited by regulatory factors, absence of normal p53 
function leads to chromosomal instability and accumulation of DNA

FIGURE  72-1  Induction  of  p53  by  the  DNA  damage  and  oncogene  checkpoints. 
In  response  to  noxious  stimuli,  p53  and  mdm2  are  phosphorylated  by  the  ataxia-
telangiectasia  mutated  (ATM)  and  related  ATR  serine/threonine  kinases,  as  well 
as  the  immediate  downstream  checkpoint  kinases,  Chk1  and  Chk2.  This  causes 
dissociation  of  p53  from  mdm2,  leading  to  increased  p53  protein  levels  and 
transcription  of  genes  leading  to  cell  cycle  arrest  (p21Cip1/Waf1)  or  apoptosis  (e.g., 
the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Noxa and Puma). Inducers of p53 include 
hypoxemia,  DNA  damage  (caused  by  ultraviolet  radiation,  gamma  irradiation,  or 
chemotherapy),  ribonucleotide  depletion,  and  telomere  shortening.  A  second 
mechanism of p53 induction is activated by oncogenes such as Myc, which promote 
aberrant G1/S transition. This pathway is regulated by a second product of the Ink4a 
locus, p14ARF (p19 in mice), which is encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF) 
of the same stretch of DNA that codes for p16Ink4a. Levels of ARF are upregulated by 
Myc and E2F, and ARF binds to mdm2 and rescues p53 from its inhibitory effect. This 
oncogene checkpoint leads to the death or senescence (an irreversible arrest in G1 
of the cell cycle) of renegade cells that attempt to enter S phase without appropriate 
physiologic  signals.  Senescent  cells  have  been  identified  in  patients  whose 
premalignant  lesions  harbor  activated  oncogenes,  for  instance,  dysplastic  nevi 
that encode an activated form of BRAF (see below), demonstrating that induction 
of senescence is a protective mechanism that operates in humans to prevent the 
outgrowth of neoplastic cells.

damage  including  acquisition  of  properties  that  give  the  abnormal 
cell a proliferative and survival advantage. Like Rb dysfunction, most 
cancers  have  mechanisms  that  disable  the  p53  pathway.  Indeed,  the 
importance of p53 and Rb in the development of cancer is underscored 
by the neoplastic transformation mechanism of human papillomavirus. 
This virus has two main oncogenes, E6 and E7. E6 acts to increase the 
rapid turnover of p53, and E7 acts to inhibit Rb function; inhibition of 
these two targets is required for transformation of epithelial cells.

Another  cell  cycle  checkpoint  exists  when  the  cell  is  undergoing 
division  (M  phase);  this  is  the  spindle  checkpoint,  which  acts  to 
ensure that there is proper attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic 
spindle before progression through the cell cycle can occur. If the spin-
dle apparatus does not properly align the chromosomes for division, if 
the chromosome number is abnormal (i.e., greater or less than 4n), or if 
the centromeres are not properly paired with their duplicated partners, 
then the cell initiates a cell death pathway to prevent the production 
of  aneuploid  progeny  (having  an  altered  number  of  chromosomes). 
Abnormalities  in  the  spindle  checkpoint  facilitate  the  development 
of aneuploidy, which is frequently found in cancers. In some tumors, 
aneuploidy is a predominant genetic feature.

In other tumors, a defect in the cells’ ability to repair errors in the 
DNA, such as due to mutations in genes coding for the proteins critical 
for mismatched DNA repair, is the primary genetic lesion. Cancer cells 
can have defects in any of several DNA repair pathways in addition to 
mismatch repair, including deficient interstrand cross-link, double-strand 
breaks  (homologous  recombination  or  nonhomologous  end  joining 
repair),  single-strand  breaks,  base  excision,  nucleotide  excision,  and 
translesional synthesis.

In  general,  tumors  have  either  defects  in  chromosome  number  or 
defective DNA repair pathways but not both. Defects that lead to cancer 
include abnormal cell cycle checkpoints, inadequate DNA repair, and 
failure  to  preserve  genome  integrity  leading  to  DNA  damage.  These 

defects  and  the  stress  of  the  resultant  increased  DNA  damage  make 
cancer  cells  more  vulnerable  to  additional  DNA  damage,  which  can 
be exploited by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and 
immunotherapy—the major systemic therapeutic approaches effective 
against cancer.

Alternatively,  research  is  ongoing  in  an  attempt  to  therapeutically 
restore the defects in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair that charac-
terize cancer, although this remains a challenging problem because it is 
much more difficult to restore normal biologic function than to inhibit 
abnormal function of proteins driving cell proliferation, such as occurs 
with  oncogenes.  Newer  approaches  to  gene  editing  (e.g.,  clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]) and subse-
quent modifications to this approach should make this more feasible.

 ■ CELLULAR SENESCENCE
The  irreversible  cessation  of  growth  of  normal  cells  while  the  cells 
remain viable has been termed cellular senescence. This was initially 
identified by the fact that when normal cells are placed in culture in 
vitro,  most  are  not  capable  of  sustained  growth.  They  quickly  reach 
a  point  where  they  either  undergo  cell  death  due  to  excessive  DNA 
damage or other factors or they become senescent. Fibroblasts are an 
exception to this rule. When they are cultured, fibroblasts may divide 
30–50  times  and  then  they  undergo  what  has  been  termed  a  “crisis” 
during  which  the  majority  of  cells  stop  dividing  (usually  due  to  an 
increase in p21 expression, a CDK inhibitor). This form of senescence 
is  termed  replicative  senescence.  Many  other  cells  die,  and  a  small 
fraction emerge that have acquired genetic and epigenetic changes that 
permit their uncontrolled growth.

Among the cellular changes during in vitro propagation is telomere 
shortening. DNA polymerase is unable to replicate the tips of chromo-
somes, resulting in the loss of DNA at the specialized ends of chromo-
somes (called telomeres) with each replication cycle. At birth, human 
telomeres  are  15-  to  20-kb  pairs  long  and  are  composed  of  tandem 
repeats  of  a  six-nucleotide  sequence  (TTAGGG)  that  associate  with 
specialized telomere-binding proteins to form a T-loop structure that 
protects the ends of chromosomes from being mistakenly recognized 
as damaged. The loss of telomeric repeats with each cell division cycle 
causes gradual telomere shortening, leading to growth arrest when one 
or  more  critically  short  telomeres  trigger  a  p53-regulated  DNA-damage 
checkpoint response. Cell death usually ensues when the unprotected 
ends  of  chromosomes  lead  to  chromosome  fusions  or  other  cata-
strophic DNA rearrangements. Cells with certain abnormalities, such 
as  those  with  nonfunctional  pRb  and  p53,  can  bypass  this  growth 
arrest. The ability to bypass telomere-based growth limitations is thought 
to be a critical step in the evolution of most malignancies. This occurs 
by reactivation of telomerase expression in cancer cells. Telomerase is 
an  enzyme  that  adds  TTAGGG  repeats  onto  the  3′  ends  of  chromo-
somes. It contains a catalytic subunit with reverse transcriptase activity 
(hTERT) and an RNA component that provides the template for telo-
mere  extension.  Most  normal  somatic  cells  do  not  express  sufficient 
telomerase to prevent telomere attrition with each cell division. Excep-
tions include stem cells (such as those found in hematopoietic tissues, 
gut  and  skin  epithelium,  and  germ  cells)  that  require  extensive  cell 
division to maintain tissue homeostasis. More than 90% of human can-
cers express high levels of telomerase that prevent telomere shortening 
to critical levels and allow indefinite cell proliferation. In vitro experi-
ments indicate that inhibition of telomerase activity leads to tumor cell 
apoptosis.  Major  efforts  are  underway  to  develop  methods  to  inhibit 
telomerase activity in cancer cells. For example, the protein component 
of  telomerase  (hTERT)  may  act  as  one  of  the  most  widely  expressed 
tumor-associated antigens and can be targeted by vaccine approaches. 
However, a caveat to targeting telomerase for anticancer treatment is 
the potential for inhibiting its activity in certain normal cells (such as 
stem cells) required for maintaining the normal physiologic state.

Although most of the functions of telomerase relate to cell division, 
it  also  has  several  other  effects  including  interfering  with  the  differ-
entiated  functions  of  at  least  certain  stem  cells.  However,  the  impact 
on  differentiated  function  of  normal  nonstem  cells  is  less  clear.  The 
picture is further complicated by the fact that rare genetic defects in the

telomerase enzyme seem to cause dyskeratosis congenita (characterized 
by abnormalities in various rapidly dividing cells in the body including 
skin,  nails,  oral  mucosa,  hair,  and  bone  marrow  with  increased  risk 
for  leukemia  and  certain  other  cancers).  This  can  be  associated  with 
a  number  of  other  abnormalities  including  pulmonary  fibrosis,  bone 
marrow failure (aplastic anemia), or liver fibrosis. However, paradox-
ically,  defects  in  nutrient  absorption  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  a 
site  that  should  be  highly  sensitive  to  defective  cell  proliferation,  are 
not seen. Much remains to be learned about how telomere shortening 
and telomere maintenance are related to human illness in general and 
cancer in particular.

A variety of other stresses on cells (both environmental and intrin-
sic  including  radiation,  chemotherapy,  reactive  oxygen  species,  and 
oncogenic mutations) can also lead to senescence, primarily those that 
induce DNA damage similar to that seen in cells with shortened telo-
meres. This is termed replicative senescence.

 ■ SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS IN  
CANCER CELLS
Signals that affect cell behavior come from adjacent cells, the stroma in 
which the cells are located, hormonal signals that originate remotely, 
and the cells themselves (autocrine signaling). These signals generally 
exert their influence on the receiving cell through activation of signal 
transduction  pathways  that  have  as  their  end  result  the  induction  of 
activated transcription factors that mediate a change in cell behavior 
or  function  or  the  acquisition  of  effector  machinery  to  accomplish  a 
new  task.  Although  signal  transduction  pathways  can  lead  to  a  wide 
variety of outcomes, many such pathways rely on cascades of signals 
that sequentially activate different proteins or glycoproteins and lipids 
or  glycolipids,  and  the  activation  steps  often  involve  the  addition  or 
removal  of  one  or  more  phosphate  groups  on  a  downstream  target. 
Other chemical changes can result from signal transduction pathways, 
but  reversible  phosphorylation  and  dephosphorylation  play  a  major 
role. Proteins that add phosphate groups to other molecules (proteins, 
lipids, or nucleic acids) are called kinases. Two major classes of kinases 
involved  in  signal  transduction  pathways  important  for  cancer  cells 
are tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine and serine/threonine 
kinases  that  phosphorylate  serine/threonine  either  directly  or  indi-
rectly.  However,  some  kinases  can  phosphorylate  both,  such  as  the 
MEK  kinases  that  can  phosphorylate  both  threonine  and  tyrosine. 
Phosphatases  (protein  tyrosine  phosphatases  and  protein  serine/
threonine phosphatases) remove the phosphate groups to reverse the 
kinase activity.

Various kinases play critical roles in signal transduction pathways 
important  for  malignant  cells.  These  include  a  number  of  receptor 
tyrosine  kinases  (RTKs)  as  well  as  various  protein  kinases  (both 
tyrosine  and  serine/threonine  kinases)  downstream  of  receptors 
that transmit the signals within the cell (Fig. 72-2). Two important 
signaling  pathways  are  the  RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK  pathway  and  the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (Fig. 72-2). Although 
pathways  are  depicted  as  distinct,  there  are  complex  interactions 
between pathways within cells.

Normally,  kinase  activity  is  short-lived  and  reversed  by  protein 
phosphatases.  However,  in  many  human  cancers,  RTKs  or  compo-
nents  of  their  downstream  pathways  are  activated  by  mutation,  gene 
amplification, or chromosomal translocations to have enhanced and/or 
prolonged activity. Because these pathways are important in regulating 
proliferation,  survival,  migration,  and  angiogenesis,  they  have  been 
identified as important targets for cancer therapeutics.

Inhibition of kinase activity is effective in the treatment of a number 
of  neoplasms.  Lung  cancers  with  mutations  in  the  epidermal  growth 
factor  receptor  are  highly  responsive  to  osimertinib  as  well  as  other 
inhibitors  (Table 72-2).  Inhibitors  have  been  developed  to  treat  lung 
cancers  with  other  tyrosine  kinase–activating  mutations  (including 
anaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  [ALK],  ROS1,  NTRK,  MET,  and  RET) 
BRAF  (a  serine/threonine  kinase)  inhibitors  are  highly  effective  in 
melanomas and thyroid cancers and are also used in combination with 
other  agents  for  lung  and  colon  cancers  in  which  BRAF  is  mutated. 
Targeting the MEK protein (which phosphorylates both threonine and 

tyrosine residues) downstream of BRAF also has activity against BRAF 
mutant  melanomas,  and  combined  inhibition  of  BRAF  and  MEK  is 
more  effective  than  either  alone  with  activity  that  extends  to  BRAF 
mutant lung cancer. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are active in mye-
loproliferative syndromes in which JAK2 activation is a pathogenetic 
event. Imatinib (which targets a number of tyrosine kinases) is an effec-
tive agent in tumors that have translocations of the c-Abl and BCR gene 
(such  as  chronic  myeloid  leukemia),  mutant  c-Kit  (gastrointestinal 
stromal cell tumors), or mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
(PDGFRα; gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Second-generation inhib-
itors of BCR-Abl, dasatinib and nilotinib, are even more effective, and 
the third-generation agent bosutinib has activity in some patients who 
have progressed on other inhibitors, while the third-generation agent 
ponatinib  has  activity  against  the  T315I  mutation,  which  is  resistant 
to the other agents. Although almost all tyrosine kinase inhibitors are 
not entirely selective for one protein, certain inhibitors have significant 
activity against a broad number of proteins. These include sorafenib, 
regorafenib, cabozantinib, sunitinib, and lenvatinib. These have shown 
antitumor activity in various malignancies, including renal cell cancer 
(RCC)  (sorafenib,  sunitinib,  cabozantinib,  lenvatinib),  hepatocellular 
carcinoma  (sorafenib,  regorafenib,  lenvatinib),  gastrointestinal  stro-
mal tumor (GIST) (sunitinib, regorafenib), thyroid cancer (sorafenib, 
cabozantinib, lenvatinib), colorectal cancer (regorafenib), and pancre-
atic neuroendocrine tumors (sunitinib).

Inhibitors of the PI3K pathway also have been approved for cancer 
therapy.  The  PI3K  family  includes  three  classes  and  several  isoforms 
within  each  class.  Inhibitors  against  different  isoforms  have  proved 
effective  against  different  types  of  malignancies,  with  inhibitors  of 
the  delta  isoform  (either  specifically  or  also  with  inhibition  of  other 
isoforms;  e.g.,  idelalisib)  having  activity  against  lymphoid  malignan-
cies, whereas the specific inhibitor of a mutation in the alpha isoform 
(alpelisib) has activity against breast cancers with this mutation. Inhib-
itors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; which is downstream 
of PI3K; e.g., everolimus, temsirolimus) are active in RCC, pancreatic 
neuroendocrine  tumors,  and  breast  cancer.  Additional  inhibitors  of 
the PI3K pathway and other phospholipid signaling pathways such as 
the  phospholipase  C-gamma  pathway,  which  are  involved  in  a  large 
number  of  cellular  processes  important  in  cancer  development  and 
progression, are being evaluated.

The list of active agents and treatment indications is growing rapidly 
(Table 72-2). These agents have ushered in a new era of personalized 
therapy. It is becoming more common for tumor biopsies to be assessed 
for specific molecular changes that predict response and to have clini-
cal decision-making guided by those results. This is now an important 
component of standard therapy for metastatic lung, gastroesophageal, 
melanoma, breast, and colorectal cancers as well as in adjuvant therapy 
for breast cancer.

An alternative approach to testing samples directly from tumors is to 
test blood for the presence of mutations or amplification in circulating 
tumor DNA, which has the significant advantage of being noninvasive. 
As cancers grow, some of the cells die and break down with release of 
cellular contents, including DNA, into the circulation. Sensitive meth-
ods have been developed to detect this DNA and to identify mutations 
and other DNA changes in the malignant cells. This has the potential 
advantage  over  tumor  biopsies  of  sampling  all  of  the  tumor  and  not 
being limited to one site that may not be representative of the overall 
tumor heterogeneity. In addition to identifying potential changes that 
can be targeted for therapy, there is also the potential for monitoring 
a  patient’s  response  to  therapy,  identifying  resistance  mechanisms  to 
therapy earlier, detecting disease recurrence before it can be detected 
by  tumor  markers  or  scans,  monitoring  bodily  fluids  in  addition  to 
blood,  and  possibly  providing  a  means  of  earlier  initial  detection  of 
cancer  if  sufficiently  sensitive  and  specific  detection  methods  can  be 
developed.

However, none of these targeted therapies has yet been curative by 
themselves for any malignancy, although prolonged periods of disease 
control lasting many years frequently occur in chronic myeloid leuke-
mia  (CML),  including  a  >80%  survival  rate  at  10  years.  The  reasons 
for the failure to cure are not completely defined, although resistance

FIGURE 72-2  Therapeutic targeting of signal transduction pathways in cancer cells. Three major signal transduction pathways are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs). 1. The protooncogene Ras is activated by the Grb2/mSOS guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which induces an association with Raf and activation of downstream 
kinases (MEK and ERK1/2). 2. Activated PI3K phosphorylates the membrane lipid PIP2 to generate PIP3, which acts as a membrane-docking site for a number of cellular 
proteins including the serine/threonine kinases PDK1 and Akt. PDK1 has numerous cellular targets, including Akt and mTOR. Akt phosphorylates target proteins that promote 
resistance to apoptosis and enhance cell cycle progression, while mTOR and its target p70S6K upregulate protein synthesis to potentiate cell growth. 3. Activation of PLC-γ 
leads the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and increased intracellular calcium, with activation of multiple isoforms of PKC and other enzymes regulated by the calcium/
calmodulin system. Other important signaling pathways involve non-RTKs that are activated by cytokine or integrin receptors. Janus kinases (JAK) phosphorylate STAT 
(signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factors, which translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes. Integrin receptors mediate cellular 
interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM), inducing activation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and c-Src, which activate multiple downstream pathways, including 
modulation of the cell cytoskeleton. Many activated kinases and transcription factors migrate into the nucleus, where they regulate gene transcription, thus completing the 
path from extracellular signals, such as growth factors, to a change in cell phenotype, such as induction of differentiation or cell proliferation. The nuclear targets of these 
processes include transcription factors (e.g., Myc, AP-1, and serum response factor) and the cell cycle machinery (cyclin-dependent kinases [CDKs] and cyclins). Inhibitors 
of many of these pathways have been developed for the treatment of human cancers. Examples of inhibitors that are either approved or are currently being evaluated in 
clinical trials are shown in purple type.

to the treatment ultimately develops in most patients. In some tumors, 
resistance to kinase inhibitors is related to proliferation of cells with a 
mutation in the target kinase that inhibits drug binding. Many of these 
kinase inhibitors act as competitive inhibitors of the ATP-binding pocket. 
ATP  is  the  phosphate  donor  in  these  phosphorylation  reactions.  For 
example,  mutation  in  the  critical  BCR-ABL  kinase  in  the  ATP-bind-
ing  pocket  (such  as  the  threonine  to  isoleucine  change  at  codon  315 
[T315I]) can prevent imatinib binding. Other resistance mechanisms 
include  alterations  in  other  signal  transduction  pathways  to  bypass 
the inhibited pathway. As resistance mechanisms continue to be bet-
ter  defined,  rational  strategies  to  overcome  resistance  are  emerging. 
In addition, many kinase inhibitors are less specific for an oncogenic 
target than was hoped, and toxicities related to off-target inhibition of 
kinases limit the use of the agent at a dose that would optimally inhibit 
the cancer-relevant kinase.

Antibodies against protein targets more highly expressed on malig-
nant  than  normal  cells  can  also  be  used  to  deliver  highly  toxic  com-
pounds relatively specifically to cancer cells. Examples of protein targets 
for  currently  approved  antibody-drug  conjugates  include  CD30  for 
Hodgkin’s and anaplastic lymphomas; HER2 on breast cancer; CD33 on 

acute myeloid leukemias; CD22 on B-cell acute lymphocytic and hairy 
cell leukemias; and CD79b on diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

Another strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of targeted agents 
is to use them in rational combinations with each other as well as with 
chemotherapy  or  immunotherapy  agents  that  kill  cells  in  ways  dis-
tinct from agents targeting specific mutant or overexpressed proteins. 
Combinations of trastuzumab (a monoclonal antibody that targets the 
HER2  receptor  [member  of  the  EGFR  family])  with  chemotherapy 
have significant activity against breast and stomach cancers that have 
high levels of expression of the HER2 protein. The activity of trastu-
zumab  and  chemotherapy  can  be  enhanced  further  by  combinations 
with  another  targeted  monoclonal  antibody  (pertuzumab),  which 
prevents  dimerization  of  the  HER2  receptor  with  other  HER  family 
members including HER3.

Although  targeted  therapies  have  not  yet  resulted  in  cures  when 
used alone, their use in the adjuvant setting and when combined with 
other  effective  treatments  has  substantially  increased  the  fraction  of 
patients cured. For example, the addition of rituximab, an anti-CD20 
antibody,  to  combination  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  diffuse 
large  B-cell  lymphoma  improves  cure  rates  by  ~15%.  The  addition

of  trastuzumab,  antibody  to  HER2,  to  combination  chemotherapy  in 
the  adjuvant  treatment  of  HER2-positive  breast  cancer  significantly 
improves overall survival.

A major effort continues to develop targeted therapies for mutations 
in  the  ras  family  of  genes,  which  play  a  critical  role  in  transmitting 
signals through a number of downstream signaling pathways including 
the MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase and PI3K pathways. Muta-
tions in ras are the most common mutations in oncogenes in cancers 
(especially kras) but have proved to be very difficult targets for a num-
ber of reasons related to the structure of RAS proteins as well as mech-
anisms of activation and inactivation (active when bound to guanosine 
triphosphate  [GTP]  and  inactive  when  bound  to  guanosine  diphos-
phate  [GDP]).  RAS  proteins  are  not  kinases  but  bind  directly  to  the 
BRAF serine/threonine kinase with preferential binding when RAS is in 
the active GTP bound state. Preliminary evidence indicates antitumor 
activity of agents that target one of the mutant forms of KRAS (12C) 
that is found in a subset of cancers. Indirect inhibition of RAS function 
by inhibiting farnesyl transferase, which is important for RAS binding 
to the membrane and is required for activation, has shown some prom-
ise  against  HRAS  mutant  head  and  neck  cancers.  Targeted  therapies 
against a subset of proteins downstream of RAS in the MAP kinase sig-
naling pathway (including BRAF and MAP kinase) have proven to have 
significant antitumor activity against V600E BRAF mutant melanoma, 
with improved efficacy when they are used in combination. However, 
similar activity is not seen against ras mutant tumors. Additional tar-
geted therapies against other proteins downstream of RAS (including 
ERK, or combinations of MAP kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy) 
are being studied, both individually and in combination. However, at 
this  time,  there  is  no  clinically  approved  approach  to  inhibiting  RAS 
mutant tumors.

For  reasons  that  have  not  been  fully  elucidated,  this  has  a  differen-
tial  toxicity  effect  on  tumor,  as  compared  to  normal,  cells.  Although 
this  mechanism  appears  to  be  an  important  aspect  of  the  antitumor 
effects  of  proteasome  inhibitors,  there  are  other  effects  involving  the 
inhibition of the degradation of multiple cellular proteins important in 
malignant cell survival or proliferation. Proteasome inhibitors (borte-
zomib,  carfilzomib,  ixazomib)  have  activity  in  patients  with  multiple 
myeloma, including partial and complete remissions. Inhibitors of IKK 
are also in development, with the hope of more selectively blocking the 
degradation  of  IκB,  thus  “locking”  NF-κB  in  an  inhibitory  complex 
and rendering the cancer cell more susceptible to apoptosis-inducing 
agents. Many other transcription factors are activated by phosphory-
lation, which can be prevented by tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase 
inhibitors, a number of which are currently in clinical trials.

Estrogen receptors (ERs) and androgen receptors (ARs), members 
of the steroid hormone family of nuclear receptors, are targets of inhi-
bition by drugs used to treat breast and prostate cancers, respectively. 
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been developed 
as  a  treatment  approach  for  ER-positive  breast  cancer.  Tamoxifen,  a 
partial  agonist  and  antagonist  of  ER  function,  is  frequently  used  in 
breast  cancer  and  can  mediate  tumor  regression  in  metastatic  breast 
cancer  and  can  prevent  disease  recurrence  in  the  adjuvant  setting. 
Tamoxifen binds to the ER and modulates its transcriptional activity, 
inhibiting  activity  in  the  breast  but  promoting  activity  in  bone  but 
unfortunately also in uterine epithelium, leading to a small increased 
risk  of  uterine  cancer.  Attempts  have  been  made  to  develop  SERMs 
that would have antiestrogenic effects in both breast and uterus while 
maintaining protective effects on bone. However, none of these to date 
has been an improvement over tamoxifen. Aromatase inhibitors, which 

One  of  the  strategies  for  new  drug 
development is to take advantage of so-
called  oncogene  addiction.  This  situa-
tion (Fig. 72-3) is created when a tumor 
cell develops an activating mutation in 
an  oncogene  that  becomes  a  domi-
nant  pathway  for  survival  and  growth 
with reduced contributions from other 
pathways,  even  when  there  may  be 
abnormalities  in  those  pathways.  This 
dependency on a single pathway creates 
a cell that is vulnerable to inhibitors of 
that  oncogene  pathway.  For  example, 
cells harboring mutations in BRAF are 
very  sensitive  to  MEK  inhibitors  that 
inhibit  downstream  signaling  in  the 
BRAF pathway.

Proteins  critical  for  transcription  of 
other  proteins  essential  for  malignant 
cell  survival  or  proliferation  provide 
another potential target for treating can-
cers.  The  transcription  factor  nuclear 
factor  (NF)-κB  is  a  heterodimer  com-
posed  of  p65  and  p50  subunits  that 
associate with an inhibitor, IκB, in the 
cell  cytoplasm.  In  response  to  growth 
factor  or  cytokine  signaling,  a  multi-
subunit kinase called IKK (IκB-kinase) 
phosphorylates IκB and directs its deg-
radation  by  the  ubiquitin/proteasome 
system.  NF-κB,  free  of  its  inhibitor, 
translocates  to  the  nucleus  and  acti-
vates target genes, many of which pro-
mote  the  survival  of  tumor  cells.  One 
of  the  mechanisms  by  which  novel 
drugs  called  proteasome  inhibitors  are 
thought to produce an anticancer effect 
is  by  blocking  the  proteolysis  of  IκB, 
thereby  preventing  NF-κB  activation.

FIGURE 72-3  Synthetic lethality. Genes are said to have a synthetic lethal relationship when mutation of either gene 
alone is tolerated by the cell, but mutation of both genes leads to lethality, as originally noted by Bridges and later named 
by Dobzhansky. Thus, mutant gene a and gene b have a synthetic lethal relationship, implying that the loss of one gene 
makes the cell dependent on the function of the other gene. In cancer cells, loss of function of a DNA repair gene like 
BRCA1, which repairs double-strand breaks, makes the cell dependent on base excision repair mediated in part by PARP. 
If the PARP gene product is inhibited, the cell attempts to repair the break using the error-prone nonhomologous end-
joining method, which results in tumor cell death. High-throughput screens can now be performed using isogenic cell line 
pairs in which one cell line has a defined defect in a DNA repair pathway. Compounds can be identified that selectively 
kill the mutant cell line; targets of these compounds have a synthetic lethal relationship to the repair pathway and are 
potentially important targets for future therapeutics.

block the conversion of androgens to estrogens in breast and subcuta-
neous fat tissues, have demonstrated improved clinical efficacy com-
pared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and are often used as 
first-line therapy in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive disease. 
They are occasionally used in premenopausal patients with ER-positive 
disease  in  combination  with  ovarian  suppression  approaches  such  as 
luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. A number 
of approaches have been developed for blocking androgen stimulation 
of  prostate  cancer,  including  decreasing  production  by  the  testicles 
(e.g.,  orchiectomy,  LHRH  agonists  or  antagonists),  directly  blocking 
actions  of  androgen  (a  number  of  agents  have  been  developed  to  do 
this), or blocking production by inhibiting the enzyme CYP17, which 
is central in production of androgens from cholesterol (Chap. 79).

 ■ CANCER-SPECIFIC GENETIC CHANGES AND 
SYNTHETIC LETHALITY
The concepts of oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality have spurred new 
drug development targeting oncogene- and tumor-suppressor pathways. As 
discussed earlier in this chapter and outlined in Fig. 72-3, cancer cells can 
become dependent upon signaling pathways containing activated onco-
genes; this can effect proliferation (i.e., mutated KRAS, BRAF, overex-
pressed MYC, or activated tyrosine kinases). Additional genetic changes 
in malignant cells or unique features of tumors including defects in DNA 
repair (e.g., loss of BRCA1 or  BRCA2 gene function), modifications in 
cell cycle control (e.g., changes in protein levels or mutations in cyclins 
and  cyclin  dependent  kinases),  enhanced  survival  mechanisms  (over-
expression of Bcl-2 or NF-κB), altered cell metabolism (such as occurs 
when  mutant  KRAS  enhances  glucose  uptake  and  aerobic  glycolysis), 
tumor-stromal  interactions,  and  angiogenesis  (e.g.,  production  of  vas-
cular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] in response to HIF-2α in RCC) 
can also be successfully exploited to relatively specifically target cancers. 
However, resistance to inhibition of specific oncogenic pathways almost 
always  eventually  develops.  In  addition,  targeting  defects  in  tumor- 
suppressor genes has been much more difficult, both because the target 
of  mutation  is  often  deleted  and  because  it  is  much  more  difficult  to 
restore normal function than to inhibit abnormal function of a protein.
Synthetic lethality occurs when loss of function in either of two or 
more  genes  individually  has  limited  effects  on  cell  survival  but  loss 
of function in both (or more) genes leads to cell death. In the case of 
oncogene  addicted  pathways,  identifying  genes  that  have  a  synthetic 
lethal relationship with the activated pathway may allow enhanced cell 
killing and decreased resistance by targeting those genes or their pro-
teins. In the case of mutant tumor-suppressor genes, identifying genes 
that have a synthetic lethal relationship to those mutated pathways may 
allow targeting by inhibiting proteins required uniquely by those cells 
for survival or proliferation (Fig. 72-3). This is a much more tractable 
approach than attempting to repair normal function of the mutant sup-
pressor gene itself. Examples of synthetic lethality with clinical impact 
have been identified. For instance, cells with mutations in the BRCA1 
or BRCA2 tumor-suppressor genes (e.g., a subset of breast and ovarian 
cancers) are unable to repair DNA damage by homologous recombi-
nation.  Poly-ADP  ribose  polymerase  (PARP)  is  a  family  of  proteins 
important for single-strand break (SSB) DNA repair. PARP inhibition 
results  in  selective  killing  of  cancer  cells  that  have  lost  BRCA1  or 
BRCA2 function. A number of PARP inhibitors have been approved for 
treatment of ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers that have 
mutations in BRCA genes, as well as for maintenance therapy of ovar-
ian cancer and are likely to have activity in other tumors with defective 
DNA repair mechanisms. The concept of synthetic lethality provides a 
framework for genetic screens to identify other synthetic lethal combi-
nations involving known tumor-suppressor genes and development of 
novel therapeutic agents to target dependent pathways. Other unique 
aspects of malignant tumors, including those outlined elsewhere in the 
chapter, may also be vulnerable to synthetic lethal interactions.

 ■ EPIGENETIC INFLUENCES ON CANCER GENE 
TRANSCRIPTION
Chromatin  structure  regulates  the  hierarchical  order  of  sequential 
gene transcription that governs differentiation and tissue homeostasis. 

Disruption of chromatin remodeling (the process of modifying chro-
matin structure to control exposure of specific genes to transcriptional 
proteins,  thereby  controlling  the  expression  of  those  genes)  leads  to 
aberrant  gene  expression  that  can  significantly  alter  the  biology  of 
cells including inducing proliferation or migration of cells. Epigenetic 
changes are those that alter the pattern of gene expression that persist 
across at least one cell division, but are not caused by changes in the 
DNA code. These include alterations of chromatin structure mediated 
by  methylation  of  cytosine  residues  of  DNA  (primarily  in  context 
of  CpG  dinucleotides  in  somatic  cells),  modification  of  histones  by 
altering acetylation or methylation, or changes in higher-order chro-
mosome structure (Fig. 72-4). Appropriate control of DNA methyla-
tion is essential for normal cell function and development, and both 
altered methylation and hypomethylation of histones occur in cancers. 
Hypermethylation of DNA promoter regions is a common mechanism 
by  which  tumor-suppressor  loci  are  epigenetically  silenced  in  cancer 
cells. Thus, one allele of a tumor-suppressor gene may be inactivated by 
mutation or deletion, while expression of the other allele is epigeneti-
cally silenced, usually by methylation, leading to loss of gene function. 
Aberrant hypomethylation is also frequently found in a number of can-
cers consistent with the dysregulated pattern of gene transcription that 
is  a  hallmark  of  cancer  cells,  with  some  genes  being  inappropriately 
turned off while others are inappropriately turned on.

Acetylation of the amino terminus of the core histones H3 and H4 
induces an open chromatin conformation that promotes transcription 
initiation. Histone acetylases are components of coactivator complexes 
recruited  to  promoter/enhancer  regions  by  sequence-specific  tran-
scription  factors  during  the  activation  of  genes  (Fig.  72-4).  Histone 
deacetylases  (HDACs;  multiple  HDACs  are  encoded  in  the  human 
genome) are recruited to genes by transcriptional repressors and pre-
vent the initiation of gene transcription. Methylated cytosine residues 
in promoter regions become associated with methyl cytosine–binding 
proteins  that  recruit  protein  complexes  with  HDAC  activity.  The 
balance  between  permissive  and  inhibitory  chromatin  structure  is 
therefore  largely  determined  by  the  activity  of  transcription  factors 
in  modulating  the  “histone  code”  and  the  methylation  status  of  the 
genetic regulatory elements of genes.

The pattern of gene transcription is aberrant in all human cancers, 
and in many cases, epigenetic events are responsible. Epigenetic events 
play a critical role in carcinogenesis (e.g., long-lasting changes in meth-
ylation  induced  by  smoking)  and  are  found  in  premalignant  lesions. 
Unlike genetic events that alter DNA primary structure (e.g., deletions), 
epigenetic  changes  are  potentially  reversible  and  appear  amenable  to 
therapeutic intervention. In certain human cancers, including a subset 
of pancreatic cancers and multiple myeloma, the p16Ink4a promoter is 
inactivated by methylation, thus permitting the unchecked activity of 
CDK4/cyclin D and rendering pRb nonfunctional. In sporadic forms 
of  renal,  breast,  and  colon  cancer,  the  von  Hippel–Lindau  (VHL), 
breast  cancer  1  (BRCA1),  and  serine/threonine  kinase  11  (STK11) 
genes, respectively, can be epigenetically silenced. Other targeted genes 
include  the  p15Ink4b  CDK  inhibitor,  glutathione-S-transferase  (which 
detoxifies reactive oxygen species [ROS]), and the E-cadherin molecule 
(important for junction formation between epithelial cells). Epigenetic 
silencing can affect genes involved in DNA repair, thus predisposing to 
further genetic damage. Examples include MLH1 (mutL homologue in 
sporadic colon cancers that have microsatellite instability) and MSH2 
in a subset of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer patients who have 
a mutation in the 3′ end of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM). 
These  are  critical  genes  involved  in  repair  of  mismatched  bases  that 
occur during DNA synthesis, and their silencing can lead to mutations 
in the DNA.

Human leukemias often have chromosomal translocations that code 
for novel fusion proteins with activities that alter chromatin structure 
by  interacting  with  HDACs  or  histone  acetyl  transferases  (HATs). 
For  example,  the  promyelocytic  leukemia–retinoic  acid  receptor  α 
(PML-RARα)  fusion  protein,  generated  by  the  t(15;17)  translocation 
observed in most cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), binds 
to promoters containing retinoic acid response elements and recruits 
HDACs  to  these  promoters,  effectively  inhibiting  gene  expression.

FIGURE 72-4  Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in cancer cells. Tumor-suppressor genes are often epigenetically silenced in cancer cells. In the upper portion, a CpG 
island within the promoter and enhancer regions of the gene has been methylated, resulting in the recruitment of methyl-cytosine binding proteins (MeCP) and complexes 
with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Chromatin is in a condensed, nonpermissive conformation that inhibits transcription. Clinical trials are under way utilizing the 
combination of demethylating agents such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine plus HDAC inhibitors, which together confer an open, permissive chromatin structure (lower portion). 
Transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences in promoter regions and, through protein-protein interactions, recruit coactivator complexes containing histone acetyl 
transferase (HAT) activity. This enhances transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and associated general transcription factors. The expression of the tumor-suppressor 
gene commences, with phenotypic changes that may include growth arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis.

This  arrests  differentiation  at  the  promyelocyte  stage  and  promotes 
tumor  cell  proliferation  and  survival.  Treatment  with  pharmacologic 
doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the ligand for RARα, results 
in  the  release  of  HDAC  activity  and  the  recruitment  of  coactivators, 
which overcome the differentiation block. This induced differentiation 
of APL cells has improved treatment of these patients but also has led 
to  a  novel  treatment  toxicity  when  newly  differentiated  tumor  cells 
infiltrate  the  lungs.  ATRA  represents  a  treatment  paradigm  for  the 
reversal  of  epigenetic  changes  in  cancer.  Other  leukemia-associated 
fusion proteins, such as Tel-acute myeloid leukemia (AML1), AML1-
eight-twenty-one  (ETO),  and  the  MLL  fusion  proteins  seen  in  acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia, also lead to 
repression through the HDAC complex. Therefore, efforts are ongoing 
to  determine  the  structural  basis  for  interactions  between  transloca-
tion  fusion  proteins  and  chromatin-remodeling  proteins  and  to  use 
this information to rationally design small molecules that will disrupt 
specific  protein-protein  associations,  although  this  has  proven  to  be 
technically  difficult.  Several  drugs  that  block  the  enzymatic  activity 
of  HDACs  (HDAC  inhibitors  [HDACis])  are  approved  for  cancer 
treatment,  and  others  are  being  tested.  HDACis  have  demonstrated 
sufficient antitumor activity against cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (vori-
nostat, romidepsin), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (romidepsin, belinos-
tat), and multiple myeloma (panobinostat) to be approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

HDACis  have  also  demonstrated  antitumor  activity  in  clinical 
studies  against  some  solid  tumors,  and  additional  studies  are  ongo-
ing.  HDACis  may  target  cancer  cells  via  a  number  of  mechanisms 
including  both  epigenetic  modulation  via  histone  acetylation  and 
effects on other proteins that are acetylated. The pleiotropic effects of 
some HDACis include enhancement of apoptosis by upregulation of a 
number of proteins that enhance apoptosis including death receptors 
(DR4/5, FAS, and their ligands) and downregulation of proteins that 

inhibit apoptosis (e.g., X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis [XIAP]); upreg-
ulation  of  proteins  that  inhibit  cell  cycle  progression  (e.g.,  p21Cip1/
Waf1);  inhibition  of  DNA  repair  and  generation  of  ROS  leading  to 
increased  DNA  damage;  and  disruption  of  the  chaperone  protein 
HSP90.

Efforts  are  also  under  way  to  modulate  other  epigenetic  processes 
such as reversing the hypermethylation of CpG islands that character-
izes  many  malignancies.  Drugs  that  induce  DNA  demethylation,  such 
as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, can lead to reexpression of silenced genes in 
cancer  cells  with  restoration  of  function,  and  5-aza-2-deoxycytidine 
is  approved  for  use  in  myelodysplastic  syndrome.  However,  5-aza-2- 
deoxycytidine  has  limited  aqueous  solubility  and  is  myelosuppressive, 
limiting its usefulness. Other inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases are 
in development. In ongoing clinical trials, inhibitors of DNA methylation 
are being combined with HDACis, with the idea that reversing coexisting 
epigenetic  changes  will  reverse  the  deregulated  patterns  of  gene  tran-
scription in cancer cells.

Epigenetic  gene  regulation  can  also  occur  via  microRNAs  or  long 
noncoding RNAs (lncRNA). MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short (average 
22 nucleotides in length) RNA molecules that silence gene expression 
after transcription by binding and inhibiting the translation or promot-
ing  the  degradation  of  mRNA  transcripts.  It  is  estimated  that  >1000 
miRNAs are encoded in the human genome. Each tissue has a distinc-
tive repertoire of miRNA expression, and this pattern is altered in spe-
cific ways in cancers. Specific correlations between miRNA expression 
and  tumor  biology  and  clinical  behavior  are  continuing  to  emerge. 
Therapies targeting miRNAs are not currently at hand but represent an 
ongoing area of treatment development. LncRNAs are longer than 200 
nucleotides and comprise the largest group of noncoding RNAs. Some 
of them have been shown to play important roles in gene regulation. 
The potential for altering these RNAs for therapeutic benefit is an area 
of active investigation.

APOPTOSIS AND OTHER MECHANISMS OF 
CELL DEATH
Tissue  homeostasis  requires  a  balance  between  the  death  of  aged, 
terminally  differentiated  cells  or  severely  damaged  cells  and  their 
renewal by proliferation of committed progenitors. Genetic damage to 
growth-regulating genes of stem cells could lead to catastrophic results 
for the host as a whole. Thus, genetic events causing activation of onco-
genes or loss of tumor suppressors, which would be predicted to lead to 
unregulated cell proliferation unless corrected, usually activate signal 
transduction  pathways  that  block  aberrant  cell  proliferation.  These 
pathways can lead to a form of programmed cell death (apoptosis) or 
irreversible  growth  arrest  (senescence).  Much  as  a  panoply  of  intra- 
and extracellular signals impinge upon the core cell cycle machinery 
to regulate cell division, so too these signals are transmitted to a core 
enzymatic machinery that regulates cell death and survival.

Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process induced by two main path-
ways  (Fig.  72-5).  The  extrinsic  pathway  of  apoptosis  is  activated  by 

cross-linking  members  of  the  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  receptor 
superfamily,  such  as  CD95  (Fas)  and  death  receptors  DR4  and  DR5, 
by their ligands, Fas ligand or TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand), respectively. This induces the association of FADD (Fas-asso-
ciated death domain) and procaspase-8 to death domain motifs of the 
receptors. Caspase-8 is activated and then cleaves and activates effector 
caspases-3  and  -7,  which  then  target  cellular  constituents  (including 
caspase-activated DNase, cytoskeletal proteins, and a number of reg-
ulatory proteins), inducing the morphologic appearance characteristic 
of apoptosis, which pathologists term karyorrhexis. The intrinsic path-
way of apoptosis is initiated by the release of cytochrome c and SMAC 
(second mitochondrial activator of caspases) from the mitochondrial 
intermembrane  space  in  response  to  a  variety  of  noxious  stimuli, 
including DNA damage, loss of adherence to the extracellular matrix 
(ECM),  oncogene-induced  proliferation,  and  growth  factor  depriva-
tion.  Upon  release  into  the  cytoplasm,  cytochrome  c  associates  with 
dATP,  procaspase-9,  and  the  adaptor  protein  APAF-1,  leading  to  the

FIGURE  72-5  Therapeutic  strategies  to  overcome  aberrant  survival  pathways  in  cancer  cells.  1.  The  extrinsic  pathway  of  apoptosis  can  be  selectively  induced  in 
cancer cells by TRAIL (the ligand for death receptors 4 and 5) or by agonistic monoclonal antibodies. 2. Inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members with antisense 
oligonucleotides or inhibitors of the BH3-binding pocket will promote formation of Bak- or Bax-induced pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. 3. Epigenetic silencing 
of APAF-1, caspase-8, and other proteins can be overcome using demethylating agents and inhibitors of histone deacetylases. 4. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) 
blocks activation of caspases; small-molecule inhibitors of IAP function (mimicking SMAC action) should lower the threshold for apoptosis. 5. Signal transduction pathways 
originating with activation of receptor tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) or cytokine receptors promote survival of cancer cells by a number of mechanisms. Inhibiting 
receptor function with monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab or cetuximab, or inhibiting kinase activity with small-molecule inhibitors can block the pathway. 6. The 
Akt kinase phosphorylates many regulators of apoptosis to promote cell survival; inhibitors of Akt may render tumor cells more sensitive to apoptosis-inducing signals; 
however, the possibility of toxicity to normal cells may limit the therapeutic value of these agents. 7 and 8. Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (composed of p65 
and p50 subunits) occurs when its inhibitor, IκB, is phosphorylated by IκB-kinase (IKK), with subsequent degradation of IκB by the proteasome. Inhibition of IKK activity 
should selectively block the activation of NF-κB target genes, many of which promote cell survival. Inhibitors of proteasome function are U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
approved and may work in part by preventing destruction of IκB, thus blocking NF-κB nuclear localization. NF-κB is unlikely to be the only target for proteasome inhibitors.

sequential activation of caspase-9 and effector caspases. SMAC binds 
to  and  blocks  the  function  of  inhibitor  of  apoptosis  proteins  (IAP), 
negative regulators of caspase activation.

The release of apoptosis-inducing proteins from the mitochondria 
is  regulated  by  pro-  and  antiapoptotic  members  of  the  Bcl-2  family. 
Antiapoptotic members (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) associate with 
the mitochondrial outer membrane via their carboxyl termini, expos-
ing to the cytoplasm a hydrophobic binding pocket composed of Bcl-2 
homology  (BH)  domains  1,  2,  and  3  that  is  crucial  for  their  activity. 
Perturbations  of  normal  physiologic  processes  in  specific  cellular 
compartments lead to the activation of BH3-only proapoptotic family 
members (e.g., Bad, Bim, Bid, Puma, Noxa, and others) that can alter 
the conformation of the outer-membrane proteins Bax and Bak, which 
then oligomerize to form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane 
resulting in cytochrome c release. If proteins comprised only by BH3 
domains are sequestered by Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Mcl-1, pores do not form 
and apoptosis-inducing proteins are not released from the mitochon-
dria.  The  ratio  of  levels  of  antiapoptotic  Bcl-2  family  members  and 
the  levels  of  proapoptotic  BH3-only  proteins  at  the  mitochondrial 
membrane determines the activation state of the intrinsic pathway. The 
mitochondrion must therefore be recognized not only as an organelle 
with vital roles in intermediary metabolism and oxidative phosphory-
lation but also as a central regulatory structure of the apoptotic process.
The  evolution  of  tumor  cells  to  a  more  malignant  phenotype 
requires  the  acquisition  of  genetic  changes  that  subvert  apoptosis 
pathways and promote cancer cell survival and resistance to anticancer 
therapies. However, cancer cells may be more vulnerable than normal 
cells  to  therapeutic  interventions  that  target  the  apoptosis  pathways 
that  cancer  cells  depend  upon.  For  instance,  overexpression  of  Bcl-2 
as  a  result  of  the  t(14;18)  translocation  contributes  to  follicular  lym-
phoma,  and  it  is  highly  expressed  in  many  lymphoid  malignancies 
including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Upregulation of Bcl-2 
expression is also observed in other cancers including prostate, breast, 
and  lung  cancers  and  melanoma.  Targeting  of  antiapoptotic  Bcl-2 
family members has been accomplished by the identification of several 
low-molecular-weight compounds that bind to the hydrophobic pock-
ets of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and block their ability to associate with 
death-inducing BH3-only proteins. An oral BH3 mimetic inhibitor of 
BCL-2, venetoclax, is approved for use in patients with refractory CLL 
with 17p deletion and is active in acute myeloid leukemia.

Preclinical  studies  targeting  death  receptors  DR4  and  -5  have 
demonstrated  that  recombinant,  soluble,  human  TRAIL  or  human-
ized  monoclonal  antibodies  with  agonist  activity  against  DR4  or  -5 
can  induce  apoptosis  of  tumor  cells  while  sparing  normal  cells.  The 
mechanisms for this selectivity may include expression of decoy recep-
tors or elevated levels of intracellular inhibitors (such as FLIP, which 
competes  with  caspase-8  for  FADD)  by  normal  cells  but  not  tumor 
cells. Synergy has been shown between TRAIL-induced apoptosis and 
chemotherapeutic agents in some preclinical studies. However, studies 
have not yet shown significant clinical activity of approaches targeting 
the TRAIL pathway.

Many of the signal transduction pathways perturbed in cancer pro-
mote  tumor  cell  survival  (Fig.  72-5).  These  include  activation  of  the 
PI3K/Akt pathway, increased levels of the NF-κB transcription factor, 
and epigenetic silencing of genes such as APAF-1 (apoptosis protease 
activating  factor-1  involved  in  activating  caspase-9  and  essential  for 
apoptosis) and caspase-8. Each of these pathways is a target for thera-
peutic agents that, in addition to affecting cancer cell proliferation or 
gene expression, may render cancer cells more susceptible to apoptosis, 
thus promoting synergy when combined with other chemotherapeutic 
agents.

Some tumor cells resist drug-induced apoptosis indirectly by elim-
inating  the  noxious  stimulus-inducing  apoptosis  through  expression 
of one or more members of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette proteins) 
family  of  ATP-dependent  efflux  pumps  that  mediate  the  multidrug- 
resistance  (MDR)  phenotype.  The  prototype  member  of  this  family, 
P-glycoprotein (PGP), spans the plasma membrane 12 times and has 
two  ATP-binding  sites.  Hydrophobic  drugs  (e.g.,  anthracyclines  and 
vinca alkaloids) are recognized by PGP as they enter the cell and are 

pumped out. Numerous clinical studies have failed to demonstrate that 
drug  resistance  can  be  overcome  using  inhibitors  of  PGP.  However, 
ABC transporters have different substrate specificities, and inhibition 
of a single family member may not be sufficient to overcome the MDR 
phenotype. Efforts to reverse PGP-mediated drug resistance continue.
Cells, including cancer cells, can also undergo other mechanisms of 
cell death including autophagy (degradation of proteins and organelles 
by lysosomal proteases) and necrosis (digestion of cellular components 
and  rupturing  of  the  cell  membrane).  Necrosis  usually  occurs  in 
response to external forces resulting in release of cellular components, 
which  leads  to  inflammation  and  damage  to  surrounding  tissues. 
Although  necrosis  was  thought  to  be  unprogrammed,  evidence  now 
suggests that at least some aspects may also be programmed. The exact 
role  of  necrosis  in  cancer  cell  death  in  various  settings  is  still  being 
determined.  In  addition  to  its  role  in  cell  death,  autophagy  can  also 
serve as a homeostatic mechanism to promote survival for the cell by 
recycling cellular components to provide necessary energy. The mech-
anisms  that  control  the  balance  between  enhancing  survival  versus 
leading to cell death are still not fully understood. Autophagy appears 
to  play  conflicting  roles  in  the  development  and  survival  of  cancer. 
Early in the carcinogenic process, it can act as a tumor suppressor by 
preventing the cell from accumulating abnormal proteins and organ-
elles. However, in established tumors, it may serve as a mechanism of 
survival for cancer cells when they are stressed by damage such as from 
chemotherapy. Preclinical studies have indicated that inhibition of this 
process  can  enhance  the  sensitivity  of  cancer  cells  to  chemotherapy 
or  radiation  therapy,  and  ongoing  trials  are  evaluating  inhibitors  of 
autophagy in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation ther-
apy. Better understanding of the factors that control the survival-promoting 
versus  death-inducing  aspects  of  autophagy  is  required  in  order  to 
know how to best manipulate it for therapeutic benefit.

 ■ METASTASIS
The metastatic process accounts for the vast majority of deaths from 
solid tumors, and therefore, an understanding of this process is critical 
for  improvements  in  survival  from  cancer.  The  biology  of  metastasis 
is  complex  and  requires  multiple  steps.  The  initial  step  involves  cell 
migration  and  invasion  through  the  ECM.  The  three  major  features 
of tissue invasion are cell adhesion to the basement membrane, local 
proteolysis  of  the  membrane,  and  movement  of  the  cell  through  the 
rent in the membrane and the ECM. Cells that lose contact with the 
ECM  normally  undergo  programmed  cell  death  (anoikis-apoptosis 
induced by the loss of contact), and this process has to be suppressed 
in cells that metastasize. Another process important for many, but 
not  necessarily  all,  metastasizing  epithelial  cancer  cells  is  epithelial- 
mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is a process by which cells lose 
their epithelial properties and gain mesenchymal properties. This nor-
mally occurs during the developmental process in embryos, allowing 
cells to migrate to their appropriate destinations in the embryo. It also 
occurs  in  wound  healing,  tissue  regeneration,  and  fibrotic  reactions, 
but in all of these processes, cells stop proliferating when the process 
is complete. Malignant cells that metastasize often undergo EMT as an 
important step in that process but retain the capacity for unregulated 
proliferation.  However,  there  is  evidence  that  not  all  metastasizing 
cancer  cells  require  EMT,  and  the  exact  role  of  EMT  in  different 
metastasizing cancer cells continues to be elucidated. Malignant cells 
that  gain  access  to  the  circulation  must  then  repeat  those  steps  at  a 
remote site, find a hospitable niche in a foreign tissue, avoid detection 
and  elimination  by  host  defenses  including  the  immune  system,  and 
induce the growth of new blood vessels. Some metastatic cells occur 
as oligoclonal clusters, which appear to be more potent in establishing 
metastasis than single cells, perhaps, in part, through differential and 
cooperative  effects  in  evading  host  defenses.  The  rate-limiting  step 
for  metastasis  is  the  ability  for  tumor  cells  to  survive  and  expand  in 
the novel microenvironment of the metastatic site, and multiple host- 
tumor  interactions  determine  the  ultimate  outcome  (Fig.  72-6).  Few 
drugs  have  been  developed  to  attempt  to  directly  target  the  process 
of metastasis, in part because the specifics of the critical steps in the 
process that would be potentially good targets for drugs are still being

FIGURE 72-6  Oncogene signaling pathways are activated during tumor progression and promote metastatic potential. This figure shows a cancer cell that has undergone 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) under the influence of several environmental signals. Critical components include activated transforming growth factor beta 
(TGF-β) and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met pathways, as well as changes in the expression of adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell and cell–extracellular 
matrix interactions. Important changes in gene expression are mediated by the Snail and Twist family of transcriptional repressors (whose expression is induced by the 
oncogenic pathways), leading to reduced expression of E-cadherin, a key component of adherens junctions between epithelial cells. This, in conjunction with upregulation 
of N-cadherin, a change in the pattern of expression of integrins (which mediate cell–extracellular matrix associations that are important for cell motility), and a switch in 
intermediate filament expression from cytokeratin to vimentin, results in the phenotypic change from adherent highly organized epithelial cells to motile and invasive cells 
with a fibroblast or mesenchymal morphology. EMT is thought to be an important step leading to metastasis in some human cancers. Host stromal cells, including tumor-
associated fibroblasts and macrophages, play an important role in modulating tumor cell behavior through secretion of growth factors and proangiogenic cytokines, and 
matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the basement membrane. VEGF-A, -C, and -D are produced by tumor cells and stromal cells in response to hypoxemia or oncogenic 
signals and induce production of new blood vessels and lymphatic channels through which tumor cells metastasize to lymph nodes or tissues.

identified. However, a number of potential targets are known. HER2 
can  enhance  the  metastatic  potential  of  breast  cancer  cells,  and  as 
discussed above, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, which targets 
HER2,  improves  survival  in  the  adjuvant  setting  for  HER2-positive 
breast cancer patients. A number of other potential targets that increase 
metastatic potential of cells in preclinical studies include HIF-1 and -2, 
transcription factors induced by hypoxia within tumors, growth factors 
(e.g., cMET and VEGFR), oncogenes (e.g., SRC), adhesion molecules 
(e.g., focal adhesion kinase [FAK]), ECM proteins (e.g., matrix metal-
loproteinases 1 and 2), and inflammatory molecules (e.g., COX-2).

The metastatic phenotype is likely restricted to a fraction of tumor 
cells  (Fig.  72-6).  A  number  of  genetic  and  epigenetic  changes  are 
required for tumor cells to be able to metastasize, including activation 
of  metastatic-promoting  genes  and  inhibition  of  genes  that  suppress 
the metastatic ability. Given the role of microRNAs in controlling gene 
expression (see epigenetic section) including those critical to the meta-
static process, efforts are under way to modulate these to try to inhibit 
metastasis. Cells with metastatic capability frequently express chemok-
ine  receptors  that  are  likely  important  in  the  metastatic  process.  A 
number of candidate metastasis-suppressor genes have been identified, 
including genes coding for proteins that enhance apoptosis, suppress 
cell division, are involved in the interactions of cells with each other 
or the ECM, or suppress cell migration. The loss of function of these 
genes enhances metastasis. Gene expression profiling is being used to 

study the metastatic process and other properties of tumor cells that 
may predict susceptibilities.

An example of the ability of malignant cells to survive and grow in 
a novel microenvironment is bone metastases. Bone metastases can be 
extremely painful, cause fractures of weight-bearing bones, can lead to 
hypercalcemia, and are a major cause of morbidity for cancer patients. 
Osteoclasts and their monocyte-derived precursors express the surface 
receptor  RANK  (receptor  activator  of  NF-κB),  which  is  required  for 
terminal differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. Osteoblasts and 
other  stromal  cells  express  RANK  ligand  (RANKL),  as  both  a  mem-
brane-bound and soluble cytokine. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble 
receptor for RANKL produced by stromal cells, acts as a decoy recep-
tor  to  inhibit  RANK  activation.  The  relative  balance  of  RANKL  and 
OPG  determines  the  activation  state  of  RANK  on  osteoclasts.  Many 
tumors increase osteoclast activity by secretion of substances such as 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, interleukin (IL) 1, 
or Mip1 that perturb the homeostatic balance of bone remodeling by 
increasing RANK signaling. One example is multiple myeloma, where 
tumor  cell–stromal  cell  interactions  activate  osteoclasts  and  inhibit 
osteoblasts, leading to the development of multiple lytic bone lesions. 
Inhibition  of  RANKL  by  an  antibody  (denosumab)  can  prevent  fur-
ther  bone  destruction.  Bisphosphonates  are  also  effective  inhibitors 
of osteoclast function that are used in the treatment of cancer patients 
with bone metastases.

PART 4Oncology and Hematology ■ CANCER STEM CELLS
Normal  tissues  have  stem  cells  capable  of  self-renewal  and  repairing 
damaged tissue, whereas the majority of cells in normal tissues do not 
have this capacity. Similarly, only a small proportion of the cells within 
a tumor are capable of initiating colonies in vitro or forming tumors 
at  high  efficiency  when  injected  into  immunocompromised  NOD/
SCID mice. For example, AML and CML have a small population of 
cells  (estimated  to  be  <1%)  that  have  properties  of  stem  cells,  such 
as  unlimited  self-renewal  and  the  capacity  to  cause  leukemia  when 
serially  transplanted  in  mice.  These  cells  have  an  undifferentiated 
phenotype (Thy1–CD34+CD38– and do not express other differenti-
ation markers) and resemble normal stem cells in many ways but are 
no  longer  under  homeostatic  control  (Fig.  72-7).  Solid  tumors  may 
also contain a population of stem cells. It is not yet known how often 
cancers may originate within a stem cell population. Cancer stem cells, 
like  their  normal  counterparts,  have  unlimited  proliferative  capacity 
and paradoxically traverse the cell cycle at a slow rate; cancer growth 
occurs largely due to expansion of the stem cell pool, the unregulated 
proliferation  of  an  amplifying  population,  and  failure  of  apoptosis 
pathways  (Fig.  72-7).  Slow  cell  cycle  progression  and  high  levels  of 
expression  of  antiapoptotic  Bcl-2  family  members  and  drug  efflux 
pumps of the MDR family render cancer stem cells less vulnerable to 
cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Implicit in the cancer stem 
cell hypothesis is the idea that failure to cure most human cancers is 
due to the fact that current therapeutic agents do not kill the stem cells. 
Identification and isolation of cancer stem cells will allow determina-
tion of the aberrant signaling pathways that distinguish these cells from 

normal  tissue  stem  cells.  These  would  serve  as  potential  therapeutic 
targets.  Evidence  that  cells  with  stem  cell  properties  can  arise  from 
other epithelial cells within the cancer by processes such as epithelial 
mesenchymal transition also implies that it is essential to treat all of the 
cancer cells, and not just those with current stem cell–like properties, 
in  order  to  eliminate  the  self-renewing  cancer  cell  population.  The 
exact nature of cancer stem cells remains an area of investigation. One 
of the unanswered questions is the exact origin of cancer stem cells for 
the different cancers.

PLASTICITY AND RESISTANCE
Cancer  cells,  and  especially  stem  cells,  have  the  capacity  for  signifi-
cant  plasticity  allowing  them  to  alter  multiple  aspects  of  cell  biology 
in response to external factors (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
inflammation, immune response). In addition, heterogeneity between 
the  different  clones  of  cells  within  the  tumor  population  and  their 
interactions  with  each  other  and  the  tumor  microenvironment  pro-
vides the tumor with the capacity for significant plasticity in dealing 
with both internal and external stresses. Thus, a major problem in can-
cer therapy is that malignancies have a wide spectrum of mechanisms 
for  both  initial  and  adaptive  resistance  to  treatments.  These  include 
inhibiting  drug  delivery  to  the  cancer  cells,  blocking  drug  uptake 
and  retention,  increasing  drug  metabolism,  altering  levels  of  target 
proteins making them less sensitive to drugs, acquiring mutations in 
target proteins making them no longer sensitive to the drug, modify-
ing metabolism and cell signaling pathways, using alternate signaling 
pathways, adjusting the cell replication process including mechanisms

FIGURE 72-7  Cancer stem cells play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy of malignant neoplasms. In normal tissues (left), homeostasis is 
maintained by asymmetric division of stem cells leading to one progeny cell that will differentiate and one cell that will maintain the stem cell pool. This occurs within highly 
specific niches unique to each tissue, such as in close apposition to osteoblasts in bone marrow, or at the base of crypts in the colon. Here, paracrine signals from stromal 
cells, such as sonic hedgehog or Notch ligands, as well as upregulation of β-catenin and telomerase, help to maintain stem cell features of unlimited self-renewal while 
preventing differentiation or cell death. This occurs in part through upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 and inhibition of the p16Ink4a/Arf and p53 pathways. 
Daughter cells leave the stem cell niche and enter a proliferative phase (referred to as transit-amplifying) for a specified number of cell divisions, during which time a 
developmental program is activated, eventually giving rise to fully differentiated cells that have lost proliferative potential. Cell renewal equals cell death, and homeostasis 
is maintained. In this hierarchical system, only stem cells are long-lived. The hypothesis is that cancers harbor stem cells that make up a small fraction (i.e., 0.001–1%) of 
all cancer cells. These cells share several features with normal stem cells, including an undifferentiated phenotype, unlimited self-renewal potential, and a capacity for 
some degree of differentiation; however, due to initiating mutations (mutations are indicated by lightning bolts), they are no longer regulated by environmental cues. The 
cancer stem cell pool is expanded, and rapidly proliferating progeny, through additional mutations, may attain stem cell properties, although most of this population is 
thought to have a limited proliferative capacity. Differentiation programs are dysfunctional due to reprogramming of the pattern of gene transcription by oncogenic signaling 
pathways. Within the cancer transit-amplifying population, genomic instability generates aneuploidy and clonal heterogeneity as cells attain a fully malignant phenotype 
with metastatic potential. The cancer stem cell hypothesis has led to the idea that current cancer therapies may be effective at killing the bulk of tumor cells but do not 
kill tumor stem cells, leading to a regrowth of tumors that is manifested as tumor recurrence or disease progression. Research is in progress to identify unique molecular 
features of cancer stem cells that can lead to their direct targeting by novel therapeutic agents.

by  which  the  cell  deals  with  DNA  damage,  inhibiting  apoptosis,  and 
evading  the  immune  system.  Thus,  most  metastatic  cancers  (except 
those curable with chemotherapy such as germ cell tumors) eventually 
become resistant to the therapy being utilized. Overcoming resistance 
is a major area of research.
 ■ CANCER METABOLISM
One of the distinguishing characteristics of cancer cells is that they have 
altered metabolism as compared with normal cells in supporting sur-
vival, their high rates of proliferation, and ability to metastasize. Com-
plicating studies evaluating metabolic differences between normal and 
malignant  cells  is  that  there  is  heterogeneity  in  metabolism  between 
different cells within a cancer. Malignant cells must focus a significant 
fraction of their energy resources into synthesis of proteins and other 
molecules  (building  blocks  required  for  the  production  of  new  cells) 
while still maintaining sufficient ATP production to survive and grow. 
Although normal proliferating cells also have similar needs, there are 
differences  in  how  cancer  cells  metabolize  glucose  and  a  number  of 
other compounds including the amino acid glutamine as compared to 
normal cells in part because of genetic and epigenetic changes within 
cancer  cells  but  also  likely  due  to  differences  in  the  environments  of 
cancer  and  normal  cells.  Many  cancer  cells  utilize  aerobic  glycolysis 
(the  Warburg  effect)  (Fig.  72-8)  to  metabolize  glucose,  leading  to 
increased lactic acid production, whereas normal cells utilize oxidative 
phosphorylation  in  mitochondria  under  aerobic  conditions,  a  much 
more  efficient  process  for  generating  ATP  for  energy  utilization  but 
one that does not produce the same level of building blocks needed for 
new cells. One consequence is increased glucose uptake and utilization 
by cancer cells, a fact utilized in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron 
emission tomography (PET) scanning to detect tumors. A number of 
proteins  in  cancer  cells,  including  cMYC,  HIF1,  RAS,  p53,  pRB,  and 
AKT, are involved in modulating glycolytic processes and controlling 
the Warburg effect. Although these pathways remain difficult to target 
therapeutically, both the PI3K pathway with signaling through mTOR 
and the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) pathway that inhibits mTORC1 
(a protein complex that includes mTOR) are important in controlling 
the glycolytic process and thus provide potential targets for inhibiting 
this process. An inhibitor of mTOR is approved for use against RCC 
(temsirolimus), and another inhibitor (everolimus) has activity against 
breast and neuroendocrine cancer and RCC. Other mTOR inhibitors 

are  in  trials,  and  modulators  of  AMPK  are  being  investigated.  The 
inefficient utilization of glucose by malignant cells also leads to a need 
for alternative metabolic pathways for other compounds as well, one of 
which is glutamine. Similar to glucose, this provides both a source for 
structural molecules as well as energy production. Similarly to glucose, 
glutamine  is  also  inefficiently  utilized  by  cancer  cells.  Cancer  cells 
can  also  take  up  nutrients  released  by  surrounding  cells  and  tissues, 
increasing  the  complexity  of  successfully  therapeutically  inhibiting 
metabolism in cancer.

Mutations  in  genes  involved  in  the  metabolic  process  occur  in  a 
number  of  cancers.  Among  the  most  frequently  found  to  date  are 
mutations  in  isocitrate  dehydrogenases  1  and  2  (IDH1  and  IDH2). 
These have been most commonly seen in gliomas, AMLs, and intrahe-
patic cholangiocarcinomas. These mutations lead to the production of 
an oncometabolite (2-hydroxyglutarate [2HG]) instead of the normal 
product α-ketoglutarate. Although the exact mechanisms of oncogen-
esis by 2HG are still being elucidated, α-ketoglutarate is a key cofactor 
for a number of dioxygenases involved in controlling DNA methyla-
tion. 2HG can act as a competitive inhibitor for α-ketoglutarate, lead-
ing  to  alterations  in  methylation  status  (primarily  hypermethylation) 
of genes (leading to epigenetic changes) that can have profound effects 
on a number of cellular processes including differentiation. Inhibitors 
of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 are approved for treating IDH mutant AML 
and are in clinical trials for glioblastomas and cholangiocarcinomas.

Much needs to be learned about the specific differences in metab-
olism  between  cancer  cells  and  normal  cells;  however,  even  with  the 
currently  limited  state  of  knowledge,  modulators  of  metabolism  are 
being tested clinically. The first of these is the antidiabetic agent met-
formin, both alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. 
Metformin  inhibits  gluconeogenesis  and  may  have  direct  effects  on 
tumor  cells  by  activating  AMPK,  a  serine/threonine  protein  kinase 
that is downstream of the LKB1 tumor suppressor, and thus inhibiting 
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This leads to decreased protein synthesis 
and proliferation. Studies to date have not yet established metformin to 
have a clear role as an anticancer agent.
 ■ TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT, ANGIOGENESIS, 
AND IMMUNE EVASION
Tumors consist not only of malignant cells but also of a complex microen-
vironment including many other types of cells (including lymphocytes,

phosphorylation that efficiently generates about 36 molecules of ATP for each molecule of glucose metabolized. By contrast, proliferative tumor tissues, especially in the 
setting of hypoxia, a typical condition within tumors, use aerobic glycolysis to generate energy for cell survival and generation of building blocks for new cells.

cells, fibroblasts, and fat cells), ECM, secreted factors 
(including  growth  factors  and  hormones),  reactive 
oxygen  and  nitrogen  species,  mechanical  factors, 
blood  vessels,  and  lymphatics.  This  microenviron-
ment is not static but rather is dynamic and contin-
ually  evolving.  Both  the  complexity  and  dynamic 
nature  of  the  microenvironment  enhance  the  dif-
ficulty  of  treating  tumors.  The  microenvironment 
can contribute to resistance to anticancer therapies 
through a number of mechanisms.
 ■ OBESITY AND CANCER
Significant evidence links obesity and the increased 
risk  of  developing  certain  cancers  including  post-
menopausal  breast,  colorectal,  ovarian,  endome-
trial,  esophageal,  gallbladder,  thyroid,  and  kidney 
cancers, among others. Less certain are the mech-
anisms responsible for this risk. As outlined above, 
cancers  arise  in  an  environment  with  multiple 
factors, many of which can stimulate cell prolifera-
tion. Obesity impacts a variety of factors including 
hormonal  factors,  altered  metabolism  (especially 
adipose metabolism), and mediators of inflamma-
tory response that all can impact the development 
of malignancy. Obesity is associated with a number 
of  hormonal  changes  including  high  insulin,  glu-
cagon,  and  leptin  levels  that  can  stimulate  growth 
of  cells.  It  also  leads  to  insulin  resistance,  which 
may contribute to cancer cell development, in part 
by  increasing  insulin-like  growth  factor-1  (IGF-1) 
levels. Obesity also leads to alterations in adipose, 
including  fatty  acid,  metabolism,  with  production 
of  compounds  important  for  energy  metabolism 
as well as for membrane function within cells that 
may  contribute  to  carcinogenic  process.  Obesity 
contributes  to  an  inflammatory  environment  in  a 
variety of ways including increased levels of inflam-
matory proteins such as IL-6 and TNF-α. In terms 
of  impact  on  survival  with  cancer,  data  primarily 
from breast cancer suggest that obesity is associated 
with decreased survival likely due, at least in part, to 
the impact of obesity on hormonal factors in devel-
opment of certain breast cancers, although this may 
be limited to subsets of breast cancer patients. Some 
studies  have  suggested,  paradoxically,  that  obesity 
may be associated with improved survival in some 
patients such as those with advanced-stage colorec-
tal  cancer.  Clearly,  the  biology  of  the  association 
between obesity and cancer and its impact on dis-
ease outcome is complex, and additional studies are 
necessary to better define the mechanisms involved.

FIGURE  72-9  Tumor  angiogenesis  is  a  complex  process  involving  many  different  cell  types  that  must 
proliferate, migrate, invade, and differentiate in response to signals from the tumor microenvironment. 
Endothelial cells (ECs) sprout from host vessels in response to VEGF, bFGF, Ang2, and other proangiogenic 
stimuli.  Sprouting  is  stimulated  by  VEGF/VEGFR2,  Ang2/Tie-2,  and  integrin/extracellular  matrix  (ECM) 
interactions.  Bone  marrow–derived  circulating  endothelial  precursors  (CEPs)  migrate  to  the  tumor  in 
response to VEGF and differentiate into ECs, while hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into leukocytes, 
including  tumor-associated  macrophages  that  secrete  angiogenic  growth  factors  and  produce  matrix 
metalloproteinases  (MMPs)  that  remodel  the  ECM  and  release  bound  growth  factors.  Tumor  cells 
themselves may directly form parts of vascular channels within tumors. The pattern of vessel formation is 
haphazard: vessels are tortuous, dilated, leaky, and branch in random ways. This leads to uneven blood 
flow  within  the  tumor,  with  areas  of  acidosis  and  hypoxemia  (which  stimulate  release  of  angiogenic 
factors) and high intratumoral pressures that inhibit delivery of therapeutic agents.

 ■ MECHANISMS OF TUMOR VESSEL FORMATION
One  of  the  critical  elements  of  tumor  cell  proliferation  is  delivery  of 
oxygen,  nutrients,  and  circulating  factors  important  for  growth  and 
survival.  Thus,  a  critical  element  in  growth  of  primary  tumors  and 
formation of metastatic sites is the angiogenic switch: the ability of the 
tumor  to  promote  the  formation  of  new  blood  vessels,  including  the 
recruitment of vascular endothelial cells (ECs). The angiogenic switch 
is  a  phase  in  tumor  development  when  the  dynamic  balance  of  pro- 
and antiangiogenic factors is tipped in favor of vessel formation by the 
effects of the tumor on its immediate environment. Stimuli for tumor 
angiogenesis include hypoxemia, inflammation, and genetic lesions in 
oncogenes or tumor suppressors that alter tumor cell gene expression. 
Angiogenesis consists of several steps, including the stimulation of ECs 
by growth factors, degradation of the ECM by proteases, proliferation 
and  migration  of  ECs  into  the  tumor,  and  the  eventual  formation  of 
new capillary tubes.

Tumors  use  a  number  of  mechanisms  to  promote  vascularization, 
subverting normal angiogenic processes for this purpose (Fig. 72-9). 
Primary or metastatic tumor cells sometimes arise in proximity to host 
blood vessels and grow around these vessels, parasitizing nutrients by 
co-opting the local blood supply. However, most tumor blood vessels 
arise  by  the  process  of  sprouting,  in  which  tumors  secrete  trophic 
angiogenic molecules, the most potent being VEGFs, that induce the 
proliferation and migration of host ECs into the tumor. Sprouting in 
normal and pathogenic angiogenesis is regulated by three families of 
transmembrane  RTKs  expressed  on  ECs  and  their  ligands  (VEGFs, 
angiopoietins, ephrins; Fig. 72-10), which are produced by tumor cells, 
inflammatory cells, or stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.

Central  to  the  angiogenic  response  are  hypoxia-inducible  factors 
(HIFs; especially 1 and 2), which are transcription factors that normally, 
in response to hypoxia, stimulate the transcription of a large number of 
genes responsive to hypoxia, including genes involved in metabolism as

FIGURE 72-10  Critical molecular determinants of endothelial cell biology. Angiogenic endothelium expresses 
a number of receptors not found on resting endothelium. These include receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and 
integrins that bind to the extracellular matrix and mediate endothelial cell (EC) adhesion, migration, and invasion. 
ECs also express RTKs (i.e., the fibroblast growth factor [FGF] and platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF] receptors) 
that  are  found  on  many  other  cell  types.  Critical  functions  mediated  by  activated  RTK  include  proliferation, 
migration, and enhanced survival of endothelial cells, as well as regulation of the recruitment of perivascular 
cells and bloodborne circulating endothelial precursors and hematopoietic stem cells to the tumor. Intracellular 
signaling via EC-specific RTK utilizes molecular pathways that may be targets for future antiangiogenic therapies.

and  prevents  the  vascular  permeability  nor-
mally  induced  by  VEGF  and  inflammatory 
cytokines.

For  tumor  cell–derived  VEGF  to  initiate 
sprouting from host vessels, the stability con-
ferred by the Ang1/Tie2 pathway must be per-
turbed;  this  occurs  by  the  secretion  of  Ang2 
by  ECs  that  are  undergoing  active  remodel-
ing. Ang2 binds to Tie2 and is a competitive 
inhibitor of Ang1 action: under the influence 
of  Ang2,  preexisting  blood  vessels  become 
more  responsive  to  remodeling  signals,  with 
less  adherence  of  ECs  to  stroma  and  associ-
ated  perivascular  cells  and  more  responsive-
ness to VEGF. Therefore, Ang2 is required at 
early stages of tumor angiogenesis for desta-
bilizing  the  vasculature  by  making  host  ECs 
more  sensitive  to  angiogenic  signals.  In  the 
presence of Ang2, there is no stabilization by 
the  Ang1/Tie2  interaction,  and  tumor  blood 
vessels are leaky, hemorrhagic, and have poor 
association  of  ECs  with  underlying  stroma. 
Sprouting  tumor  ECs  express  high  levels  of 
the  transmembrane  protein  ephrin-B2  and 
its  receptor,  the  RTK  EPH,  whose  signaling 
appears to work with the angiopoietins during 
vessel  remodeling.  During  embryogenesis, 
EPH receptors are expressed on the endothe-
lium  of  primordial  venous  vessels  while  the 
transmembrane ligand ephrin-B2 is expressed 
by cells of primordial arteries; the reciprocal 
expression  may  regulate  differentiation  and 
patterning of the vasculature.

well as angiogenesis. HIF1 has a bigger role in stimulating metabolism 
(glycogenesis), whereas HIF2 plays a bigger role in angiogenesis. HIF 
protein function can also be enhanced in a number of ways in cancer 
not involving hypoxia, including mutations in the von Hippel–Lindau 
tumor suppressor gene (an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls HIF levels 
by targeting it for degradation), such as occurs in some RCCs. Among 
the genes stimulated by HIF are VEGF and VEGF receptors. VEGFs 
and their receptors are required for embryonic vasculogenesis (devel-
opment of new blood vessels when none preexist) and normal (wound 
healing, corpus luteum formation) and pathologic angiogenesis (tumor 
angiogenesis, inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis). 
VEGF-A is a heparin-binding glycoprotein with at least four isoforms 
(splice  variants)  that  regulates  blood  vessel  formation  by  binding  to 
the  RTKs  VEGFR1  and  VEGFR2,  which  are  expressed  on  all  ECs  in 
addition to a subset of hematopoietic cells (Fig. 72-9). VEGFR2 plays a 
more direct role in regulating EC proliferation, migration, and survival, 
whereas VEGFR1 appears to have more nuanced functions with a less 
direct role in stimulating EC processes in the normal adult (even acting 
as  a  decoy  protein  for  VEGFA  to  decrease  binding  to  VEGFR2)  but 
with important effects during embryogenesis and on tumor angiogen-
esis. Tumor vessels may be more dependent on VEGFR signaling for 
growth and survival than normal ECs.

While  VEGF  signaling  is  a  critical  initiator  of  angiogenesis,  this 
is  a  complex  process  regulated  by  additional  signaling  pathways  
(Fig. 72-10). The angiopoietin, Ang1, produced by stromal cells, binds 
to  the  EC  RTK  Tie-2  and  promotes  the  interaction  of  ECs  with  the 
ECM  and  perivascular  cells,  such  as  pericytes  and  smooth-muscle 
cells, to form tight, nonleaky vessels. PDGF and basic fibroblast growth 
factor (bFGF) help to recruit these perivascular cells. Ang1 is required 
for  maintaining  the  quiescence  and  stability  of  mature  blood  vessels 

A  number  of  additional  ubiquitously 
expressed host molecules play critical roles in 
normal  and  pathologic  angiogenesis.  Proan-
giogenic  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  growth 
factors  secreted  by  stromal  cells  or  inflam-
matory  cells  make  important  contributions 
to  neovascularization,  including  bFGF,  transforming  growth  factor-β 
(TGF-β), TNF-α, and IL-8. In contrast to normal endothelium, angio-
genic endothelium overexpresses specific members of the integrin family 
of ECM-binding proteins that mediate EC adhesion, migration, and sur-
vival. Specifically, expression of integrins αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 medi-
ates  spreading  and  migration  of  ECs  and  is  required  for  angiogenesis 
induced by VEGF and bFGF, which in turn can upregulate EC integrin 
expression. The αvβ3 integrin physically associates with VEGFR2 in the 
plasma membrane and promotes signal transduction from each recep-
tor  to  promote  EC  proliferation  (via  focal  adhesion  kinase,  src,  PI3K, 
and other pathways) and survival (by inhibition of p53 and increasing 
the  Bcl-2/Bax  expression  ratio).  In  addition,  αvβ3  forms  cell-surface 
complexes  with  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs),  zinc-requiring 
proteases that cleave ECM proteins, leading to enhanced EC migration 
and the release of heparin-binding growth factors, including VEGF and 
bFGF. EC adhesion molecules can be upregulated (i.e., by VEGF, TNF-
α) or downregulated (by TGF-β); this, together with chaotic blood flow, 
explains poor leukocyte-endothelial interactions in tumor blood vessels 
and may help tumor cells avoid immune surveillance.

Tumor blood vessels are not normal; they have chaotic architecture 
and blood flow. Due to an imbalance of angiogenic regulators such as 
VEGFs and angiopoietins (see below), tumor vessels are tortuous and 
dilated  with  an  uneven  diameter,  excessive  branching,  and  shunting. 
Tumor  blood  flow  is  variable,  with  areas  of  hypoxemia  and  acidosis 
leading  to  the  selection  of  variants  that  are  resistant  to  hypoxemia- 
induced apoptosis (often involving the loss of p53 expression). Tumor 
vessel walls have numerous openings, widened interendothelial junc-
tions, and discontinuous or absent basement membrane. This contrib-
utes to the high permeability of these vessels and, together with lack 
of  functional  intratumoral  lymphatics,  causes  increased  interstitial

pattern that delivers blood to tissues in a spatially and temporally efficient manner to meet the metabolic needs of the tissue (top). At the microscopic level, tight junctions 
are maintained between endothelial cells (ECs), which are adherent to a thick and evenly distributed basement membrane (BM). Pericytes form a surrounding layer that 
provides trophic signals to the EC and helps maintain proper vessel tone. Vascular permeability is regulated, interstitial fluid pressure (IP) is low, and oxygen tension and 
pH are physiologic. B. Tumors have abnormal vessels with tortuous branching and dilated, irregular interconnecting branches, causing uneven blood flow with areas of 
hypoxemia and acidosis. This harsh environment selects genetic events that result in resistant tumor variants, such as the loss of p53. High levels of VEGF (secreted by 
tumor cells) disrupt gap junction communication, tight junctions, and adherens junctions between EC via src-mediated phosphorylation of proteins such as connexin 43, 
zonula occludens-1, VE-cadherin, and α/β-catenins. Tumor vessels have thin, irregular BM, and pericytes are sparse or absent. Together, these molecular abnormalities 
result in a vasculature that is permeable to serum macromolecules, leading to high tumor interstitial pressure, which can prevent the delivery of drugs to the tumor cells. 
This is made worse by the binding and activation of platelets at sites of exposed BM, with release of stored VEGF and microvessel clot formation, creating more abnormal 
blood flow and regions of hypoxemia. C. In experimental systems, treatment with bevacizumab or blocking antibodies to VEGFR2 leads to changes in the tumor vasculature 
that have been termed vessel normalization. During the first week of treatment, abnormal vessels are eliminated or pruned (dotted lines), leaving a more normal branching 
pattern. ECs partially regain features such as cell-cell junctions, adherence to a more normal BM, and pericyte coverage. These changes lead to a decrease in vascular 
permeability, reduced interstitial pressure, and a transient increase in blood flow within the tumor. Note that in murine models, this normalization period lasts only for ~5–6 
days. D. After continued anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy (which is often combined with chemo- or radiotherapy), ECs die, leading to tumor cell death (either due to direct effects 
of the chemotherapy or lack of blood flow).

pressure  within  the  tumor  (which  also  interferes  with  the  delivery 
of  therapeutics  to  the  tumor;  Figs.  72-9,  72-10,  and  72-11).  Tumor 
blood vessels have a deficit of perivascular cells such as pericytes and 
smooth-muscle cells that normally regulate flow in response to tissue 
metabolic needs.

Unlike  normal  blood  vessels,  the  vascular  lining  of  tumor  vessels 
is  not  a  homogeneous  layer  of  ECs  but  often  consists  of  a  mosaic  of 
ECs and tumor cells, which, because of their plasticity, can upregulate 
expression  of  genes  normally  only  seen  in  ECs  under  hypoxic  con-
ditions.  These  cancer  cell–derived  vascular  channels,  which  may  be

lined by ECM secreted by the tumor cells, are referred to as vascular 
mimicry. During tumor angiogenesis, ECs are highly proliferative and 
express a number of plasma membrane proteins that are characteris-
tic  of  activated  endothelium,  including  growth  factor  receptors  and 
adhesion  molecules  such  as  integrins.  These  abnormalities  in  tumor 
vasculature  provide  potential  differential  sensitivities  from  normal 
vessels  to  approaches  to  inhibit  the  process,  allowing  for  the  use  of 
antiangiogenic agents in cancer treatment.

Lymphatic vessels also exist within tumors. Development of tumor 
lymphatics  is  associated  with  expression  of  VEGFR3  and  its  ligands 
VEGF-C and VEGF-D. The role of these vessels in tumor cell metas-
tasis  to  regional  lymph  nodes  remains  to  be  determined.  However, 
VEGF-C levels correlate significantly with metastasis to regional lymph 
nodes in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers.

 ■ ANTIANGIOGENIC THERAPY
Angiogenesis  inhibitors  function  by  targeting  the  critical  molecular 
pathways  involved  in  EC  proliferation,  migration,  and/or  survival, 
many  of  which  are  highly  expressed  in  the  activated  endothelium  in 
tumors. Inhibition of growth factor and adhesion-dependent signaling 
pathways  can  induce  EC  apoptosis  with  concomitant  inhibition  of 
tumor growth. Different types of tumors can use distinct combinations 
of molecular mechanisms to activate the angiogenic switch. Therefore, 
it  is  doubtful  that  a  single  antiangiogenic  strategy  will  suffice  for  all 
human cancers; rather, a number of agents or combinations of agents 
will be needed, depending on distinct programs of angiogenesis used 
by  different  human  cancers.  Despite  this,  experimental  data  indicate 
that  for  some  tumor  types,  blockade  of  a  single  growth  factor  (e.g., 
VEGF) may inhibit tumor-induced vascular growth.

Bevacizumab, an antibody that binds VEGF, potentiates the effects 
of  a  number  of  different  types  of  active  chemotherapeutic  regimens 

used to treat a variety of different tumor types including colon, lung, 
ovarian, and cervical cancers. It also has activity in combination with 
interferon  against  RCCs  and  alone  for  glioblastomas.  Other  protein 
inhibitors  of  the  VEGF  signaling  pathway  approved  for  anticancer 
therapy include ramucirumab (a monoclonal antibody directed against 
VEGFR2,  approved  for  use  against  gastric/gastroesophageal,  colon, 
and lung cancers) and ziv-aflibercept (a recombinant protein inhibitor 
of  VEGF,  approved  for  colorectal  cancer).  Hypertension  is  the  most 
common side effect of inhibitors of VEGF (or its receptors) but can be 
treated with antihypertensive agents and uncommonly requires discon-
tinuation  of  therapy.  Rare  but  serious  potential  risks  include  arterial 
thromboembolic  events,  including  stroke  and  myocardial  infarction, 
hemorrhage, bowel perforation, and inhibition of wound healing.

Several  small-molecule  inhibitors  (SMIs)  that  target  VEGF  RTK 
activity but are also inhibitory to other kinases have also been approved 
to treat certain cancers. Sunitinib (see above and Table 72-2) has activ-
ity  directed  against  mutant  c-Kit  receptors  (approved  for  GIST),  but 
also  targets  VEGFR  and  PDGFR,  and  has  antitumor  activity  against 
pancreatic  neuroendocrine  and  metastatic  RCCs,  presumably  on  the 
basis of its antiangiogenic activity. Similarly, sorafenib, originally devel-
oped as a Raf kinase inhibitor but with potent activity against VEGFR 
and PDGFR, has activity against RCC, differentiated thyroid and hepa-
tocellular cancers, and desmoid tumors. A closely related molecule to 
sorafenib, regorafenib, has activity against colorectal cancer, GIST, and 
hepatocellular cancer. Other inhibitors of the VEGF pathway approved 
for the treatment of various cancers include axitinib, pazopanib, lenva-
tinib, and cabozantinib.

The  success  in  targeting  tumor  angiogenesis  has  led  to  enhanced 
enthusiasm  for  the  development  of  drugs  that  target  other  aspects 
of  the  angiogenic  process;  some  of  these  therapeutic  approaches  are 
outlined  in  Fig.  72-12.  Recently,  an  inhibitor  of  HIF2-α  has  shown

FIGURE 72-12  Knowledge of the molecular events governing tumor angiogenesis has led to a number of therapeutic strategies to block tumor blood vessel formation. 
The successful therapeutic targeting of VEGF and its receptors VEGFR is described in the text. Other endothelial cell–specific receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (e.g., 
angiopoietin/Tie2 and ephrin/EPH) are likely targets for the future. Ligation of the αvβ3 integrin is required for EC survival. Integrins are also required for EC migration and 
are important regulators of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, which modulates EC movement through the ECM as well as release of bound growth factors. Targeting 
of integrins includes development of blocking antibodies, small peptide inhibitors of integrin signaling, and arg-gly-asp–containing peptides that prevent integrin:ECM 
binding. Peptides derived from normal proteins by proteolytic cleavage, including endostatin and tumstatin, inhibit angiogenesis by mechanisms that include interfering 
with integrin function. Signal transduction pathways that are dysregulated in tumor cells indirectly regulate EC function. Inhibition of EGF-family receptors, whose signaling 
activity is upregulated in a number of human cancers (e.g., breast, colon, and lung cancers), results in downregulation of VEGF and IL-8, while increasing expression of the 
antiangiogenic protein thrombospondin-1. The Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and Src kinase pathways constitute important antitumor targets that also regulate the proliferation 
and survival of tumor-derived EC. The discovery that ECs from normal tissues express tissue-specific “vascular addressins” on their cell surface suggests that targeting 
specific EC subsets may be possible.

trial.  There  is  also  evidence  suggesting  potential  enhanced  activity 
when anti-VEGF agents are used in combination with immunomodu-
lators including immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, it is not yet 
known whether this will produce a clinically meaningful enhancement 
of antitumor activity.

 ■ EVASION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BY CANCERS
The  immune  system  plays  a  critical  role  in  maintaining  organismal 
integrity including by defending against pathogens as well as prevent-
ing and limiting the growth of cancers. There is a complex interaction 
between cancer and the host from the development of the first malig-
nant  cell  to  the  establishment  of  a  clinical  cancer  and  its  subsequent 
growth, invasion, and metastasis. The immune system plays a critical 
role in the prevention of cancer development. This is exemplified by the 
increased risk for cancer development in individuals who are signifi-
cantly immunosuppressed, such as by inherited defects in mechanisms 
important for immune function, the immunosuppression necessary to 
maintain  allogeneic  organ  transplants,  and  immunosuppression  seen 
from certain infections such as human immunodeficiency virus. There 
are two components of the immune system. The first is innate immu-
nity (present in the organism and not dependent on prior exposure to a 
specific antigen, such as those present in a pathogen or malignant cell), 
which tends to be general and not specific. The second is the adaptive 
immune  component,  which  depends  on  the  innate  immune  compo-
nent for activation and provides the specificity to the response with sig-
nificant expansion of cells to target the specific antigens present on the 
pathogen or malignant cell. Thus, while the innate process provides the 
first line of defense, the adaptive process is necessary for the specificity 
of response and providing memory to more rapidly attack cells should 
the pathogen infection recur or the malignant cells grow. The immune 
system has to be tightly regulated to allow for clearance of unwanted 
antigens while preventing an immune-mediated attack on the self. (See 
Chap. 349 for details on the function of the immune system).

Not  surprisingly,  since  cancers  arise  from  normal  cells  within  the 
body  that  have  a  variety  of  processes  to  prevent  destruction  by  the 
immune system, they have a variety of mechanisms that allow them to 
evade detection and elimination by the immune system (Fig. 72-13). 
These  include  downregulation  of  cell  surface  proteins  involved  in 

immune  recognition  (including  MHC  proteins  and  tumor-specific 
antigens), expression of other cell surface proteins that inhibit immune 
function  (including  members  of  the  B7  family  of  proteins  such  as 
PD-L1), secretion of proteins and other molecules that are immunosup-
pressive, recruitment and expansion of immunosuppressive cells such 
as  regulatory  T  cells  (which  are  important  for  maintaining  tolerance 
against self-antigens), induction of T cell tolerance, and downregulation 
of  death  receptors  (Fig.  72.14).  Due  to  the  marked  heterogeneity  of 
cells within a cancer, a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms are 
continuously  occurring  and  changing.  In  addition,  the  inflammatory 
effects  of  some  of  the  immune  mediator  cells  in  the  tumor  microen-
vironment  (especially  tissue-associated  macrophages  and  myeloid- 
derived suppressor cells) can suppress T cell responses to the tumor as 
well as stimulate inflammation that can enhance tumor growth.

There  are  marked  differences  in  the  way  different  malignancies 
respond to current immunotherapeutic approaches. For example, mel-
anomas,  RCC,  Merkel  cell  carcinomas,  cancers  with  defects  in  DNA 
repair  associated  with  microsatellite  instability  with  accumulation  of 
gene mutations, and lymphomas respond well to current immunother-
apeutic approaches, whereas pancreatic and microsatellite-stable colon 
cancers  do  not.  While  there  is  not  a  complete  understanding  of  why 
these differences exist and there are many factors both within the can-
cer cells and in the microenvironment that play a role, several factors 
have  been  identified  that  appear  to  be  important.  These  include  the 
number of mutations present in the tumor (tumor mutational burden), 
presence  of  new  or  neoantigens,  expression  of  immune  checkpoint 
proteins (e.g., PD-L1 for anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy), density of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and host genetic factors. One of these 
(PD-L1  expression  by  the  tumor)  has  sufficient  predictive  value  for 
certain tumors (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer) to be used in making 
treatment  decisions  regarding  the  use  of  antibodies  targeting  PD-1 
or PD-L1. However, neither PD-L1 expression nor any other marker 
can predict responsiveness of most tumors to immunotherapy. Better 
biomarkers that define potential responsiveness of specific cancers to 
immunotherapy are badly needed. A major area of research is to try to 
identify approaches that would convert cancers that are not responsive 
to immunotherapy to being responsive.

Immunotherapy  approaches  to  treat  cancer  can  be  divided  into 
those aimed at activating the immune response and those designed to

release the brakes that prevent an effective immune response against 
tumors. Approaches at activating the immune response against cancer 
including  using  immunostimulatory  molecules  such  as  interferons, 
IL-2, and especially monoclonal antibodies have had some success.

A more direct approach to enhance the activity of T cells directed 
against  specific  tumors  involves  isolating  T  cells  from  patients  and 
re-engineering the cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T 
cells)  that  recognize  antigens  present  on  the  cells  of  that  individu-
al’s  tumor.  The  most  commonly  used  approach  to  date  has  been  to 
engineer the cells to express receptors targeting the CD19 antigen on 
acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) cells. These have been shown to have significant antitumor 
activity in the treatment of patients with ALL and DLBCL, including 
durable  remissions  in  patients  refractory  to  standard  therapies,  and 
are  approved  for  these  malignancies.  However,  there  have  also  been 
significant  issues  with  toxicity  including  cytokine  release  syndrome, 
organ toxicity felt to be due to inadvertent targeting of antigens present 
in the organ, and neurotoxicity. These patients often require aggressive 
supportive care by individuals experienced in the delivery of CAR-T 
cells. In addition, as is true for most anticancer therapies, mechanisms 
of resistance have developed, most commonly the outgrowth of tumor 
cells  no  longer  expressing  the  antigen.  Mechanisms  for  preventing 
the development of resistant cells are being explored. CAR-T cells are 
undergoing clinical investigation against other hematologic malignan-
cies (e.g., multiple myeloma) and solid tumors. Approaches to develop 
allogeneic CAR-T-cell therapies are also being explored.

The other approach to enhancing the immune response against can-
cers is releasing the brakes that inhibit a response by targeting of pro-
teins or cells (e.g., regulatory T cells) involved in normal homeostatic 
control to prevent autoimmune damage to the host but that malignant 
cells and their stroma can also utilize to inhibit the immune response 
directed against them. The approach that is furthest along clinically 
has  involved  targeting  CTLA-4,  PD-1,  and  PD-L1  (and  others)—co- 
inhibitory molecules that are expressed on the surface of cancer cells, 
cells  of  the  immune  system,  and/or  stromal  cells  and  are  involved 
in  inhibiting  the  immune  response  against  cancer  (Figs.  72-13  and  
72-14). This approach has had clinical activity against a variety of can-
cers. A monoclonal antibody directed against CTLA-4 is approved for 
the treatment of melanoma, and antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 
are  approved  for  use  against  many  cancers,  including  melanoma, 
RCC, lung cancer (both non-small-cell lung and small-cell lung), head 
and  neck  cancer,  urothelial  cancer,  cervical  cancer,  hepatocellular 
carcinoma,  gastric  cancer,  esophageal  cancer,  microsatellite  instabil-
ity  (MSI)-high  cancers,  cancers  with  high  tumor  mutational  burden 

(TMB), Merkel cell cancer, primary B-cell mediastinal lymphoma, and 
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma.  They  continue  to  be  evaluated  against  other 
malignancies as well. The combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 
antibodies  has  been  approved  for  treatment  of  a  number  of  cancers 
including  melanoma,  RCC,  lung  cancer,  pleural  mesothelioma,  and 
MSI-high metastatic colorectal cancers. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
are being used singly, in pairs, and in combination with chemotherapy 
in  many  ongoing  clinical  trials.  Specific  determinants  of  response  to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors are still being defined, but in addition 
to high PD-L1 expression, the presence of increased neoantigens in the 
tumor, such as seen in patients with MSI-high and TMB-high cancers, 
may be one important determinant of better responses.

A number of other proteins are involved in controlling the immune 
response  (both  ones  that  enhance  activity  [e.g.,  CD27  and  CD40] 
as  well  as  ones  involved  in  inhibiting  response  [e.g.,  LAG3,  TIM-3,  
TIGIT]).  Antibodies  have  been  developed  to  modulate  function  of 
these proteins, and many are in clinical development for cancer ther-
apy. In addition, various combinations targeting more than one protein 
involved  in  potentially  enhancing  the  immune  response  against  can-
cers or with other anticancer approaches (targeted agents, chemother-
apy,  radiation  therapy)  that  may  lead  to  enhanced  antitumor  activity 
are  also  being  explored.  An  important  aspect  of  these  approaches  is 
balancing  sufficient  release  of  the  negative  control  of  the  immune 
response  to  allow  immune-mediated  attack  on  the  tumors  while  not 
allowing too much of an immune response against normal tissues and 
thus inducing severe autoimmune effects (e.g., against lung, liver, skin, 
thyroid,  pituitary  gland,  or  the  gastrointestinal  tract).  As  is  true  for 
other immunotherapeutic approaches against cancer, major efforts are 
ongoing to better understand the mechanism of immune toxicity from 
these  approaches  and,  therefore,  ways  of  controlling  this  while  not 
abrogating the antitumor effects.

Improved knowledge of the biology of the interactions between the 
immune  system  and  cancers  continues  to  be  rapid  with  the  promise 
for  additional  significant  improvements  in  use  of  immunotherapy  to 
treat cancer.

SUMMARY
Although  each  of  the  biological  aspects  of  cancers  and  examples  of 
targeting them has been addressed individually, clearly there is com-
plicated cross-talk between these that occurs in all cancers that needs 
to be better understood to optimally treat different cancers. The explo-
sion of information on tumor cell biology, metastasis, and tumor-host 
interactions  (including  angiogenesis,  other  tumor-stromal  interactions, 
and immune evasion by tumors) has ushered in a new era of rational 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   528

PART 4Oncology and Hematologytargeted  therapy  for  cancer.  Furthermore,  it  has  become  clear  that 
specific molecular factors detected in individual tumors (specific gene 
mutations,  gene  expression  profiles,  miRNA  expression,  overexpres-
sion of specific proteins) can be used to tailor therapy and maximize 
antitumor  effects.  Potentially  of  greater  impact  on  decreasing  deaths 
from  cancer,  better  understanding  of  the  biology  of  early  cancer 
development and technologic development to improve sensitivity and 
specificity in detecting cancer-specific molecules (e.g., mutated genes) 
provide  hope  that  approaches  for  earlier  detection  of  cancer  can  be 
developed.

73 Principles of Cancer 
Treatment
Edward A. Sausville, Dan L. Longo

CANCER PRESENTATION
Localized  or  systemic  cancer  is  frequent  in  the  differential  diagnosis 
of  a  variety  of  common  complaints.  Affording  patients  the  greatest 
opportunity for cure or meaningful prolongation of life is greatly aided 
by cancer diagnosis early in its natural history. The spectrum of pos-
sible cancer-related interventions to make cure possible are shown in 
Table 73-1.
 ■ DETECTION OF A CANCER
The  term  cancer,  as  used  here,  is  synonymous  with  the  term  tumor, 
whose  original  derivation  from  Latin  simply  meant  “swelling,”  not 
otherwise  specified.  Swelling  reflects  increased  interstitial  fluid  pres-
sure  and  increased  cellular  and  stromal  mass,  compared  to  normal 
tissue.  Leukemias,  a  cancer  of  the  blood-forming  tissues,  presents  in 
a  disseminated  form  frequently  without  tumor  masses.  Tumors  can 
also present by organ dysfunction, such as dyspnea on exertion from 
anemia  caused  by  leukemia  replacing  normal  marrow,  cough  from 
lung cancers, jaundice from tumors blocking bile ducts, or neurologic 
signs from gliomas. Hemorrhage frequently results from involvement

of  hollow  viscera,  but  also  may  reflect  altered  platelet  number  or 
blood  coagulation.  Tumors  may  also  present  with  a  “paraneoplastic 
syndrome”  owing  to  the  effects  of  substances  they  secrete.  Although 
statistically the fraction of patients with cancer underlying a particular 
presenting sign or symptom may be low, the implications of missing an 
early-stage tumor call for vigilance in considering cancer as the basis 
for persistent signs or symptoms.

Evidence  of  a  tumor’s  existence  can  come  from  careful  physical 
examination,  e.g.,  enlarged  lymph  nodes  in  lymphomas  or  palpable 
mass  in  a  breast  or  soft  tissue  site.  A  mass  may  also  be  detected  or 
confirmed  by  an  imaging  modality,  such  as  plain  x-ray,  computed 
tomography  (CT)  scan,  ultrasound,  positron  emission  tomography 
(PET) imaging, or nuclear magnetic resonance approaches. Endoscopy 
may directly visualize a tumor.
 ■ ESTABLISHING A CANCER DIAGNOSIS
Once  a  potential  tumor  is  defined,  establishing  the  diagnosis  is  the 
next step in the intervention spectrum. This requires a biopsy proce-
dure in most circumstances and pathologic confirmation that cancer 
is present; very rarely, where biopsy would be definitely injurious and 
imaging  modalities  are  unequivocal,  such  as  with  a  likely  brainstem 
glioma,  treatment  might  be  reasonably  considered  based  on  clinical 
and imaging evidence without biopsy. In addition to light microscopy, 
biopsied tissue also allows definition of genetic abnormalities and pro-
tein expression patterns (Table 73-2).

The extent of specialized testing needs to be tailored to an individual 
patient’s  case.  Global  DNA  sequencing  of  genes  expressed  in  tumors 
has not been shown to convey conclusive advantage in terms of sur-
vival.  But  the  aggregate  “mutational  burden”  present  in  tumors  and 
the intactness of DNA repair genes (e.g., breast cancer susceptibility 1 
and 2 [BRCA1/2], microsatellite instability, homologous recombination 
pathway–associated genes) may suggest valuable treatment courses in 
tumors  without  curative  potential.  Testing  for  certain  abnormalities 
in Table 73-2 can be the basis for use of specific U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic agents.

Optimally,  an  excisional  biopsy  occurs,  in  which  the  entire  tumor 
mass is removed with a margin of normal tissue surrounding it. If an 
excisional biopsy cannot be performed, incisional biopsy is the proce-
dure of second choice: a wedge of tissue is removed, trying to include 
the  majority  of  the  cross-sectional  diameter  to  minimize  sampling 
error.  Biopsy  techniques  that  involve  cutting  into  tumor  risk  facili-
tating  the  spread  of  the  tumor,  and  consideration  with  a  surgeon  of 
whether the biopsy approach is a potential prelude to a curative surgery

accounting for possible diagnoses may best inform the approach taken. 
Core-needle biopsy usually obtains considerably less tissue but can pro-
vide information to plan a treatment. Fine-needle aspiration generally 
yields a suspension of cells from a mass. If positive for cancer, it may 
allow  inception  of  systemic  treatment,  or  it  can  provide  a  basis  for 
planning a more extensive surgical procedure. It is unreliable as a sole 
diagnostic method to make a cancer diagnosis in most cases. A “nega-
tive” fine-needle aspiration cannot be taken as definitive evidence that 
a tumor is absent. In some instances, features of diagnostic imaging are 
sufficient to make a reliable diagnosis without obtaining tissue, usually 

with presence of a tumor associated circulating diagnostic marker, e.g., 
alpha fetoprotein in hepatocellular carcinoma.

 ■ CANCER STAGING
An essential component of correct patient management in many cancer 
types is defining the extent of disease to determine whether localized 
treatments,  “combined-modality”  approaches,  or  systemic  treatments 
should  initially  be  considered.  Radiographic  and  other  imaging  tests 
can  be  helpful  in  defining  the  clinical  stage;  pathologic  staging  doc-
uments  the  histologic  presence  of  tumor  in  tissue  biopsies  obtained 
through a surgical procedure. Lymph node sampling in breast cancer, 
melanoma,  lung,  head  and  neck,  colon,  and  other  intra-abdominal 
cancers may provide crucial information.

Staging  systems  have  evolved  to  define  a  “T”  component  related 
to  the  size  of  the  tumor  or  its  invasion  into  local  structures,  an  “N” 
component  related  to  the  number  and  nature  of  lymph  node  groups 
adjacent  to  the  tumor  with  evidence  of  tumor  spread,  and  an  “M” 
component, based on the presence of local or distant metastatic sites. 
The various TNM components are then aggregated to stages, usually 
stage  I  to  III  or  IV,  depending  on  the  anatomic  site.  The  numerical 
stages  reflect  similar  long-term  survival  outcomes  of  the  aggregated 
TNM  groupings  in  a  numeric  stage  after  treatment  tailored  to  the 
stage. In general, stage I tumors are T1 (reflecting small size), N0 or 
N1 (reflecting no or minimal node spread), and M0 (no metastases). 
Such early-stage tumors are usually amenable to curative approaches 
with local treatments. On the other hand, stage IV tumors have metas-
tasized to distant sites or locally invaded viscera in a nonresectable way. 
They are treated with palliative intent, except for those diseases with 
exceptional sensitivity to systemic treatments such as chemotherapy or 
immunotherapy. Also, the TNM staging system is not useful in diseases 
such as leukemia, where bone marrow infiltration is never localized, or 
central nervous system (CNS) tumors, where tumor histology and the 
extent of feasible resection are more important in driving prognosis.

CANCER TREATMENT
The  goal  of  cancer  treatment  is  first  to  eradicate  the  cancer;  if  not 
possible,  the  goal  shifts  to  palliation:  amelioration  of  symptoms  and 
preservation of quality of life while striving to extend life. When cure 
of cancer is possible, cancer treatments may be undertaken despite the 
certainty of severe toxicities, and these may produce toxicity with no 
benefit. Conversely, when the clinical goal is palliation, careful atten-
tion  to  minimizing  the  toxicity  of  treatments  becomes  a  significant 
goal.

Cancer  treatments  are  divided  into  two  main  types:  local  and  sys-
temic.  Local  treatments  include  surgery,  radiation  therapy  (including 
photodynamic  therapy),  and  ablative  approaches,  including  radiofre-
quency and thermal or cryosurgical approaches. Systemic treatments 
include  chemotherapy  (including  hormonal  therapy  and  molecular 
targeted  therapy)  and  biologic  therapy  (including  immunotherapy). 
The modalities are often used in combination. Oncology, the study of 
tumors  including  treatment  approaches,  is  a  multidisciplinary  effort 
with surgical, radiation, and internal medicine–related areas of onco-
logic expertise.

Normal  organs  and  cancers  share  the  property  of  having  a  popu-
lation  of  cells  actively  progressing  through  the  cell  cycle,  with  their 
division providing a basis for organ or tumor growth, and a population 
of  cells  not  in  cycle;  these  include  stem  cells,  whose  properties  are 
being elucidated. Cancer stem cells serve as a basis for tumor initiating 
or  repopulating  cells.  Tumors  follow  a  Gompertzian  growth  curve  
(Fig.  73-1),  with  the  growth  fraction  of  a  neoplasm  high  with  small 
tumor  burdens  and  declining  until,  at  the  time  of  diagnosis,  with  a 
tumor burden of 1–5 × 109 tumor cells, the growth fraction is usually 
1–4% for many solid tumors. By this view, the most rapid growth rate 
occurs  before  the  tumor  is  detectable.  An  alternative  explanation  for 
such  growth  properties  may  also  emerge  from  the  ability  of  tumors 
at metastatic sites to recruit circulating tumor cells from the primary 
tumor  or  other  metastases.  Key  features  of  tumor  growth  are  the 
ability to stimulate new supporting stroma through angiogenesis and 
ingrowth of fibroblasts and immune cells (Chap. 72).

FIGURE 73-1  Gompertzian tumor growth. The growth fraction of a tumor declines 
exponentially  over  time  (top),  peaking  before  it  is  clinically  detectable  (middle). 
Tumor size increases slowly, goes through an exponential phase, and slows again 
as  the  tumor  has  limitation  of  nutrients  or  host  regulatory  influences  occur.  The 
maximum growth rate occurs at 1/e, the point at which the tumor is about 37% of its 
maximum size (marked with an X). Tumor becomes detectable at a burden of about 
109 (1 cm3) cells and kills the patient at a tumor cell burden of about 1012 (1 kg).

LOCALIZED CANCER TREATMENTS
 ■ SURGERY
Surgery is unquestionably the most effective means of treating cancer. 
At  least  40%  of  cancer  patients  are  cured  by  surgery.  Unfortunately, 
a large fraction of patients with solid tumors have metastatic disease 
not accessible for removal. Even when cancer is not curable by surgery 
alone, the removal of tumor can afford local control of tumor, preserve 
organ function, achieve debulking that permits more effective subse-
quent therapy, and allow more detailed staging. Cancer surgery aiming 
for  cure  is  usually  planned  to  excise  the  tumor  completely  with  an 
adequate margin of normal tissue (the margin varies with the tumor 
and the anatomy), touching the tumor as little as possible to prevent 
vascular and lymphatic spread, and minimizing operative risk. Such a 
resection is defined as an R0 resection. R1 and R2 resections, in con-
trast, are imprecisely defined pathologically as having microscopic or 
macroscopic, respectively, tumor at resection margins. Such outcomes 
may be the basis for reoperation to obtain optimal margins if feasible 
and of likely clinical utility. Extending the procedure to resect draining 
lymph  nodes  obtains  prognostic  information  and  may,  in  some  ana-
tomic locations, improve survival.

Laparoscopic approaches are being used for primary abdominal and 
pelvic tumors, although with certain tumors (e.g., uterine and cervix), 
controversy exists as to the desirability of laparoscopic tissue removal. 
Lymph node spread may be assessed using the sentinel node approach, 
in which the first draining lymph node is defined by injecting a dye or 
radioisotope  into  the  tumor  site  at  operation  and  then  resecting  the 
first  node  to  turn  blue  or  collect  isotope.  The  sentinel  node  assess-
ment appears to provide information without the risks (lymphedema, 
lymphangiosarcoma)  associated  with  resection  of  all  regional  nodes. 
Advances in adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given systemically 
after removal of all local disease surgically without evidence of active 
metastatic disease) and radiation therapy following surgery have per-
mitted a substantial decrease in the extent of primary surgery necessary 
to obtain the best outcomes. Thus, “lumpectomy” with radiation ther-
apy is as effective as modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer, and 
limb-sparing surgery followed or preceded by adjuvant radiation ther-
apy  and  chemotherapy  has  replaced  amputation  for  most  childhood 
rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas. More limited surgery spares 
organ function, as in larynx and bladder cancer. In some settings (e.g., 
bulky  testicular  cancer  or  stage  III  breast  cancer),  surgery  is  not  the 
first treatment modality used. After diagnostic biopsy, chemotherapy 
and/or radiation therapy is delivered, followed by a surgical procedure 

to remove residual masses; this is called neoadjuvant therapy. Coordi-
nation among the surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and medi-
cal oncologist is crucial.

Surgery  may  be  curative  in  a  subset  of  patients  with  metastatic 
disease.  Patients  with  limited  lung  metastases  from  osteosarcoma 
may be cured by resection of the lung lesions. In patients with colon 
cancer  who  have  fewer  than  five  liver  metastases  restricted  to  one 
lobe and no extrahepatic metastases, hepatic lobectomy may produce 
long-term disease-free survival in 25% of selected patients. In the set-
ting  of  hormonally  responsive  tumors,  oophorectomy  may  eliminate 
estrogen production, and orchiectomy may reduce androgen produc-
tion,  hormones  that  drive  metastatic  breast  and  all  prostate  cancers, 
respectively. In selecting a surgeon or center for primary cancer treat-
ment, consideration must be given to the volume of cancer surgeries 
undertaken by the site. Studies in a variety of cancers have shown that 
increased annual procedure volume appears to correlate with outcome. 
Surgery is used in a number of ways for palliative or supportive care of 
the cancer patient. These include insertion and care of central venous 
catheters,  control  of  pleural  and  pericardial  effusions  and  ascites, 
caval  interruption  for  recurrent  pulmonary  emboli,  stabilization  of 
cancer-weakened  weight-bearing  bones,  and  control  of  hemorrhage, 
among  others.  Surgical  bypass  of  gastrointestinal,  urinary  tract,  or 
biliary tree obstruction can alleviate symptoms and prolong survival. 
Surgical procedures may provide relief of pain or neurologic dysfunc-
tion (spinal cord decompression). Splenectomy may relieve symptoms 
and reverse hypersplenism. Intrathecal or intrahepatic therapy relies on 
surgical  placement  of  appropriate  infusion  portals.  Surgery  may  cor-
rect other treatment-related toxicities such as adhesions or strictures. 
Plastic and reconstructive surgery can correct the effects of disfiguring 
primary treatment. Surgery is also a tool valuable in the prevention of 
cancers in high-risk populations. Prophylactic mastectomy, colectomy, 
oophorectomy,  and  thyroidectomy  are  mainstays  of  prevention  of 
genetic cancer syndromes.

 ■ RADIATION
Radiation Biology and Medicine  Therapeutic radiation is ion-
izing, causing breaks in DNA and generation of free radicals from cell 
water  that  damage  cancer  cell  membranes,  proteins,  and  organelles. 
Radiation  damage  is  augmented  by  oxygen;  hypoxic  cells  are  more 
resistant.

Ionizing radiation + H2O → H2O+ + e−
H2O+ + H2O → H3O+ + OH•
OH• → cell damage

X-ray and gamma-ray photons are the forms of ionizing radiation 
most  commonly  used  to  treat  cancer.  Particulate  ionizing  radiation 
using protons has also become available.

Radiation  dose  is  quantitated  based  on  the  amount  of  energy 
absorbed by the tumor, not on radiation generated by the machine. The 
International System (SI) unit for radiation dose is the Gray (Gy): 1 Gy 
refers to 1 J/kg of tissue; 1 Gy equals 100 centigrays (cGy) of absorbed 
dose.  A  historically  used  unit  appearing  in  the  oncology  literature, 
the  rad  (radiation  absorbed  dose),  is  defined  as  100  ergs  of  energy 
absorbed per gram of tissue and is equivalent to 1 cGy. Radiation dose 
is  measured  by  placing  detectors  at  the  body  surface  or  in  radiated 
phantoms that resemble human form and substance. The features that 
make a particular cell more or less sensitive to radiation involve DNA 
repair proteins that, in their physiologic role, protect against environ-
mentally related DNA damage.

Localized Radiation Therapy  Radiation  effect  is  influenced  by 
three determinants: total absorbed dose, number of fractions, and time 
of treatment. A typical course of radiation therapy should be described 
as  4500  cGy  delivered  to  a  particular  target  (e.g.,  mediastinum)  over 
5  weeks  in  180-cGy  fractions.  Most  curative  radiation  treatment 
programs are delivered once a day, 5 days a week, in 150- to 200-cGy 
fractions.  Nondividing  cells  are  more  resistant  than  dividing  cells; 
delivering  radiation  in  repeated  fractions  is  done  to  expose  a  larger

532 number of tumor cells that have entered the division cycle. The energy 
of the radiation determines its ability to penetrate tissue. Low-energy 
x-rays  (150–400  kV)  scatter  when  they  strike  the  body,  resulting  
in more damage to adjacent normal tissues and less radiation delivered 
to  the  tumor.  Megavoltage  radiation  (>1  MeV)  has  very  low  lateral 
scatter;  this  produces  a  skin-sparing  effect,  more  homogeneous  dis-
tribution of the radiation energy, and greater deposit of the energy in 
the  tumor,  or  target  volume.  The  transit  volume  includes  the  tissues 
through which the beam passes to the target volume. Computational 
approaches and delivery of many beams to converge on a target volume 
are the basis for “gamma knife” and related approaches to deliver high 
doses to tumor, sparing normal tissue.

Therapeutic radiation is delivered in three ways: (1) teletherapy, with 
focused  beams  of  radiation  generated  at  a  distance  and  aimed  at  the 
tumor within the patient; (2) brachytherapy, with encapsulated sources 
of radiation implanted directly into or adjacent to tumor tissues; and 
(3)  systemic  therapy,  with  radionuclides  administered,  for  example, 
intravenously  but  perhaps  targeted  by  some  means  to  a  tumor  site. 
Teletherapy with x-ray or gamma-ray photons is the most commonly 
used form of radiation therapy and also delivers particulate forms of 
radiation such as proton beams. The difference between photons and 
protons relates to volume with greatest delivery of energy: protons have 
a narrow range of energy deposition. Electron beams are a particulate 
form of radiation that, in contrast to photons and protons, have a very 
low tissue penetrance and are used to treat cutaneous tumors. Certain 
drugs  used  in  cancer  treatment  may  also  act  as  radiation  sensitizers. 
For example, compounds that incorporate into DNA (e.g., halogenated 
pyrimidines, cisplatin) augment radiation effects at local sites and are 
important adjuncts to radiation of certain tumors, e.g., squamous head 
and neck, uterine cervix, and rectal cancers.

Toxicity  of  Radiation  Therapy  Although  radiation  therapy  is 
most often administered to a local region, systemic effects, including 
fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, may develop that are related 
in part to the volume of tissue irradiated, dose fractionation, radiation 
fields,  and  individual  susceptibility.  Injured  tissues  release  cytokines 
that act systemically to produce these effects. Bone is among the most 
radio-resistant organs, with radiation effects being manifested mainly 
in children through premature fusion of the epiphyseal growth plate. 
By  contrast,  the  male  testis,  female  ovary,  and  bone  marrow  are  the 
most  sensitive  organs.  Any  bone  marrow  in  a  radiation  field  will  be 
eradicated  by  therapeutic  irradiation.  Organs  with  less  need  for  cell 
renewal, such as heart, skeletal muscle, and nerves, are more resistant 
to immediate radiation effects. In radiation-resistant organs, the vas-
cular  endothelium  is  the  most  sensitive  component.  Acute  toxicities 
include mucositis, skin erythema (ulceration in severe cases), and bone 
marrow toxicity. Often these can be alleviated by periodic interruption 
of treatment.

Chronic toxicities are more serious. Radiation of the head and neck 
region produces thyroid failure; cataracts and retinal damage can lead 
to blindness; salivary glands stop making saliva, which leads to dental 
caries and poor dentition. Mediastinal irradiation increases myocardial 
vascular disease. Other late vascular effects include chronic constric-
tive pericarditis, lung fibrosis, viscus stricture, spinal cord transection, 
and radiation cystitis or enteritis.

A  serious  late  toxicity  is  the  development  of  second  solid  tumors 
in or adjacent to the radiation fields. Such tumors can develop in any 
organ or tissue and occur at a rate of ~1% per year beginning in the 
second decade after treatment.

 ■ OTHER LOCALIZED CANCER TREATMENTS
Endoscopy allows placement of stents to unblock viscera by mechan-
ical means, palliating, for example, gastrointestinal or biliary obstruc-
tions.  Radiofrequency  ablation  (RFA)  refers  to  focused  microwave 
nonionizing radiation to induce thermal injury within a volume of tis-
sue. RFA can be useful in the control of metastatic lesions, particularly 
in liver, that may threaten biliary drainage (as one example in patients 
with  otherwise  unresectable  disease).  Cryosurgery  uses  extreme  cold 
to sterilize lesions in certain sites, such as prostate and kidney, at a very 

early stage, eliminating the need for modalities with more side effects 
such as surgery.

Some  chemicals  (porphyrins,  phthalocyanines)  are  preferentially 
taken  up  by  cancer  cells.  When  intense  light,  delivered  by  a  laser,  is 
shone  on  cells  containing  these  compounds,  free  radicals  are  gener-
ated and the cells die. Such phototherapy is used to treat skin cancer; 
ovarian cancer; and cancers of the lung, colon, rectum, and esophagus. 
Palliation of recurrent locally advanced disease can sometimes be dra-
matic and last many months.

Infusion  of  chemotherapeutic  or  biologic  agents  or  radiation- 
bearing delivery devices such as isotope-coated glass spheres into local 
sites through catheters have been used to treat disease limited to that 
site; in selected cases, prolonged control of truly localized disease has 
been possible.

SYSTEMIC CANCER TREATMENTS
The  concept  that  systemically  administered  chemicals  might  have  a 
useful  effect  on  cancers  was  historically  derived  from  three  sets  of 
observations.  Paul  Ehrlich  in  the  nineteenth  century  observed  that 
different  dyes  reacted  with  different  cell  and  tissue  components.  He 
hypothesized  the  existence  of  “magic  bullets”  that  might  bind  to 
tumors, owing to the affinity of the agent for the tumor. Observation of 
the toxic effects of certain mustard gas derivatives on the bone marrow 
during World War I suggested that smaller doses of these agents might 
be used to treat tumors of marrow-derived cells. Finally, the fact that 
tumors  from  hormone-responsive  tissues,  e.g.,  breast  tumors,  could 
shrink after oophorectomy led to the idea that endogenous or exoge-
nous  substances  might  modulate  tumor  growth  by  altering  its  regu-
latory  biology.  Chemicals  achieving  each  of  these  goals  are  currently 
used as cancer chemotherapy agents.

Anecdotal  reports  of  tumor  regression  following  intratumoral 
injection of bacterial extracts raised the possibility of immune system–
mediated  tumor  regression.  Serotherapy  of  infectious  disease  in  the 
preantibiotic era encouraged analogous efforts to develop vaccine- and 
antibody-based  treatments  for  cancer.  Administration  of  autologous 
immune cells obtained by pheresis procedures from a patient or puri-
fied  from  a  patient’s  removed  tumor,  activated  by  cytokines  ex  vivo, 
achieved durable disease control in a small fraction of patients. These 
observations provided the rationale for more modern efforts to treat 
tumors using cell-mediated immunity.

Systemic  cancer  treatments  are  of  three  broad  types.  Cytotoxic  
chemotherapy  agents  are  “small  molecules”  (generally  with  molec-
ular  mass  <1500  Da)  that  cause  major  regression  of  experimental 
tumors  growing  in  animals.  These  agents  mainly  target  DNA  struc-
ture  or  segregation  of  chromosomes  in  mitosis.  Cancer  molecular 
target  therapies  refer  to  small  molecules  designed  and  developed  to 
interact  with  a  defined  macromolecule  important  in  maintaining 
the  malignant  state.  As  described  in  Chap.  72,  successful  tumors 
have  activated  biochemical  pathways  that  lead  to  uncontrolled  pro-
liferation  through  the  action  of  hormone  receptor  proteins,  onco-
gene  products,  loss  of  cell  cycle  inhibitors,  or  loss  of  cell  death 
regulation, and have acquired the capacity to replicate chromosomes 
indefinitely,  invade,  metastasize,  and  evade  the  immune  system.  
Cancer biologic therapies are most frequently macromolecules, cells, or 
cell extracts that have a particular target (e.g., anti-growth factor recep-
tor, cytokine, or immunomodulatory antibodies) or may have the capac-
ity to induce a host immune response to kill tumor cells. Most recent 
additions to cancer biologic therapies include genetically modified cells 
that directly attack tumor cells and tumor-infecting viruses that can kill 
tumor cells but also elicit host antitumor immune responses.

 ■ SYSTEMIC CANCER THERAPY OVERVIEW
General Principles  The therapeutic index of any drug is the degree 
of separation between toxic and therapeutic doses. Really useful drugs 
have large therapeutic indices, and this usually occurs when the drug 
target is expressed in the disease-causing compartment as opposed to 
the normal compartment. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents have the 
unfortunate property that their main targets, DNA and microtubules,

are present in both normal and tumor tissues. Therefore, they have rela-
tively narrow therapeutic indices. Targeted agents can also cause effects 
on their target in normal tissues, or “off-target” effects on unrelated tar-
gets in organs experiencing damage. Biologic therapies may elicit mis-
directed immune responses on normal organ function. A key activity 
in oncology drug development is striving to administer a dose of agent 
that can convey benefit with a minimal or tolerable side effect profile.

Figure 73-2 illustrates steps in cancer drug development. Following 
demonstration of antitumor activity in animal models, potentially use-
ful anticancer agents are further evaluated to define an optimal sched-
ule of administration and suitable drug formulation. Safety testing in 
two animal species on an analogous schedule of administration defines 
the starting dose for a phase 1 trial in humans, usually but not always in 
patients with cancer who have exhausted “standard” (already approved) 
treatments.  The  initial  dose  is  usually  one-sixth  to  one-tenth  of  the 
dose just causing easily reversible toxicity in the more sensitive animal 
species. If the agent is not intrinsically toxic, doses of drug achieving 
fractions of the useful concentration from model systems are studied. 
Escalating doses of drug are then given during the human phase 1 trial 
until reversible toxicity is observed or the desired drug concentration 
is achieved. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) defines a dose that conveys 
greater toxicity than would be acceptable in routine practice, allowing 
definition of a lower maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). The occurrence 
of toxicity is, if possible, correlated with plasma drug concentrations. 
The MTD or a dose just lower than the MTD is usually the dose suit-
able for phase 2 trials, where a fixed dose is administered to a relatively 
homogeneous set of patients with a particular tumor type. If no toxicity 
has emerged in phase 1 trials, administration of the optimal biologic 
dose to achieve effective drug concentrations is undertaken. A partial 
response  (PR)  historically  was  defined  as  a  decrease  of  at  least  50% 
in  a  tumor’s  bidimensional  area  obtained  by  imaging;  more  recent 
response criteria (e.g., Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 

[RECIST])  may  use  a  30%  decrease  in  aggregate  unidimensional 
areas of target lesions. Response criteria for immunologically directed 
agents may allow a substantial transient increase in tumor volume as 
long as a patient’s clinical status is stable, as these agents may evoke 
inflammatory responses in tumors with subsequent shrinkage or sta-
bilization of lesions then occurring subsequently. A complete response 
(CR)  connotes  disappearance  of  all  tumor;  progression  of  disease 
signifies an increase in size of existing lesions by >25% from baseline 
or best response or development of new lesions; stable disease fits into 
none of the above categories.

In a phase 3 trial, evidence of improved overall survival or improve-
ment in the time to progression of disease on the part of the new drug is 
sought in comparison to an appropriate control population. Data from 
the entire process are the basis for application to a regulatory agency to 
approve the new agent for commercial marketing.

Cancer  drug  clinical  trials  conventionally  use  a  toxicity  grading 
scale where grade 1 toxicities do not require treatment, grade 2 toxic-
ities may require symptomatic treatment but are not life-threatening, 
grade 3 toxicities are potentially life-threatening if untreated, grade 4 
toxicities are actually life-threatening, and grade 5 toxicities are those 
that result in the patient’s death. Active efforts to quantitate effects of 
anticancer agents on quality of life also frequently occur in early devel-
opment of oncology drugs.

Development  of  targeted  agents  may  proceed  differently.  While 
phase 1–3 trials are still conducted, focus on a particular tumor type 
even in phase 1 may be enabled by molecular analysis to define target 
expression in a patient’s tumor necessary for or relevant to the drug’s 
action.  Ideally,  pharmacodynamic  studies  would  also  assess  whether 
the target has been hit. The failure of a targeted therapy can be either 
because  the  drug  missed  the  target  or  it  hit  the  target  but  the  target 
was  not  central  to  the  tumor’s  growth  and  survival.  Within  the  past 
decade, agents have been approved for clinical use not in relation to an

FIGURE 73-2  Steps in cancer drug discovery and development. Preclinical activity (top left) in animal models of cancers may be used as evidence to support the entry of the 
drug candidate into phase 1 trials in humans to define a correct dose and observe any clinical antitumor effect. The drug may then be advanced to phase 2 trials directed 
against specific cancer types, with rigorous quantitation of antitumor effects. Waterfall plots are a standard representation of how patients’ tumor sizes change in relation 
to treatment, with predefined cutoffs defining progression of disease (20% increase in size) or partial response (30% decrease in size) serving as benchmarks of potential 
valuable effect (top right). Swimmer plots (bottom left) allow the delineation of patients with especially long (or short) times on treatment even without response, another 
basis in the former case for potential perceived clinical benefit of the treatment. Kaplan-Meier plots (bottom right) of survival indices in phase 3 comparative trials may allow 
definition of superiority, inferiority, or no difference of treatment effect compared to standard or no treatment.

originating organ site of disease but across all organ types possessing 
certain molecular or biologic features.

Useful cancer drug treatment strategies using conventional chemo-
therapy  agents,  targeted  agents,  hormonal  treatments,  or  biologicals 
all  have  one  of  two  valuable  outcomes.  They  can  induce  cancer  cell 
death, resulting in tumor shrinkage with corresponding clinical ben-
efit evidenced by improvement in patient survival, or increase in time 
until  the  disease  progresses.  Another  potential  outcome  is  induction 

of cancer cell differentiation or dormancy with loss of tumor cell repli-
cative potential and reacquisition of phenotypic properties resembling 
normal  cells.  Interaction  of  a  chemotherapeutic  drug  with  its  target 
induces a “cascade” of further signaling steps. These signals ultimately 
lead to cell death by triggering an “execution phase,” where proteases, 
nucleases,  and  endogenous  regulators  of  the  cell  death  pathway  are 
activated (Fig. 73-3), or differentiation by alteration of cancer genome 
function.

FIGURE 73-3  Tumor growth and death pathways affected by targeted and cytotoxic agents. After a growth factor binds to its receptor (left side of figure), in the most 
commonly activated cell proliferation pathway, increased tyrosine kinase activity occurs, either by autophosphorylation of receptor-linked kinases or through recruitment 
of non-receptor-linked tyrosine kinases, which may also be active constitutively, without requiring a growth factor. This leads to docking of “adaptor” proteins to the 
phosphorylated tyrosines. One important pathway activated occurs after exchange of GDP for GTP in the RAS family of protooncogene products. GTP-RAS activates the 
RAF kinase, leading to a phosphorylation cascade of MEK and MAP kinases that ultimately alters gene function to produce transcripts that activate cell cycle progression 
through cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Another route to gene activation utilizes hormone receptors (HRs) interacting with tissue-specific growth regulators such as 
steroid hormones to alter gene function leading to cell cycle activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation can lead to activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) to produce 
the  phosphorylated  lipid  phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate,  which  activates  the  AKT  kinase  to  act  downstream  on  the  mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  kinase  (mTOR), 
directly increasing translation of key mRNAs for gene products regulating cell growth. Cytotoxic agents cause cell death (right side of figure) through apoptosis and/
or induction of autophagy. Apoptosis is also stimulated by interruption of growth factor (GF) cytokine death signals (e.g., tumor necrosis factor receptor [TNF-R]), which 
activate “upstream” cysteine aspartyl proteases (caspases) to directly digest cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, resulting in activation of “downstream” caspases; these 
activate nucleases to cause DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. Chemotherapy agents that create lesions in DNA or alter mitotic spindle function activate gene 
function to alter mitochondrial integrity. The antiapoptotic protein BCL2 attenuates mitochondrial toxicity, whereas proapoptotic gene products such as BAX, PUMA, etc., 
antagonize the action of BCL2. Damaged mitochondria release cytochrome C and apoptosis-activating factor (APAF), which activate caspase 9 to cause DNA fragmentation. 
In  addition,  membrane  damage  with  activation  of  sphingomyelinases  results  in  the  production  of  ceramides  that  can  cause  direct  damage  to  mitochondria.  Protein 
translation is followed by a folding process in the Golgi apparatus. Misfolded proteins are processed through the proteasome for protease digestion and recycling of amino 
acids. Disruption of this process can contribute to autophagy, where the cell starves for critical nutrients, or itself induce apoptosis through a distinct pathway activated 
by misfolded protein accumulation. Antiangiogenic agents and immune therapies work in the tumor stroma (lower left) on supporting elements including blood vessels and 
host inflammatory cells.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyTargeted agents differ from chemotherapy agents in that they do not 
indiscriminately cause macromolecular lesions but regulate the action 
of macromolecules to whose function tumors have been described as 
“addicted” in the sense that without the pathway’s continued action, the 
tumor cell cannot survive. In this way, targeted agents directed at such 
“oncogenic driver” molecules may alter the threshold for tumors driven 
by these molecules to undergo cell death.
Strategies in Systemic Cancer Management  The past 30 years 
have witnessed a marked evolution in the systemic treatment of cancer 
not amenable to cure by locally applied treatments. Nonspecific cyto-
toxic agents of limited efficacy for most patients but highly active and 
curative in a minority disease types have been joined by targeted and 
biologic  therapies.  Table  73-3,  A  lists  those  tumors  considered  cur-
able  by  conventionally  available  chemotherapeutic  agents  even  when 
disseminated  or  metastatic.  If  a  tumor  is  truly  localized  to  a  single 
site, consideration of surgery or primary radiation therapy should be 
given  as  well.  Chemotherapy  may  be  used  as  part  of  multimodality 
approaches to offer primary treatment to a clinically localized tumor 
(Table  73-3,  B).  Chemotherapy  can  be  administered  as  an  adjuvant, 
i.e.,  in  addition  to  surgery  or  radiation  (Table  73-3,  C),  even  after 
all clinically apparent disease has been removed. This use of chemo-
therapy  has  curative  potential  in,  e.g.,  lung,  breast,  and  colorectal

neoplasms, as it eliminates clinically unapparent tumor that may have 
already disseminated. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to administra-
tion of chemotherapy before any surgery or radiation to a local tumor 
in an effort to enhance the effect of subsequent local treatment.

Chemotherapy  is  routinely  used  in  doses  that  produce  reversible 
acute  side  effects,  primarily  consisting  of  transient  myelosuppression 
with or without gastrointestinal toxicity (usually nausea). “High-dose” 
chemotherapy regimens can produce markedly increased therapeutic 
effect, although at the cost of potentially life-threatening complications 
that  require  intensive  support,  usually  in  the  form  of  hematopoi-
etic  stem  cell  support  from  the  patient  (autologous)  or  from  donors 
matched for histocompatibility loci (allogeneic), or pharmacologic “res-
cue”  strategies  to  block  the  effect  of  the  high-dose  chemotherapy  on 
normal tissues. High-dose regimens have curative potential in defined 
clinical settings (Table 73-3, D).

If cure is not possible, chemotherapy may be undertaken with the 
goal of palliating the tumor’s effect on the host (Table 73-3, E). In this 
usage, value is perceived by the demonstration of improved symptom 
relief,  progression-free  survival,  or  overall  survival.  The  data  result 
from a clinical research protocol used as a basis for FDA approval for 
commercial  use  of  the  agent.  Patients  treated  with  palliative  intent 
should be aware of their diagnosis and the limitations of the proposed 
treatments, have access to supportive care, and have suitable “perfor-
mance  status,”  according  to  assessment  algorithms  such  as  the  one 
developed by Karnofsky (see Table 69-4) or by the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) (see Table 69-5). ECOG performance status 
(PS) 0 patients are without symptoms; PS1 patients are ambulatory but 
restricted  in  strenuous  physical  activity;  PS2  patients  are  ambulatory 
and active 50% or more of the time but unable to work; PS3 patients 
are  capable  of  limited  self-care  but  are  active  <50%  of  the  time;  and 
PS4 patients are totally confined to bed or chair and incapable of self-
care. Only PS0, PS1, and PS2 patients are generally considered suitable 
for  palliative  (noncurative)  treatment.  If  there  is  curative  potential, 
even poor-PS patients may be treated (especially if their symptoms are 
directly related to a cancer that may respond to treatment), but their 
prognosis  is  usually  inferior  to  that  of  good-PS  patients  treated  with 
similar regimens. Assessment of physiologic reserve through use of the 
geriatric assessment tool can be helpful, but no measure of comorbidi-
ties or physiologic reserve is considered standard.

The turn of the millennium marked the arrival of alternative strat-
egies for cancer treatment. Prominent among these are cancer biologic 
therapy, which harnesses the use of immune system–derived reagents 
or strategies, and cancer targeted therapies, which are directed at spe-
cific molecular targets differentially expressed in malignant as opposed 
to normal tissues.

 ■ CANCER BIOLOGIC THERAPY
Figure 73-4 presents the landscape of cancer biologic therapy agents 
and  actions.  The  goal  of  biologic  therapy  is  to  manipulate  the  host- 
tumor  interaction  in  favor  of  the  host,  potentially  at  an  optimum 
biologic  dose  that  might  be  different  than  MTD.  As  a  class,  biologic 
therapies  may  be  distinguished  from  cytotoxic  and  molecularly  tar-
geted  agents  in  that  biologic  therapies  require  activity  (e.g.,  antigen 
expression or internalization) on the part of the tumor cell or on the 
part  of  the  host  (e.g.,  T-cell  engagement  or  cytokine  elaboration)  to 
allow therapeutic effect.

Antibody-Mediated  Therapeutic  Approaches  Figure  73-4 
illustrates current antibody-based strategies in cancer treatment. The 
ability to grow very large quantities of high-affinity monoclonal anti-
bodies directed at specific tumor antigens produced by animals allows 
the  grafting  of  animal-derived  antigen-combining  sequences  into 
human  immunoglobulin  genes  (chimerized  or  humanized  products) 
or derived de novo from mice bearing human immunoglobulin gene 
loci.  Four  general  strategies  have  emerged  using  antibodies.  Anti- 
tumor cell antibodies target tumor cells directly to inhibit intracellular 
functions or attract immune or stromal cells. Bispecific tumor engaging 
(BiTe) antibodies directly bind to a tumor cell and to a host immune 
cell.  Immunoregulatory  antibodies  target  antigens  expressed  on  host

FIGURE 73-4  Immunologic treatments for cancer. Anti-tumor cell antibodies targeting antigens (T-Ag) expressed on tumor cells and indicated in parentheses for each 
antibody or antibody-derived construct (upper left) can either directly interfere with tumor cell function by, e.g., inhibiting growth-promoting pathways, or recruit host 
immune effector cells actively (especially through bispecific tumor-engaging [BiTe] strategies), Fc receptors, or cytotoxic mechanisms such as complement. Proceeding 
clockwise in the figure, antibody conjugates can also be engineered to deliver cytotoxic drugs, bacteria-derived toxins, or radioisotopes (T) to T-Ags (upper right). Relatively 
nonspecific immunomodulators include vaccines instilled directly into the tumor stroma, agents such as the “imids” that alter tumor and stromal cell cytokine production, 
and cytokines such as interferon or interleukin 2 (IL-2), which can affect tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte function or have direct antitumor effects. Vaccines targeting tumor 
cell antigens or live attenuated oncolytic viruses injected into tumors can cause tumor cell lysis with induction of a prominent host antitumor immune response to virus Ags 
and T-Ags. In the left lower portion of the figure, strategies to target stromal and immune cells include derivation of autologous T cells that are then infected with a lentivirus 
or other construct that targets antigens (T-Ags) expressed on tumor cells (chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T cells),  with the targeted antigen in parentheses. Alternatively, 
endogenous T cells can be activated by immunomodulatory cell targeting antibodies. Specifically, tumor cell–derived antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs), also in the stroma. Antigens are processed by the APCs to peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to T-cell antigen receptors (TcRs), thus 
providing a positive (+) activation signal for the cytotoxic tumor cells to kill tumor cells bearing that antigen. Negative (–) signals inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell action include the 
CTLA4 receptor (on T cells), interacting with the B7 family of negative regulatory signals from APCs, and the PD receptor (on T cells), interacting with the PD ligand-1 (PD-L1) 
(–) signal coming from tumor cells expressing the PD-L1. Strategies that inhibit CTLA4 and PD-1 function are a means of stimulating cytotoxic T-cell activity to kill tumor cells. 
Tumor stroma-directed antibodies cause anti-vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)–mediated antiangiogenic and tumor interstitial pressure-modulating strategies.

immune  cells  to  boost  the  host’s  immune  response  to  the  tumor. 
Finally, antibody conjugates link the antibody to drugs, toxins, or radio-
isotopes  to  target  these  “warheads”  for  delivery  to  the  tumor.  These 
will be considered with cytotoxic agents. Stroma-directed antibodies are 
currently available against tumor supporting vasculature.

ANTI-TUMOR  CELL  ANTIBODIES  (FIG.  73-4)  Humanized  antibodies 
against the CD20 molecule expressed on B-cell lymphomas (rituximab 
and  ofatumumab)  are  exemplary  of  antibodies  that  affect  both  sig-
naling events driving lymphomagenesis as well as activating immune 
responses  against  B-cell  neoplasms.  They  are  used  as  single  agents 
and  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  and  radiation  in  the  treat-
ment of B-cell neoplasms. Obinutuzumab is an antibody with altered 

glycosylation that enhances its ability to activate killer cells; it is also 
directed against CD20 and is of value in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Unintended  side  effects  of  any  antibody  include  infusion-related 
hypersensitivity reactions, usually limited to the first infusion, which 
can be managed with glucocorticoid and/or antihistamine prophylaxis, 
and prolonged infusion strategies.

Anti-B-cell-directed antibodies can have the unintended effect of 
exacerbating  immunosuppression  with  the  emergence  of  increased 
opportunistic  infections.  Reactivation  of  latent  infections  may  also 
occur;  an  assessment  of  a  patient’s  hepatitis  B  and  C  status  is  con-
ventionally  done  before  treatment.  Concomitant  use  of  antivirals 
directed  against  hepatitis  may  be  indicated.  Patients  with  HIV  and 
lymphoma  need  antivirals  optimized  to  minimize  interaction  with

anti-lymphoma  treatments;  consultation  with  infectious  disease 
specialists  is  warranted.  Anti-tumor  cell  antibodies  also  include 
approaches  to  activate  complement  and  are  exemplified  by  alemtu-
zumab directed against CD52; it is active in chronic lymphoid leukemia 
and T-cell malignancies. Tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis may be  
warranted.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed antibodies (e.g., 
cetuximab and panitumumab) have activity in colorectal cancer refrac-
tory to chemotherapy, particularly when used to augment the activity 
of an additional chemotherapy program, and in the primary treatment 
of head and neck cancers treated with radiation therapy. Direct effects 
on the tumor may mediate an antiproliferative effect as well as stim-
ulate the participation of host mechanisms involving immune cell or 
complement-mediated response to tumor cell–bound antibody. Anti-
EGFR antibodies can cause an acneiform rash requiring topical antibi-
otic and glucocorticoid cream treatment; photosensitivity also occurs.
The HER2/neu receptor overexpressed on epithelial cancers, espe-
cially breast and certain gastrointestinal cancers, was initially targeted 
by  trastuzumab,  with  activity  in  potentiating  the  action  of  chemo-
therapy  in  breast  cancer  as  well  as  evidence  of  single-agent  activity. 
Trastuzumab  appears  to  interrupt  intracellular  signals  derived  from 
HER2/neu and to stimulate anti-tumor cell immune mechanisms. The 
anti-HER2  antibody  pertuzumab,  specifically  targeting  the  domain 
of  HER2/neu  responsible  for  dimerization  with  other  HER2  family 
members,  is  more  specifically  directed  against  HER2  signaling  func-
tion and augments the action of trastuzumab. Both trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab can damage cardiac function, particularly in patients with 
prior exposure to anthracyclines, and left ventricular function should 
be checked pre-treatment and monitored during treatment.

The  BiTe  antibody  blinatumomab  was  constructed  to  have  an 
anti-CD19  antigen-combining  site  directed  at  a  cancer  cell  as  one 
valency with an anti-CD3 binding site as the other. This antibody can 
bring T cells (with their anti-CD3 activity) close to neoplastic B cells 
bearing the CD19 determinant. Blinatumomab is active in B-cell neo-
plasms such as acute lymphocytic leukemia. Unique toxicities include 
cytokine release syndrome (fever, hypotension, tachycardia) and neu-
rologic deterioration manifest initially by deterioration in handwriting 
accuracy, which can proceed to more florid cortical dysfunction, sug-
gesting a need for dose pausing and/or glucocorticoid use.

STROMA-DIRECTED  ANTIBODIES  (FIG.  73-4)  The  anti-vascular  endo-
thelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  antibody  bevacizumab  shows  some 
evidence  of  value  in  renal  cancers,  where  activation  of  VEGF  sig-
naling  occurs  as  part  of  disabled  hypoxia-induced  signaling  in  the 
tumor  cells.  When  combined  with  chemotherapeutic  agents,  it  may 
increase responses in colorectal and nonsquamous lung cancers. The 
mechanism for this effect may relate to improved delivery and tumor 
uptake of the active chemotherapeutic agent, owing to decreased tumor 
interstitial pressure. VEGF was originally isolated as a “tumor perme-
ability factor” causing leakiness of tumor blood vessels. When used in 
gliomas, it may, by decreasing vascular permeability, allow replacement 
of steroids to decrease intracranial pressure. Bevacizumab is directed 
against VEGF, which is normally a secreted product and not attached 
to  tumor  cells.  Bevacizumab  has  a  number  of  side  effects  including 
hypertension, thrombosis, proteinuria, hemorrhage, and gastrointesti-
nal perforations with or without prior surgeries; these adverse events 
also occur with small-molecule drugs modulating VEGFR function.
IMMUNOREGULATORY  ANTIBODIES  (FIG.  73-4)  Purely  immunoreg-
ulatory  antibodies  stimulate  immune  responses  to  mediate  tumor-
directed cytotoxicity. An understanding of the tumor-host interface has 
revealed that cytotoxic tumor-directed T cells are frequently inhibited 
by ligands upregulated in the tumor cells. The programmed death lig-
and 1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-homolog 1) was initially recognized 
as inducing T cell death through a receptor present on T cells, termed 
the programmed death (PD) receptor, which physiologically regulates 
the intensity of the immune response to any antigen. The PD family 
of  ligands  and  receptors  also  regulates  macrophage  function,  present 
in tumor stroma. These actions raised the hypothesis that antibodies 
directed against the PD signaling axis (both anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD) 

might  be  useful  in  cancer  treatment  by  allowing  reactivation  of  the 
immune response against tumors.

Ipilimumab, an antibody directed against the anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic 
T  lymphocyte  antigen  4),  which  is  expressed  on  T  cells  (not  tumor 
cells), responds to signals from antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 73-4) and 
also downregulates the intensity of the T-cell proliferative response to 
antigens derived from tumor cells. Indeed, manipulation of the CTLA4 
axis  was  the  first  demonstration  that  purely  immunoregulatory  anti-
body strategies directed at T-cell physiology could be safe and effective 
in the treatment of cancer. Ipilimumab, alone or in combination with 
PD-1-directed antibodies, is approved for treatment of metastatic mel-
anoma and lung cancers.

Nivolumab,  directed  against  the  PD-1  receptor,  or  atezolizumab 
(anti-PD-L1)  are  exemplary  of  anti-PD-1  directed  immunoregula-
tory  antibodies,  with  clinical  benefits  in  many  cancers  (Table  73-4). 
Pembrolizumab  is  approved  for  first-line  treatment  of  metastatic 
non-small-cell lung cancer tumors that express the PD-L1 ligand. This 
development was a milestone in cancer therapeutics, replacing chemo-
therapy in this patient subset.

Importantly, the clinical observation that tumors most amenable to 
treatment with immunoregulatory antibodies were in sites (lung, skin, 
genitourinary) exposed to environmental carcinogens or occurred in 
patients  with  known  mutations  in  DNA  repair  pathways  stimulated 
specific  research  as  to  whether  the  “mutational  burden”  of  tumors 
could  predict  value  from  anti-PD  strategies.  Results  to  date  confirm 
this  hypothesis  and  led  to  the  first  regulatory  approvals  for  immu-
nomodulating  antibodies  in  a  “tissue  agnostic”  fashion.  Specifically, 
detection of deficiencies in a tumor DNA mismatch repair system or 
with evidence of increased tumor mutation burden is a specific indi-
cation for use of certain immunoregulatory agents, irrespective of the 
disease  site  of  origin.  The  increased  efficacy  in  the  setting  of  higher 
tumor mutational burden is thought to be due to the presence of more 
proteins in the tumor structurally altered by mutation that can be rec-
ognized as foreign by the immune system.

Prominent autoimmune hepatic, endocrine, cutaneous, neurologic, 
and  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  can  occur  with  the  use  of  ipili-
mumab as well as the PD-1-directed antibodies. Emergency use of glu-
cocorticoids may be required to attenuate severe toxicities. Although 
theoretically  such  glucocorticoid  use  can  attenuate  the  antitumor 
effect, response rates do not appear to be compromised by their use to 
abrogate  serious  organ  toxicity  attributable  to  use  of  immunomodu-
latory antibodies. Importantly for the general internist, immunologic 
toxicities  can  occur  late  after  exposure  to  the  modulators  of  PD  and 
CTLA4  action,  even  while  the  patient  may  have  sustained  control  of 
tumor growth.
Nontargeted 
Immunomodulators  (Fig.  73-4)  Bacille 
Calmette-Guérin,  a  killed  mycobacterial  product,  invokes  a  useful 
immune response when instilled locally into the bladder in the setting 
of preinvasive bladder cancers. The “imids” thalidomide, lenalidomide, 
and  pomalidomide  alter  cytokine  elaboration  in  the  tumor  microen-
vironment  and  have  antiangiogenic  actions.  They  are  a  cornerstone 
in  the  management  of  multiple  myeloma.  Thromboses  (warranting 
consideration  of  prophylactic  anticoagulation),  gastrointestinal  and 
neuropathic adverse events, and prominent teratogenicity can occur as 
a consequence of their use.
Cytokines  Only interferon α (IFN-α) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) are 
in routine clinical use. IFN is not curative for any tumor but can induce 
partial responses in follicular lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, chronic 
myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. It produces fever, 
fatigue, a flulike syndrome, malaise, myelosuppression, and depression 
and can induce clinically significant autoimmune disease.

IL-2 exerts its antitumor effects indirectly through augmentation of 
immune  function.  Its  biologic  activity  is  to  promote  the  growth  and 
activity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. High doses of IL-2 can 
produce  tumor  regression  in  certain  patients  with  metastatic  mela-
noma  and  renal  cell  cancer.  About  2–5%  of  patients  may  experience 
complete remissions that are durable. Patients may require blood pres-
sure support and intensive care to manage the toxicity. However, once

T  Cell–Mediated  Therapies  The  strongest  evidence  that  the 
immune  system  can  exert  clinically  meaningful  antitumor  effects 
comes from allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Adoptively trans-
ferred T cells from the donor expand in the tumor-bearing host, recog-
nize the tumor as being foreign, and can mediate impressive antitumor 
effects (graft-versus-tumor effects). Three types of currently used can-
cer treatments take advantage of the ability of T cells to kill tumor cells.

1.  Transfer of allogeneic T cells. This occurs in three major settings: in 
allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation;  as  purified  lymphocyte 
transfusions following bone marrow recovery after allogeneic bone 
marrow  transplantation;  and  as  pure  lymphocyte  transfusions  fol-
lowing immunosuppressive (nonmyeloablative) therapy (also called 
reduced-intensity or minitransplants). In each of these settings, the 
effector  cells  are  donor  T  cells  that  recognize  the  tumor  as  being 
foreign, probably through minor histocompatibility differences. The 
main  risk  of  such  therapy  is  the  development  of  graft-versus-host 
disease because of the minimal difference between the cancer and 
the normal host cells. This approach has been highly effective in cer-
tain hematologic cancers refractory to chemotherapeutic strategies.
2.  Transfer  of  autologous  T  cells.  In  this  approach,  the  patient’s  own  T 
cells are removed from the tumor-bearing host, manipulated in several 
ways in vitro, and given back to the patient. Tumor antigen–specific 
T cells can be developed after retroviral transduction of the desired 
T-cell  antigen  receptor  and  expanded  to  large  numbers  over  many 
weeks ex vivo before administration. These chimeric antigen receptor 
(CAR) T cells (Fig. 73-4) have evidence of sustained value in patients 
with refractory hematopoietic neoplasms such as diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma  and  mantle  cell  lymphoma.  Prominent  adverse  effects 
include  cytokine  release  (fever,  tachycardia,  hypotension)  and  neu-
rologic manifestations. Clinical investigations are seeking to develop 
solid-tumor antigen-directed CAR strategies, as well as to utilize dif-
ferent immune cell populations such as NK cells to deliver the antigen 
receptor construct in ways that may allow “off-the-shelf” products not 
requiring manipulation and purification of patients’ autologous cells.
  A second autologous T-cell strategy uses activation of the patient’s 
T  cells  to  polyclonal  stimulators  such  as  anti-CD3  and  anti-CD28 
after a short period ex vivo and then amplification in the host after 
transfer  by  stimulation  with  IL-2.  Short  periods  removed  from 
the patient permit the cells to overcome the tumor-induced T-cell 
defects, and such cells traffic and home to sites of disease better than 
cells that have been in culture for many weeks.

3.  Tumor  vaccines  aimed  at  boosting  T-cell  immunity.  Two  types  of 
vaccine  approaches  are  currently  approved.  Purified  autologous 
antigen-presenting cells can be pulsed with tumor, its membranes, or 
particular tumor antigens and delivered as a vaccine. Vaccine adju-
vants  such  as  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor 
(GM-CSF) may be co-administered. One such vaccine, sipuleucel-T 
(Fig.  73-4),  is  approved  for  use  in  patients  with  hormone- 
independent  prostate  cancer.  In  this  approach,  the  patient  under-
goes  leukapheresis,  wherein  mononuclear  cells  (that  include  
antigen-presenting cells) are removed from the patient’s blood. The 
cells are pulsed in a laboratory with an antigenic fusion protein com-
prising a protein frequently expressed by prostate cancer cells, pros-
tate  acid  phosphatase,  fused  to  GM-CSF,  and  matured  to  increase 
their capacity to present the antigen to immune effector cells. The 
cells are then returned to the patient in a well-tolerated treatment. 
Although no objective tumor response was documented in clinical 
trials, median survival was increased by about 4 months.
  Another  important  vaccine  strategy  is  directed  at  infectious 
agents whose action ultimately is tied to the development of human 
cancer.  Hepatitis  B  vaccine  in  an  epidemiologic  sense  prevents 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and a tetravalent human papillomavirus 
vaccine  prevents  infection  by  virus  types  currently  accounting  for 
70% of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, these vaccines are ineffective 
at treating patients who have developed a virus-induced cancer.

Oncolytic  Viruses  (Fig.  73-4)  Laboratory  studies  in  animals 
have  utilized  viruses  to  destroy  tumors  because  tumor  cells  lack 
endogenous  host  mechanisms,  e.g.,  IFN  elaboration  or  recognition 
strategies of viral nucleic acids, that limit virus spread. Viral infection 
of  tumors  also  can  stimulate  a  prominent  host  response  to  viral  and 
tumor  cell  antigens,  leading  to  immune  effects  against  local  tumor 
cells. Talimogene laherparepvec is a clinically approved attenuated her-
pes virus that acts to stimulate immune responses when instilled locally 
into melanoma deposits. Systemic effects are minimal in this applica-
tion. This general strategy is being considered particularly in tumors 
not  amenable  to  useful  effects  of  currently  approved  immunoregula-
tory antibodies or in conjunction with immunoregulatory antibodies.
 ■ CANCER CYTOTOXIC THERAPY
Table 73-5 lists commonly used cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy agents 
and pertinent clinical aspects of their use, with particular reference to 
adverse effects that might be encountered by the generalist in the care 
of  patients.  The  drugs  were  initially  discovered  through  screening  of 
chemicals and natural product extracts to define evidence of antitumor 
activity  in  animals  or  were  designed  with  knowledge  of  biochemi-
cal  pathways  affecting  nucleic  acid  synthesis.  They  may  be  usefully 
grouped  into  two  general  categories:  those  affecting  DNA  and  those 
affecting microtubules.

As illustrated in Fig. 73-3, disruption of DNA or microtubule integ-
rity is a major trigger of cellular apoptosis pathways. An additional fac-
tor in drug effect stems from recent observations that tumor cells have 
increased tolerance of specific types of DNA damage owing to defects 
in DNA repair pathways. This state is thought to facilitate the survival 
of  the  neoplastic  clone  as  it  experiences  DNA  mutations  during  the 
course  of  carcinogenesis.  DNA-directed  cytotoxic  agents  can  interact 
with certain DNA repair mutations in a “synthetic lethal” fashion: the 
DNA  repair  mutation  enhances  lethality  of  the  chemotherapy  agent. 
Examples of a potential “synthetic lethal effect” will be pointed out in 
relation to clinical applications below.

DNA-Interactive Agents  DNA replication occurs during the syn-
thesis or S-phase of the cell cycle, with chromosome segregation of the 
replicated DNA in the M, or mitosis, phase. The G1 and G2 “gap phases” 
precede  S  and  M,  respectively.  Chemotherapeutic  agents  have  been 
divided into “phase-nonspecific” agents, which can act in any phase of 
the cell cycle, and “phase-specific” agents, which require the cell to be 
at a particular cell cycle phase to cause greatest effect.

Alkylating  agents  (Table  73-5)  as  a  class  are  cell  cycle  phase– 
nonspecific  agents.  They  break  down,  either  spontaneously  or  after 
normal organ or tumor cell metabolism, to reactive intermediates that 
covalently modify bases in DNA. This leads to cross-linkage of DNA 
strands or the appearance of breaks in DNA as a result of repair efforts. 
Damaged  DNA  cannot  complete  normal  cell  division;  in  addition,  it 
activates  apoptosis.  Alkylating  agents  share  similar  toxicities:  myelo-
suppression, alopecia, gonadal dysfunction, mucositis, and pulmonary 
fibrosis.  They  also  share  the  capacity  to  cause  “second”  neoplasms, 
particularly  leukemia,  years  after  use,  particularly  when  used  in  low 
doses for protracted periods.

Cyclophosphamide  is  inactive  unless  metabolized  by  the  liver  to 
4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide,  which  decomposes  into  an  alkylating 
species, as well as to chloroacetaldehyde and acrolein. The latter causes 
chemical  cystitis;  therefore,  excellent  hydration  must  be  maintained 
while  using  cyclophosphamide.  If  severe,  the  cystitis  may  be  attenu-
ated or prevented altogether (if expected from the dose of cyclophos-
phamide  to  be  used)  by  mesna  (2-mercaptoethanesulfonate).  Liver 
disease  impairs  cyclophosphamide  activation.  Sporadic  interstitial 
pneumonitis leading to pulmonary fibrosis can accompany the use of 
cyclophosphamide, and high doses used in conditioning regimens for 
bone marrow transplant can cause cardiac dysfunction. Ifosfamide is a 
cyclophosphamide analogue also activated in the liver, but more slowly, 
and it requires co-administration of mesna to prevent bladder injury. 
CNS effects, including somnolence, confusion, and psychosis, can fol-
low ifosfamide use; the incidence appears related to low body surface 
area or decreased creatinine clearance.

Several  alkylating  agents  are  less  commonly  used.  Bendamustine 
has  activity  in  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  and  certain  lympho-
mas.  Busulfan  can  cause  profound  myelosuppression,  alopecia,  and 
pulmonary  toxicity  but  is  relatively  “lymphocyte  sparing.”  It  is  used 
in  transplant  preparation  regimens.  Melphalan  shows  variable  oral 
bioavailability  and  undergoes  extensive  binding  to  albumin  and  α1-
acidic glycoprotein. Mucositis appears more prominently; however, it 
has prominent activity in multiple myeloma.

Nitrosoureas  break  down  to  carbamylating  species  that  not  only 
cause a distinct pattern of DNA base pair–directed reactivity but also 
can  covalently  modify  proteins.  They  share  the  feature  of  causing 
relatively delayed bone marrow toxicity, which can be cumulative and 
long-lasting. Procarbazine is metabolized in the liver and possibly in 
tumor  cells  to  yield  a  variety  of  free  radical  and  alkylating  species. 
In  addition  to  myelosuppression,  it  causes  hypnotic  and  other  CNS 
effects, including vivid nightmares. It can cause a disulfiram-like syn-
drome on ingestion of ethanol. Dacarbazine (DTIC) is activated in the 
liver  to  yield  the  highly  reactive  methyl  diazonium  cation.  It  causes 
only  modest  myelosuppression  21–25  days  after  a  dose  but  causes 
prominent  nausea  on  day  1.  Temozolomide  is  structurally  related  to 
dacarbazine but is activated by nonenzymatic hydrolysis in tumors and 
is bioavailable orally. Brain tumors with alkylguanine alkyl transferase 
deficiency are selectively susceptible to temozolomide, which alkylates 
the O6 position of guanine.

Cisplatin was discovered fortuitously by observing that bacteria pres-
ent in electrolysis solutions with platinum electrodes could not divide. 
Only the cis diamine configuration is active as an antitumor agent. In 
tumor cells, a chloride is lost from each position. The resulting posi-
tively charged species is an efficient DNA interactor, forming Pt-based 
cross-links. Cisplatin is administered with abundant hydration, includ-
ing forced diuresis with mannitol to prevent kidney damage; even with 
the use of hydration, gradual decrease in kidney function is common, 
along  with  noteworthy  anemia.  Hypomagnesemia  frequently  attends 
cisplatin use and can lead to hypocalcemia and tetany. Other common 
toxicities include neurotoxocity with stocking-and-glove sensorimotor 
neuropathy. Hearing loss occurs in 50% of patients treated with con-
ventional  doses.  Cisplatin  is  intensely  emetogenic,  requiring  prophy-
lactic  antiemetics.  Myelosuppression  is  less  evident  than  with  other 
alkylating agents. Chronic vascular toxicity (Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
coronary  artery  disease)  is  a  more  unusual  toxicity.  Carboplatin  dis-
plays less nephro-, oto-, and neurotoxicity. However, myelosuppression 
is more frequent, and because the drug is exclusively cleared through 
the kidney, adjustment of dose for creatinine clearance must be accom-
plished  through  use  of  various  dosing  nomograms.  Oxaliplatin  is  a 
platinum analogue with noteworthy activity in colon cancers refractory 
to other treatments. It is prominently neurotoxic.

Trabectedin binds to DNA through the “DNA minor groove” with 
covalent interaction with the N2 position of certain guanines. Uniquely 
among  the  DNA  interactors,  this  can  lead  to  the  disruption  of  the 
selective  FUS-CHOP  transcription  factor  action,  important  in  the 
pathogenesis of certain liposarcomas. Transient altered liver function 
can occur, as well as cytopenias. Lurbinectedin is an analogue of tra-
bectedin and also alters RNA polymerase function after binding to the 
minor groove of DNA, but has a distinct pharmacologic profile.
Antitumor  Antibiotics  and  Topoisomerase  Poisons  Anti-
tumor antibiotics are substances produced by bacteria that provide a 
chemical defense against hostile microorganisms. They bind to DNA 
directly and can frequently undergo electron transfer reactions to gen-
erate free radicals in close proximity to DNA, leading to DNA damage 
in the form of single-strand breaks or cross-links. Topoisomerase poi-
sons include natural products or semisynthetic derivatives that modify 
enzymes that allow DNA to unwind during replication or transcription. 
These include topoisomerase I, which creates single-strand breaks that 
then rejoin following the passage of the other DNA strand through the 
break. Topoisomerase II creates double-strand breaks through which 
another segment of DNA duplex passes before rejoining. Owing to the 
role of topoisomerase I in the replication fork, topoisomerase I poisons 
cause lethality if the topoisomerase I–induced lesions occur in S-phase.

Doxorubicin intercalates into DNA, thereby altering DNA structure, 
replication, and topoisomerase II function. It can also undergo reduc-
tion of its quinone ring system, with reoxidation to form reactive oxy-
gen radicals. It causes predictable myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea, 
and mucositis. In addition, it causes acute cardiotoxicity in the form 
of atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias, but these are rarely of clinical 
significance. In contrast, cumulative doses >550 mg/m2 are associated 
with  a  10%  incidence  of  chronic  cardiomyopathy.  The  incidence  of 
cardiomyopathy  appears  to  be  related  to  peak  serum  concentration, 
with  low-dose,  frequent  treatment  or  continuous  infusions  better 
tolerated than intermittent higher-dose exposures. Cardiotoxicity has 
been related to iron-catalyzed oxidation and reduction of doxorubicin 
in the heart. Dexrazoxane is an intracellular chelating agent that can act 
as a cardio-protectant. Doxorubicin’s cardiotoxicity is increased when 
given together with trastuzumab, the anti-HER2/neu antibody. Radi-
ation recall or interaction with concomitantly administered radiation 
to  cause  local  site  complications  is  frequent.  The  drug  is  a  powerful 
vesicant, with necrosis of tissue apparent 4–7 days after an extravasa-
tion; therefore, it should be administered into a rapidly flowing intra-
venous line. Dexrazoxane also can mitigate doxorubicin extravasation. 
Doxorubicin is metabolized by the liver, so doses must be reduced by 
50–75% in the presence of liver dysfunction. Daunorubicin is closely 
related to doxorubicin and is preferable to doxorubicin owing to less 
mucositis  and  colonic  damage  with  frequent  high  doses  used  in  the 

curative  treatment  of  leukemia.  Idarubicin  is  also  used  in  leukemia 
treatment  and  may  have  somewhat  less  cardiotoxicity.  Encapsulation 
of  daunorubicin  into  a  liposomal  formulation  has  attenuated  cardiac 
toxicity  with  antitumor  activity  in  Kaposi’s  sarcoma,  other  sarcomas, 
multiple myeloma, and ovarian cancer.

Mitoxantrone  is  a  synthetic  topoisomerase  II–directed  agent  with 
a  mechanism  similar  to  the  anthracyclines,  with  less  but  not  absent 
cardiotoxicity, comparing the ratio of cardiotoxic to effective doses; it 
is still associated with a 10% incidence of cardiotoxicity at cumulative 
doses of >150 mg/m2. Etoposide binds directly to topoisomerase II and 
DNA in a reversible ternary complex. It stabilizes the covalent inter-
mediate in the enzyme’s action where the enzyme is covalently linked 
to DNA. Prominent clinical effects include myelosuppression, nausea, 
and  transient  hypotension  related  to  the  speed  of  administration  of 
the agent. Etoposide is a mild vesicant but is relatively free from other 
large-organ toxicities.

Camptothecins target topoisomerase I. Topotecan is a camptothecin 
derivative approved for use in gynecologic tumors and small-cell lung 
cancer.  Toxicity  is  limited  to  myelosuppression  and  mucositis.  Irino-
tecan is a camptothecin with evidence of activity in colon carcinoma. 
Irinotecan  is  a  prodrug,  metabolized  in  the  liver  to  SN-38,  its  active 
metabolite.  Levels  of  SN-38  are  particularly  high  in  the  setting  of 
Gilbert’s  disease,  characterized  by  defective  uridine  diphosphate  glu-
curonosyl  transferase  (UGT)  1A1  and  indirect  hyperbilirubinemia,  a

condition that affects about 10% of the white population in the United 
States. In addition, irinotecan’s myelosuppression is clearly influenced 
by  the  patient’s  genotype  for  UGT1As.  Irinotecan  causes  a  delayed  
(48–72 h) secretory diarrhea related to the toxicity of SN-38. The diar-
rhea can be treated effectively with loperamide or octreotide; immedi-
ate diarrhea when it occurs is responsive to atropine.

Fam-trastuzumab  deruxtecan  and  sacituzumab  govitecan  are  
antibody-drug  conjugates  (Fig.  73-4)  that  allow  specific  targeting 
of  camptothecin  and  SN-38,  respectively,  to  HER2-positive  and 
triple-negative  breast  cancers,  respectively.  Adverse  events  are  driven 
by off-target effects of the chemotherapy agent and include cytopenia, 
nausea,  vomiting,  and,  in  the  case  of  fam-trastuzumab  deruxtecan, 
severe interstitial pneumonitis.

Bleomycin  forms  complexes  with  Fe2+  while  also  bound  to 
DNA.  It  remains  an  important  component  of  curative  regimens  for  
Hodgkin’s disease and germ cell neoplasms. Oxidation of Fe2+ gives rise 
to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, causing DNA damage. The drug 
causes  little,  if  any,  myelosuppression.  Bleomycin  is  cleared  rapidly, 
but  augmented  skin  and  pulmonary  toxicity  in  the  presence  of  renal 
failure  necessitates  dose  reduction  in  renal  failure.  Bleomycin  is  not 
a vesicant and can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or 
subcutaneously.  Common  side  effects  include  fever  and  chills,  facial 
flush,  and  Raynaud’s  phenomenon.  The  most  feared  complication 
of  bleomycin  treatment  is  pulmonary  fibrosis,  which  increases  in 
incidence  at  >300  cumulative  units  administered  and  is  minimally 
responsive to treatment (e.g., glucocorticoids). The earliest indicator of 
an adverse effect is usually a decline in the carbon monoxide diffusing 
capacity (DLCO) or coughing, although cessation of drug immediately 
upon documentation of a decrease in DLCO may not prevent further 
decline in pulmonary function. Bleomycin is inactivated by a bleomy-
cin  hydrolase,  whose  concentration  is  diminished  in  skin  and  lung. 
Because bleomycin-dependent electron transport is dependent on O2, 
bleomycin  toxicity  may  become  apparent  after  exposure  to  transient 
very high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) even late after treatment. 
Thus,  during  surgical  procedures,  patients  with  prior  exposure  to 
bleomycin  should  be  maintained  on  the  lowest  FIO2  consistent  with 
maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation.

Dactinomycin  interacts  directly  with  DNA  to  inhibit  RNA  tran-
scription.  It  is  important  in  the  curative  treatment  of  pediatric 
neoplasms, some of which also occur in young adults. Prominent mye-
losuppression, mucositis, alopecia, radiation recall, and nausea require 
management.

Calicheamicins are DNA-interacting antitumor antibiotics too toxic 
for clinical use but, when used as antibody-drug conjugates, can be use-
ful in the treatment of CD33+ acute myeloid leukemia (gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin)  and  CD22+  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (inotuzumab 
ozogamicin). Patients must be monitored for hypersensitivity reactions 
and for hepatotoxicity due to veno-occlusive disease of hepatic veins, 
resulting from release of the calicheamicin or metabolites in the liver.

Antimetabolites  A  broad  definition  of  antimetabolites  would 
include compounds that interfere with purine or pyrimidine synthesis. 
Some  antimetabolites  also  cause  DNA  damage  indirectly,  through 
misincorporation into DNA. They tend to convey greatest toxicity to 
cells in S-phase, and the degree of toxicity increases with duration of 
exposure. Common toxic manifestations include stomatitis, diarrhea, 
and myelosuppression.

Methotrexate  inhibits  dihydrofolate  reductase,  which  regen-
erates  reduced  folates  from  the  oxidized  folates  produced  when 
thymidine  monophosphate  is  formed  from  deoxyuridine  monophos-
phate.  Without  reduced  folates,  cells  die  a  “thymine-less”  death.  N5- 
Tetrahydrofolate or N5-formyltetrahydrofolate (leucovorin) can bypass 
this  block  and  rescue  cells  from  methotrexate,  which  is  retained  in 
cells  by  polyglutamylation.  Methotrexate  is  transported  into  cells  by 
a membrane carrier, and high concentrations of drug can bypass this 
carrier and allow diffusion of drug directly into cells. These properties 
have suggested the design of “high-dose” methotrexate regimens with 
leucovorin  rescue  of  normal  marrow  and  mucosa  as  part  of  curative 
approaches to osteosarcoma in the adjuvant setting and hematopoietic 

neoplasms  of  children  and  adults.  Methotrexate  is  cleared  by  the 
kidney via both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, and tox-
icity is augmented by renal dysfunction and drugs such as salicylates, 
probenecid,  and  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  that  undergo 
tubular  secretion.  With  normal  renal  function,  15  mg/m2  leucovorin 
will  rescue  10−8–10−6  M  methotrexate  in  3–4  doses.  However,  with 
decreased creatinine clearance, doses of 50–100 mg/m2 are continued 
until methotrexate levels are <5 × 10−8 M. In addition to bone marrow 
suppression and mucosal irritation, methotrexate can cause renal fail-
ure itself at high doses owing to crystallization in renal tubules; there-
fore, high-dose regimens require alkalinization of urine with increased 
flow  by  hydration.  Methotrexate  can  be  sequestered  in  third-space 
collections and diffuse back into the general circulation, causing pro-
longed myelosuppression. Less frequent adverse effects include revers-
ible  increases  in  transaminases  and  hypersensitivity-like  pulmonary 
syndrome. Chronic low-dose methotrexate can cause hepatic fibrosis. 
When  administered  to  the  intrathecal  space,  methotrexate  can  cause 
chemical arachnoiditis and CNS dysfunction.

Pemetrexed is a folate-directed antimetabolite that inhibits the activ-
ity  of  several  enzymes,  including  thymidylate  synthetase  (TS),  dihy-
drofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. 
To avoid toxicity to normal tissues, pemetrexed is given with low-dose 
folate and vitamin B12 supplementation. Pemetrexed has notable activ-
ity against certain lung cancers and, in combination with cisplatin, also 
against mesotheliomas.

5-Fluorouracil  (5-FU)  represents  an  early  example  of  “rational” 
drug  design  in  that  tumor  cells  incorporate  radiolabeled  uracil  more 
efficiently into DNA than normal cells. 5-FU is metabolized in cells to 
5′FdUMP,  which  inhibits  TS.  In  addition,  misincorporation  can  lead 
to  single-strand  breaks,  and  RNA  can  aberrantly  incorporate  FUMP. 
5-FU  is  metabolized  by  dihydropyrimidine  dehydrogenase,  and  defi-
ciency  of  this  enzyme  can  lead  to  excessive  toxicity  from  5-FU.  Oral 
bioavailability  varies  unreliably,  but  prodrugs  such  as  capecitabine 
have been developed that allow at least equivalent activity to parenteral 
5-FU-based approaches. Intravenous administration of 5-FU leads to 
bone marrow suppression after short infusions but to stomatitis after 
prolonged infusions. Leucovorin augments the activity of 5-FU by pro-
moting formation of the ternary covalent complex of 5-FU, the reduced 
folate, and TS. Less frequent toxicities include CNS dysfunction, with 
prominent  cerebellar  signs,  and  endothelial  toxicity  manifested  by 
thrombosis, including pulmonary embolus and myocardial infarction. 
Trifluridine  is  a  fluorinated  pyrimidine  that  as  the  triphosphate  is 
directly  incorporated  into  DNA,  evoking  DNA  damage,  and  as  the 
monophosphate  can  inhibit  TS.  It  is  administered  as  a  fixed-dose 
combination with tipiracil, an inhibitor of trifluridine degradation by 
thymidine phosphorylase.

Cytosine  arabinoside  (ara-C)  is  incorporated  into  DNA  after  for-
mation  of  ara-CTP,  resulting  in  S-phase–related  toxicity.  Continuous 
infusion schedules allow maximal efficiency, with uptake maximal at  
5–7  μM.  Ara-C  can  be  administered  intrathecally.  Adverse  effects 
include  nausea,  diarrhea,  stomatitis,  chemical  conjunctivitis,  and 
cerebellar  ataxia.  Gemcitabine  is  a  cytosine  derivative  that  is  similar 
to  ara-C  in  that  it  is  incorporated  into  DNA  after  anabolism  to  the 
triphosphate, rendering DNA susceptible to breakage and repair syn-
thesis,  which  differs  from  that  in  ara-C  in  that  gemcitabine-induced 
lesions are very inefficiently removed. In contrast to ara-C, gemcitabine 
appears to have useful activity in a variety of solid tumors, with limited 
nonmyelosuppressive toxicities.

6-Thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) are used in the treat-
ment  of  acute  lymphoid  leukemia.  Although  administered  orally, 
they  display  variable  bioavailability.  6MP  is  metabolized  by  xanthine 
oxidase and therefore requires dose reduction when used with allopu-
rinol. 6MP is also metabolized by thiopurine methyltransferase; genetic 
deficiency of thiopurine methyltransferase results in excessive toxicity.
Fludarabine  phosphate  is  a  prodrug  of  F-adenine  arabinoside 
(F-ara-A),  which  in  turn  was  designed  to  diminish  the  susceptibility 
of  ara-A  to  adenosine  deaminase.  F-ara-A  is  incorporated  into  DNA 
and  can  cause  delayed  cytotoxicity  even  in  cells  with  low  growth 
fraction, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular B-cell

lymphoma. CNS and peripheral nerve dysfunction and T-cell depletion 
leading to opportunistic infections can occur in addition to myelosup-
pression. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine is a similar compound with activity 
in hairy cell leukemia. Hydroxyurea inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, 
resulting  in  S-phase  block.  It  is  orally  bioavailable  and  useful  for  the 
acute management of myeloproliferative states.

Asparaginase is a bacterial enzyme that causes breakdown of extra-
cellular asparagine required for protein synthesis in certain leukemic 
cells. This effectively stops tumor cell DNA synthesis, as DNA synthesis 
requires  concurrent  protein  synthesis.  The  outcome  of  asparaginase 
action  is  therefore  very  similar  to  the  result  of  the  small-molecule 
antimetabolites. Because asparaginase is a foreign protein, hypersensi-
tivity reactions are common, as are effects on organs such as pancreas 
and liver that normally require continuing protein synthesis. This may 
result in decreased insulin secretion with hyperglycemia, with or with-
out hyperamylasemia and clotting function abnormalities. Close mon-
itoring  of  clotting  functions  should  accompany  use  of  asparaginase. 
Paradoxically, owing to depletion of rapidly turning over anticoagulant 
factors,  thromboses  particularly  affecting  the  CNS  may  also  be  seen 
with asparaginase.

Mitotic Spindle Inhibitors  Microtubules form the mitotic spin-
dle, and in interphase cells, they are responsible for the cellular “scaf-
folding”  along  which  various  motile  and  secretory  processes  occur. 
Microtubules  are  composed  of  repeating  heterodimers  of  α  and  β 
isoforms of the protein tubulin. Vincristine binds to the tubulin het-
erodimer  with  the  result  that  microtubules  are  disaggregated.  This 
results in the block of growing cells in M-phase, where a structurally 
disordered mitotic spindle apparatus is a powerful proapoptotic signal 
(Fig. 73-3). Vincristine is metabolized by the liver, and dose adjustment 
in  the  presence  of  hepatic  dysfunction  is  required.  It  is  a  powerful 
vesicant, and infiltration can be treated by local heat and infiltration 
of  hyaluronidase.  At  clinically  used  intravenous  doses,  neurotoxicity 
in the form of glove-and-stocking neuropathy is frequent. Acute neu-
ropathic  effects  include  jaw  pain,  paralytic  ileus,  urinary  retention, 
and  the  syndrome  of  inappropriate  antidiuretic  hormone  secretion. 
Myelosuppression  is  not  seen  at  conventional  doses.  Vinblastine  is 
similar to vincristine, except that it tends to be more myelotoxic, with 
more  frequent  thrombocytopenia  and  also  mucositis  and  stomatitis. 
Vinorelbine is a vinca alkaloid that appears to have differences in resis-
tance patterns in comparison to vincristine and vinblastine; it may be 
administered orally.

The  taxanes  include  paclitaxel  and  docetaxel.  These  agents  differ 
from  the  vinca  alkaloids  in  that  the  taxanes  stabilize  microtubules 
against  depolymerization.  The  “stabilized”  microtubules  function 
abnormally and are not able to undergo the normal dynamic changes 
of  microtubule  structure  and  function  necessary  for  cell  cycle  com-
pletion.  Taxanes  are  among  the  most  broadly  active  antineoplastic 
agents  for  use  in  solid  tumors,  with  evidence  of  activity  in  ovarian 
cancer,  breast  cancer,  Kaposi’s  sarcoma,  and  lung  tumors.  They  are 
administered  intravenously,  and  their  vehicles  cause  hypersensitivity 
reactions.  Premedication  with  dexamethasone  (8–16  mg  orally  or 
intravenously  12  and  6  h  before  treatment)  and  diphenhydramine  
(50  mg)  and  cimetidine  (300  mg),  both  30  min  before  treatment, 
decreases but does not eliminate the risk of hypersensitivity reactions 
to  the  paclitaxel  vehicle.  A  protein-bound  formulation  of  paclitaxel 
(called nab-paclitaxel) has at least equivalent antineoplastic activity and 
decreased risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Paclitaxel may also cause 
myelosuppression,  neurotoxicity  in  the  form  of  glove-and-stocking 
numbness,  and  paresthesia.  Docetaxel  causes  comparable  degrees  of 
myelosuppression  and  neuropathy.  Docetaxel  uses  a  different  vehicle 
that can cause fluid retention in addition to hypersensitivity reactions; 
dexamethasone premedication with or without antihistamines is also 
frequently used. Cabazitaxel is a taxane with somewhat better activity 
in prostate cancers than earlier generations of taxanes, perhaps due to 
superior delivery to sites of disease.

Epothilones  represent  a  class  of  microtubule-stabilizing  agents 
optimized  for  activity  in  taxane-resistant  tumors.  Ixabepilone  has 
clear  evidence  of  activity  in  breast  cancers  resistant  to  taxanes  and 

anthracyclines such as doxorubicin. Side effects include myelosuppres-
sion  and  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy.  Eribulin  is  a  microtubule-
directed  agent  with  activity  in  patients  who  have  had  progression  of 
disease  on  taxanes.  It  alters  dynamics  of  microtubule  remodeling  in 
cells.

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody conjugate of the HER2/
neu-directed  trastuzumab  and  a  highly  toxic  microtubule  targeted 
drug  (emtansine),  which  by  itself  is  too  toxic  for  human  use;  the 
antibody-drug  conjugate  shows  valuable  activity  in  patients  with 
breast cancer who have developed resistance to the “naked” antibody. 
Brentuximab  vedotin  is  an  anti-CD30  antibody  drug  conjugate  with 
the distinct microtubule poison dolastatin with activity in neoplasms 
such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma where the tumor cells frequently express 
CD30. Polatuzumab vedotin analogously targets CD79a in B-cell lym-
phomas. Enfortumab vedotin uses an antibody to NECTIN4 to target 
the vedotin “warhead” to urothelial neoplasms expressing that target. 
Belantamab  mafodotin  targets  BCMA  (B-cell  maturation)  expressed 
myeloma  but  using  a  distinct  microtubule  toxin,  auristatin.  Toxicity 
from  these  agents  is  driven  by  off-target  effects  of  the  microtubule 
agent and include myelosuppression and neuropathy, but belantamab 
mafodotin can cause ocular keratopathy, which requires monitoring.

 ■ CANCER MOLECULAR TARGETED THERAPY
Agents  in  this  class  share  the  characteristic  that  they  are  directed  at 
specific cancer cell molecular targets important in the proliferation of 
tumors. While these agents can ultimately lead to tumor cell death, this 
occurs by altered regulation of a specific biochemical pathway affecting 
tumor cell susceptibility to apoptosis or growth arrest (Fig. 73-3).

Hormone  Receptor–Directed  Therapy  Steroid  hormone 
receptor–related  molecules  were  arguably  the  first  “molecular  target” 
classes of anticancer drugs. When bound to their ligands, these recep-
tors can alter gene transcription in hormone-responsive tissues. While 
in some cases, such as breast cancer, demonstration of the target hor-
mone receptor is necessary for their use, in other cases such prostate 
cancer (androgen receptor) and lymphoid neoplasms (glucocorticoid 
receptor), the relevant receptor is always present in the tumor.

Glucocorticoids  are  generally  given  in  “pulsed”  high  doses  in 
leukemias  and  lymphomas,  where  they  induce  cell  death  in  tumor 
cells.  Cushing’s  syndrome  and  inadvertent  adrenal  suppression  on 
withdrawal from high-dose glucocorticoids can be significant compli-
cations, along with infections common in immunosuppressed patients, 
in particular Pneumocystis pneumonia, which classically appears a few 
days after completing a course of high-dose glucocorticoids.

Tamoxifen  is  a  partial  estrogen  receptor  antagonist;  it  antagonizes 
in  breast  tumors,  mirroring  its  effect  on  breast  tissue,  but  owing  to 
agonistic activities in vascular and uterine tissue, side effects include 
increased  risk  of  thromboembolic  phenomena  and  a  small  increased 
incidence of endometrial carcinoma, which appears after chronic use 
(usually  >5  years).  Progestational  agents—including  medroxyproges-
terone  acetate,  androgens  including  fluoxymesterone  (Halotestin), 
and,  paradoxically,  estrogens—have  approximately  the  same  degree 
of activity in primary hormonal treatment of breast cancers that have 
elevated expression of estrogen receptor protein. Estrogen itself is not 
used often due to prominent cardiovascular and uterotropic activity.

Aromatase refers to a family of enzymes that catalyze the formation 
of  estrogen  in  various  tissues,  including  ovary,  peripheral  adipose 
tissue,  and  some  tumor  cells.  Aromatase  inhibitors  are  of  two  types: 
irreversible  steroid  analogues  such  as  exemestane  and  the  reversible 
inhibitors  such  as  anastrozole  and  letrozole.  Anastrozole  is  superior 
to tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmeno-
pausal  patients  with  estrogen  receptor–positive  tumors.  Letrozole 
treatment  affords  benefit  following  tamoxifen  treatment.  Adverse 
effects of aromatase inhibitors may include an increased risk of osteo-
porosis, fatigue, and altered serum lipids.

Metastatic prostate cancer is treated primarily by androgen depriva-
tion. Orchiectomy causes responses in 80% of patients. If not accepted 
by  the  patient,  testicular  androgen  suppression  can  also  be  induced 
by luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   543

21/01/22   3:48 PM

 
 
 
 
544

leuprolide and goserelin. These agents cause tonic stimulation of the 
LHRH receptor, with loss of normal pulsatile activation resulting in net 
decreased output of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. 
Therefore, as primary hormonal manipulation in prostate cancer, one 
can choose orchiectomy or an LHRH agonist, but not both. This path-
way can also be blocked by relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone antagonist.

The addition of androgen receptor blockers, including flutamide or 
bicalutamide,  is  of  uncertain  additional  benefit  in  extending  overall 
response  duration,  although  pretreatment  with  these  agents  before 
LHRH  agonists  is  important  to  avoid  a  surge  in  testosterone  after 
initial LH release. Enzalutamide also binds to the androgen receptor 
and  antagonizes  androgen  action  in  a  mechanistically  distinct  way. 
Somewhat  analogous  to  inhibitors  of  aromatase,  agents  have  been 
derived  that  inhibit  testosterone  and  other  androgen  synthesis  in 
the  testis,  adrenal  gland,  and  prostate  tissue.  Abiraterone  inhibits  
17  α-hydroxylase/C17,20  lyase  (CYP17A1)  and  has  been  shown  to 
be active in prostate cancer patients experiencing progression despite 
androgen blockade.

Tumors that respond to a primary hormonal manipulation may fre-
quently respond to second and third hormonal manipulations. Thus, 
breast  tumors  that  had  previously  responded  to  tamoxifen  have,  on 
relapse, notable response rates to withdrawal of tamoxifen itself or to 
subsequent addition of an aromatase inhibitor or progestin. Likewise, 
initial  treatment  of  prostate  cancers  with  leuprolide  plus  flutamide 
may be followed after disease progression by response to withdrawal of 
flutamide. These responses may result from the removal of antagonists 
from mutant steroid hormone receptors that have come to depend on 
the presence of the antagonist as a growth-promoting influence.

Non-Receptor-Linked Tyrosine Kinase Antagonists  Table 73-6 
lists  currently  approved  non–hormone  receptor  pathway-directed 
molecularly  targeted  chemotherapy  agents,  with  features  of  their 
use of import to the generalist, particularly in recognizing potential 
drug-induced  morbidities  and  interactions  with  other  classes  of 
drugs.  The  basis  for  discovery  of  drugs  of  this  type  was  the  prior 
knowledge  of  oncogene-directed  pathways  driving  tumor  growth 
(Fig.  73-3).  In  most  cases,  non-receptor  tyrosine  kinases  ultimately 
activate  signaling  through  the  RAF/MEK/MAP  kinase  cascade, 
in  common  with  the  receptor-linked  tyrosine  kinases.  Diagnostic 
demonstration  of  an  active  non-receptor  tyrosine  kinase  may  guide 
selection of an agent. A repeated preclinical and clinical observation 
in a variety of tumor types is that mutational activation of the tyrosine 
kinase target induces a state of “oncogene addiction” on the part of the 
tumor. This then is the basis for a “synthetic lethal” effect of the kinase 
inhibitor with respect to tumor viability.

In hematologic tumors, the prototypic agent of this type is imatinib, 
which  targets  the  ATP  binding  site  of  the  p210bcr-abl  protein  tyrosine 
kinase that is formed as the result of the chromosome 9;22 transloca-
tion producing the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leu-
kemia (CML). It has lesser activity in the blast phase of CML, where the 
cells may have acquired additional mutations in p210bcr-abl itself or other 
genetic lesions. Its side effects are relatively tolerable in most patients 
and include hepatic dysfunction, diarrhea, and fluid retention. Rarely, 
patients  receiving  imatinib  have  decreased  cardiac  function,  which 
may persist after discontinuation of the drug. The quality of response 
to imatinib enters into the decision about when to refer patients with 
CML  for  consideration  of  stem  cell  transplant  approaches.  Nilotinib 
is  a  tyrosine  protein  kinase  inhibitor  with  activity  against  p210bcr-abl 
but  with  increased  potency  and  perhaps  better  tolerance  by  certain 
patients.  Dasatinib,  another  inhibitor  of  the  p210bcr-abl  oncoproteins, 
also  has  activity  against  certain  mutant  variants  of  p210bcr-abl  that  are 
refractory to imatinib and arise during therapy or are present de novo. 
Dasatinib  also  has  inhibitory  action  against  kinases  belonging  to  the 
src  tyrosine  protein  kinase  family;  this  activity  may  contribute  to  its 
effects. The T315I mutant of p210bcr-abl is resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, 
bosutinib,  and  dasatinib;  ponatinib  has  activity  in  patients  with  this 
T315Ip210bcr-abl, but ponatinib has noteworthy associated thromboem-
bolic toxicity. Use of this class of targeted agents is thus critically guided 

not only by the presence of the p210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, but also by the 
presence of specific mutations in the ATP binding site.

Janus  kinases  (JAK)  1  and  2  are  mutated  in  certain  myeloprolif-
erative  states;  cytopenias  and  infrequent  arrhythmias  infrequently 
complicate the use of ruxolitinib, the prototypic JAK inhibitor. Bruton’s 
tyrosine  kinase  (BTK)  is  an  intrinsic  component  of  B-cell  antigen 
receptor  signaling  and  therefore  is  activate  in  many  types  of  prolif-
erating  B  cells.  Inhibitors  of  BTK,  including  ibrutinib,  acalabrutinib, 
and  zanubritinib,  have  noteworthy  activity  in  certain  lymphomas. 
Cytopenias and cardiac arrhythmias can occur, along with propensity 
to infection (indeed, the BTK was discovered as deficient in congen-
ital  hypogammaglobulinemia,  presenting  with  repeated  infections  in 
childhood). Initial use of the BTK inhibitors requires consideration of 
prophylaxis against tumor lysis syndrome in case of a robust lympho-
lytic effect of the agent.

Receptor-Linked  Tyrosine  Kinase  Antagonists  Mutated 
EGFR  drives  a  significant  fraction  of  non-small-cell  lung  cancers 
(NSCLCs). Erlotinib and gefitinib are the prototypic EGFR antagonists 
that,  in  early  clinical  trials,  showed  evidence  of  responses  in  a  small 
fraction of patients with NSCLC. Subsequent studies by clinical oncol-
ogists in an effort to understand the basis of these excellent responses 
found  that  the  probability  of  response  to  the  agents  was  markedly 
increased in patients with an activating EGFR mutation, and current 
practice now routinely profiles patients with NSCLC for the presence 
of  sensitizing  mutations  of  EGFR.  Side  effects  were  generally  accept-
able, consisting mostly of acneiform rash (treated with glucocorticoid 
creams  and  clindamycin  gel)  and  diarrhea.  Patients  with  activating 
mutations  who  initially  responded  to  gefitinib  or  erlotinib  but  who 
then had progression of the disease then acquired additional mutations 
in  the  enzyme,  analogous  to  the  mutational  variants  responsible  for 
imatinib resistance in CML. Subsequent generations of EGFR antago-
nists have activity against more uncommon mutants (osimertinib) or a 
biochemically irreversible mechanism (dacomitinib).

Mutated  anaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  (ALK)  and  activated  RET 
oncogene likewise drive distinct fractions of NSCLCs. Crizotinib, alec-
tinib, and lorlatinib target ALK, but have prominent adverse cardiac, 
metabolic, and, in the case of lorlatinib, pulmonary events. Selperca-
tinib targets RET in NSCLCs (and thyroid cancers) but also with the 
chance of cardiac and liver toxicity.

Steel  factor,  a  blood  cell  precursor–related  bone  marrow  growth 
factor, uses the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. KIT and variants of the 
platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor  (PDGFR)  are  expressed  in 
gastrointestinal stromal sarcoma (GIST). In addition to anti-p210bcr-abl 
kinase activity, imatinib also inhibits mutants of KIT and PDGFR. Ima-
tinib has found clinical utility in GIST, a tumor previously notable for 
its refractoriness to chemotherapeutic approaches. Imatinib’s degree of 
activity varies with the specific mutational variant of KIT or PDGFR 
present in a particular patient’s tumor.

HER2-driven breast cancers may be usefully treated with lapatinib; 
diarrhea and cardiac dysfunction can occur. Neratinib or tucatinib may 
also be useful in HER2-positive breast cancers after trastuzumab has 
ceased to be of value; diarrhea and liver toxicity also require monitor-
ing and management.

Alteration of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling can contrib-
ute to the growth of urothelial carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas. 
Erdafitinib and pemigatinib, respectively, may be of utility with careful 
attention  to  ocular  toxicity  and  hyperphosphatemia;  the  latter  is  an 
“on-target” toxicity of disrupting FGF receptor signaling in the kidney. 
Likewise,  gilteritinib  is  active  against  the  FMS-like  tyrosine  kinase-3 
(FLT3)  mutated  in  a  fraction  of  poor-prognosis  (treated  by  conven-
tional  chemotherapy)  acute  myeloid  leukemias  (AMLs).  Cardiac, 
hepatic,  gastrointestinal,  and  neurologic  adverse  events  can  occur, 
along with “differentiation” of the AML cells with cytokine elaboration 
and pulmonary side effects, requiring management with steroids and 
potentially hydroxyurea.

The  neurotropic  tyrosine  kinase  receptor  (NRTK)  undergoes 
translocation with fusion to a variety of different partners to produce 
a family of chimeric proteins in a small fraction of a variety of solid

tumors.  Larotrectinib  and  entrectinib  may  be  quite  useful  in  man-
aging these tumors; indeed, these agents are exemplary of “histology 
agnostic” agents, where the utility of the drug is not tied to a particular 
histologic  diagnosis,  but  to  the  possession  of  a  specific  NRTK  gene 
alteration. Neurotoxicity, a long half-life of the agents, and hepatotoxic 
adverse  events  are  of  concern.  Also,  assuring  that  solid  tumors  have 
been appropriately screened for the existence of such sensitizing muta-
tions can be logistically and economically challenging.

RAS/RAF/MEK  Antagonists  The  BRAF  V600E  mutation 
drives  a  substantial  fraction  of  melanomas  and  certain  NSCLCs  and 
has been detected in certain thyroid tumors, colorectal tumors, hairy 
cell  leukemias,  and  unusual  gliomas.  BRAF  inhibitors  such  as  dab-
rafenib, vemurafenib, and encorafenib have activity as single agents in 
many such tumors but are usually most active when co-administered as 
“doublets” with the MEK inhibitors trametinib, cobimetinib, and bin-
imetinib, respectively, to promote “shut down” of RAF/MEK signaling 
at  more  than  pathway  member.  Cutaneous  adverse  events  including 
generally indolent cutaneous second neoplasms and thromboembolic, 
cardiac, and ocular toxicity can occur.

Sotorasib is a first-in-class inhibitor of KRAS G12C signaling that 
in  early  clinical  reports  has  evidence  of  effecting  stable  disease  in 
patients with a variety of neoplasm histologies bearing that mutation, 
with  fewer  actual  responses.  Its  initial  very  favorable  safety  profile 
encourages  further  clinical  investigations  alone  and  in  combination 
with other agents.

Multikinase  Inhibitors  Agents  in  this  class  also  target  specific 
macromolecules  promoting  the  viability  of  tumor  cells.  They  are 
“small-molecule” ATP site-directed antagonists that inhibit more than 
one protein kinase and may have value in the treatment of several solid 
tumors. Drugs of this type with prominent activity against the VEGFR 
tyrosine  kinase  have  activity  in  renal  cell  carcinoma.  Sorafenib  is  a 
VEGFR antagonist also with activity against the RAF serine-threonine 
protein kinase, and regorafenib is a closely related drug with value in 
relapsed  advanced  colon  cancer.  Pazopanib  also  prominently  targets 
VEGFR and has activity in renal carcinoma and soft tissue sarcomas. 
Sunitinib  has  anti-VEGFR,  anti-PDGFR,  and  anti-KIT  activity.  It 
causes  prominent  responses  and  stabilization  of  disease  in  renal  cell 
cancers  and  GISTs.  Side  effects  for  agents  with  anti-VEGFR  activity, 
similar to those of the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, prominently 
include hypertension, proteinuria, and, more rarely, bleeding and clot-
ting disorders, perforation of scarred gastrointestinal lesions, and pos-
terior leukoencephalopathy, probably reflecting CNS vascular damage. 
Also encountered are fatigue, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome, with 
erythema  and  desquamation  of  the  distal  extremities,  in  some  cases 
requiring dose modification, particularly with sorafenib.

Other agents in this class include agents such as brigatinib (clinical 
activity in ALK-dependent NSCLC, but also with anti-EGFR action), 
entrectinib (clinical activity in NTRK fusion protein diseases, but also 
in  ROS-mutated  NSCLC),  and  fedratinib  (clinical  activity  in  myelo-
proliferative neoplasms, but with RET activity in addition to JAK2 and 
FLT3 antagonism).

Cyclin-Dependent  Kinase 
Inhibitors  Cyclin-dependent 
kinases (CDKs) are activated as the result of oncogene pathway activity, 
and CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor-
suppressor gene to allow entry into S-phase. Palbociclib, abemaciclib, 
and ribociclib, selective inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6, have notewor-
thy  activity  in  advanced  breast  cancers  also  expressing  the  estrogen 
receptor,  usually  in  conjunction  with  continued  efforts  to  suppress 
estrogen receptor signaling, and frequently in conjunction with mTOR 
inhibitors.  Further  clinical  investigations  in  other  RB  intact  tumors 
may broaden their role.

Protein  Homeostasis  Modulators  The  proteasome  is  a  mac-
romolecular  complex  that  degrades  misfolded  proteins  tagged  for 
removal  by  ubiquitin  ligases.  Proteasome  inhibitors  were  originally 
designed  as  potential  anti-inflammatory  agents  owing  to  proteasome 
activity  to  produce  inflammatory  cytokines  but  had  unexpected 

antiproliferative activity in a variety of cell types. Proteasome inhibitors 
have  clinical  utility  in  myeloma  and  lymphoma,  where  unbalanced 
synthesis  of  immunoglobulin  components  can  accumulate  after  pro-
teasome  inhibitor  treatment  and  induce  apoptosis  or  starve  cells  for 
amino acids, inducing autophagy. Boronic acid proteasome inhibitors, 
including  bortezomib  and  ixazomib,  cause  thrombocytopenia,  gas-
trointestinal  dysfunction,  and  neuropathy.  Carfilzomib  is  a  distinct 
chemotype  with  attenuated  neuropathy  but  increased  incidence  of 
infusion reactions and cytokine release, with attendant risk of cardio-
pulmonary adverse events.

Exportin 1 is a nuclear membrane transport protein that is responsi-
ble for normal exit and entry of a variety of nuclear proteins. Selinexor 
is an inhibitor of exportin action, resulting in abnormal nuclear accu-
mulation  of,  e.g.,  tumor-suppressor  gene  products  or  needed  export 
of other products, e.g., oncogene products. Useful clinical activity has 
been seen in myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas including 
those arising from previously treated indolent lymphomas. Cytopenias, 
gastrointestinal  distress,  and  hyponatremia  are  features  of  its  clinical 
use.

Chromatin-Modifying Agents  Gene function is altered not only 
by  mutation  of  DNA  structure,  but  also  by  “epigenetic”  mechanisms 
that alter the capacity of DNA to be transcribed or interact with reg-
ulatory proteins in the nucleus including transcription factors. Initial 
epigenetic approaches to modulate gene expression extended from the 
observation  that  low  concentrations  of  certain  nucleosides  (5′azacy-
tidine  and  decitabine)  caused  loss  of  methylated  cytosine  in  DNA, 
associated with gene silencing, and had clinical activity in causing dif-
ferentiation of AML cells with notably less toxicity than higher concen-
trations. 5′Azacytidine and decitabine are misincorporated into DNA 
and then scavenge DNA methyl transferase to disable DNA methyla-
tion of tumor-promoting genes and thus alter their transcription.

Histone  deacetylase  inhibitors  alter  the  histone  protein  “packing” 
density of chromatin and induce global changes in expression of cell 
cycle  regulatory  proteins.  Vorinostat,  belinostat,  and  romidepsin  are 
useful  in  cutaneous  and  peripheral  T-cell  lymphomas;  panobinostat 
has activity in multiple myeloma. The agents are generally well toler-
ated  but  with  the  potential  for  cytopenias.  The  histone  methyltrans-
ferase  inhibitor  tazemetostat  is  a  first-in-class  inhibitor  of  histone 
methyltransferase  with  unique  activity  in  epithelioid  sarcoma  owing 
to its modulation of transcriptional mechanisms unique to that tumor 
and, recently, in certain follicular lymphomas.

Cancer  Cell  Metabolism  Modulators  Oncogenic  transforma-
tion  causes  a  “rewiring”  of  cellular  metabolism  away  from  oxidative 
phosphorylation  to  glycolysis  (historically  defined  as  the  “Warburg 
effect” of aerobic glycolysis in animal and human tumors) with atten-
dant tolerance of hypoxia and production of metabolites important for 
sustaining cell proliferation. Recent clinical studies have defined clini-
cal value from inhibitors of the cell lipid membrane localized phospho-
inositide-3 (PI3) kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
(the  latter  is  a  kinase  whose  inhibition  was  originally  discovered  as 
the mechanism by which the immunosuppressant rapamycin, isolated 
from  a  soil  bacterium,  decreased  T-cell  proliferation).  PI3  kinase  is 
activated by numerous oncogenic tyrosine kinases to ultimately cause 
a cascade of metabolic alterations including increased glucose uptake 
and activation of mTOR isoforms, which selectively increase transla-
tion efficiency of key regulators of cell cycle progression and protein 
synthetic capacity.

Temsirolimus  and  everolimus  are  mTOR  inhibitors  with  activity 
in  renal  cancers.  They  produce  stomatitis  and  fatigue;  some  hyper-
lipidemia  (10%)  and  myelosuppression  (10%);  and  rare  lung  toxicity 
and  immunosuppression  in  regimens  used  clinically.  Everolimus  is 
also useful in patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancers 
displaying resistance to hormonal inhibition and in certain neuroen-
docrine and brain tumors, the latter arising in patients with sporadic 
or  inherited  mutations  in  the  pathway  activating  mTOR.  Isoform- 
specific  PI3  kinase  inhibitors  are  of  increasing  importance  in  breast 
cancers with mutated PI3Kα (alpelisib; hyperglycemia and cutaneous

eruptions can occur) or owing to selective use of PI3Kδ by lymphoid 
tissues in lymphomas (idelalisib, copanlisib, and duvelisib).

Isocitrate  dehydrogenase  (IDH)  inhibitors  (ivosidenib  specific  for 
IDH1 and enasidenib specific for IDH2) have activity in tumors with 
IDH mutants (AML, cholangiocarcinomas) that generate the “oncom-
etabolite” 2-hydroxyglutarate, which alters DNA and histone methyl-
transferase  activity.  The  drugs  thus  function  indirectly  as  epigenetic 
chromatin modulating agents through effects on cellular metabolism.

DNA  Repair  Pathway  Modulators  DNA  repair  systems  act 
physiologically  to  lessen  the  impact  of  environmental  genomic  dam-
aging agents and influence the susceptibility to certain chemotherapy 
agents. DNA repair enzyme mutations underlie inherited cancer sus-
ceptibility syndromes such as mutated BRCA tumor-suppressor gene–
associated breast and ovarian cancers, among others.

Laboratory  investigations  revealed  that  poly-ADP  ribose  poly-
merase  (PARP)  acts  as  a  synthetic  lethal  gene  with  mutations  in  the 
homologous recombination repair pathway, including the BRCA gene. 
PARP  responds  to  detection  of  DNA  lesions  by  creating  chains  of 
poly-ADP, which serve as scaffolds for the localization of DNA repair 
proteins still active even with mutated BRCA isoforms. However, with-
out  PARP  activity,  the  scaffolds  cannot  form,  and  the  DNA  damage 
becomes lethal. This observation immediately suggested the potential 
utility  of  PARP  inhibitors  (e.g.,  olaparib)  as  treatments  potentially 
useful for BRCA-induced tumors. Recently, PARP inhibitor utility has 
been extended to tumors that do not harbor BRCA mutations but have 
given evidence of responding to platinum drugs, as a way of extending 
the useful effect of the chemotherapy treatment. This finding under-
scores the likelihood that sensitivity to DNA-directed cytotoxic drugs 
on the part of a tumor is at least in part related to the drugs’ ability to 
take  advantage  of  a  sensitizing  effect  of  a  tumor’s  endogenous  DNA 
repair capacity.

Miscellaneous Targeted Therapies  The  t(15;17)  chromosomal 
translocation  is  diagnostic  of  acute  promyelocytic  leukemia  (APL),  a 
subset of AML. The translocation produces a chimeric fusion protein 
joining the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α to the transcription factor 
PML.  The  abnormal  protein,  encoding  PML-RARα,  blocks  differ-
entiation  of  the  cancer  cells.  All-trans-retinoic  acid  (ATRA)  binds  to 
the  chimeric  protein,  releasing  the  block  to  differentiation  inducing 
response in APL with fewer complications from cytopenias and disor-
dered coagulation seen with cytotoxic agents. Its use can be attended 
by a “differentiation syndrome” characterized by cytokine release from 
and organ infiltration by the tumor cells. Pulmonary function can be 
severely  compromised  but  is  generally  responsive  to  glucocorticoids. 
Increased intracranial pressure can occur from ATRA, and headache 
should occasion fundoscopic exam.

Arsenic trioxide was found empirically to also be of value in treating 
APL,  and  further  study  revealed  that  it  also  modulates  PML-RARα 
levels, along with decreasing the tolerance of APL cells for free radical 
damage, inducing apoptosis. The combination of arsenic trioxide and 
ATRA is productive of very high rates of complete remission in APL. 
Arsenic trioxide can cause lengthening of the QT interval, and careful 
attention  to  concomitant  medications,  Mg2+,  ionized  Ca2+,  and  K+  is 
necessary during treatment.

The sonic hedgehog transcription factor pathway is regulated by the 
WNT ligands, which are active during embryonic and fetal life and in 
certain neoplasms. The sonic hedgehog inhibitors sonidegib and glas-
degib  are  useful  in  non–surgically  treatable  cutaneous  basal  cell  car-
cinomas and certain AMLs, respectively, where the pathway is active.

High-affinity binding to receptors on tumor cells can deliver toxins 
to tumor cells, exemplified by the IL-3–diphtheria toxin fusion protein 
tagraxofusp-erzs,  targeting  the  IL-3  receptor  (CD123)  and  useful  in 
blastic  plasmacytoid  dendritic  cell  neoplasms.  Capillary  leak  syn-
drome  induced  by  the  toxin  component  requires  careful  monitoring 
of fluid balance to avoid pulmonary dysfunction in particular. Specific 
receptors for cytokines and growth factors can also serve as “traps” to 
sequester  needed  growth  factors.  Ziv-aflibercept  is  not  an  antibody, 
but a solubilized VEGF receptor VEGF binding domain, and therefore 

may have a distinct mechanism of action from bevacizumab, but with 
comparable side effects.
 ■ SYSTEMIC RADIATION THERAPY
Systemically administered isotopes of iodide have an important role in 
the treatment of thyroid neoplasms, owing to the selective upregulation 
of  the  iodide  transporter  in  the  tumor  cell  compartment.  Likewise, 
isotopes of samarium and radium have been found useful in the pal-
liation  of  bony  metastases  of  prostate  cancer  owing  to  their  selective 
deposition at the tumor-bone matrix interface. Antibody-radioisotope 
complexes such as Y90-ibritumomab-tiuxetan target CD20, are useful 
in treating lymphoma, or an isotope can be complexed to a ligand for 
which the tumor has high affinity. The latter strategy is employed by 
Lu177-dotatate,  where  an  analog  of  somatostatin  brings  the  lutetium 
isotope  close  to  tumors  such  as  somatostatin  receptor–positive  gas-
troenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

RESISTANCE TO CANCER TREATMENTS
Resistance  mechanisms  to  the  conventional  cytotoxic  agents  were 
initially characterized in the late twentieth century as defects in drug 
uptake, metabolism, or export by tumor cells. The multidrug resistance 
(MDR)  gene,  encoding  P-glycoprotein  (Pgp),  is  prototypic  of  trans-
port  proteins  that  efficiently  excrete  many  drugs  from  tumor  cells; 
no clinically useful modulator of this process has yet emerged. Drug- 
metabolizing  enzymes  such  as  cytidine  deaminase  are  upregulated 
in resistant tumor cells, and this is the basis for so-called “high-dose 
cytarabine” regimens in the treatment of leukemia. Another resistance 
mechanism defined during this era involved increased expression of a 
drug’s target, exemplified by amplification of the dihydrofolate reduc-
tase  gene,  in  patients  who  had  lost  responsiveness  to  methotrexate, 
or  mutation  of  topoisomerase  II  in  tumors  that  relapsed  after  topoi-
somerase II modulator treatment.

A second class of resistance mechanisms involves loss of the cellular 
apoptotic mechanism activated after the engagement of a drug’s target 
by the drug. This occurs in a way that is heavily influenced by the biol-
ogy of the particular tumor type. For example, decreased alkylguanine 
alkyltransferase  expression  defines  a  subset  of  glioblastoma  patients 
with the prospect of enhanced benefit from treatment with temozolo-
mide  but  has  no  value  in  predicting  benefit  from  temozolomide  in 
epithelial neoplasms. Likewise, ovarian cancers resistant to platinating 
agents have decreased expression of the proapoptotic gene BAX.

A related class of resistance mechanisms emerged from sequencing 
of the targets of agents directed at oncogenic kinases, revealing mutated 
targets,  as  described  previously.  This  relates  to  the  phenomenon  of 
tumor heterogeneity. Tumors harbor distinct populations of subclones 
that  arise  during  the  process  of  carcinogenesis,  sharing  to  variable 
degrees  mutations  that  may  promote  the  growth  of  some  subclones, 
but that are absent or are no longer relevant to the growth of other sub-
clones. Really useful targeted therapies address a target present in all 
subclones and to which all tumor subclones require for tumor growth.
Finally,  other  mechanisms  of  resistance  to  targeted  agents  include 
the upregulation of alternate means of activating the pathway targeted 
by  the  agent.  Thus,  melanomas  initially  responsive  to  BRAF  V600E 
antagonists  such  as  vemurafenib  may  reactivate  RAF  signaling  by 
employing variant isoforms that can bypass the drug. Likewise, inhibi-
tion of HER2/neu signaling in breast cancer cells can lead to the emer-
gence of variants with distinct ways of activating downstream effectors 
such as PI3 kinase.

SUPPORTIVE CARE DURING CANCER 
TREATMENT
 ■ MYELOSUPPRESSION
Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents almost invariably affect bone mar-
row function. Titration of this effect determines the tolerated dose of 
the agent on a given schedule. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; 
t1/2  =  6–8  h),  platelets  (t1/2  =  5–7  days),  and  red  blood  cells  (RBCs;  
t1/2 = 120 days) have most, less, and least susceptibility, respectively, to 
usually administered cytotoxic agents. The nadir count of each cell type

in response to classes of agents is characteristic. Maximal neutropenia 
occurs  6–14  days  after  conventional  doses  of  anthracyclines,  anti-
folates, and antimetabolites. Alkylating agents differ from each other 
in the timing of cytopenias. Nitrosoureas, DTIC, and procarbazine can 
display delayed marrow toxicity, first appearing 6 weeks after dosing.

Complications  of  myelosuppression  result  from  the  predictable 
sequelae of the missing cells’ function. Febrile neutropenia refers to the 
clinical presentation of fever and <1500 granulocytes/μL. Management 
of febrile neutropenia is considered in Chap. 74. Transfusion of gran-
ulocytes has no role in the management of febrile neutropenia, owing 
to  their  exceedingly  short  half-life,  mechanical  fragility,  and  clinical 
syndromes of pulmonary compromise with leukostasis after their use. 
Instead, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are used to augment bone 
marrow production of PMNs. The American Society of Clinical Oncol-
ogy has developed practice guidelines for the use of granulocyte CSF 
(G-CSF) and GM-CSF (Table 73-7).

Dangerous degrees of thrombocytopenia do not frequently compli-
cate the management of patients with solid tumors receiving cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  (with  the  possible  exception  of  certain  carboplatin-
containing  regimens),  but  they  are  frequent  in  patients  with  certain 
hematologic neoplasms where marrow is infiltrated with tumor. Severe 
bleeding related to thrombocytopenia occurs with increased frequency 
at  platelet  counts  <20,000/μL  in  patients  with  acute  leukemia  and 
<10,000/μL  in  patients  with  solid  tumors  and  is  prevalent  at  counts 
<5000/μL.

The precise “trigger” point at which to transfuse patients has been 
defined as a platelet count of 10,000/μL or less in patients without med-
ical comorbidities that may increase the risk of bleeding. This issue is 
important not only because of the costs of frequent transfusion but also 
because unnecessary platelet transfusions expose the patient to the risks 
of  allosensitization  and  loss  of  value  from  subsequent  transfusion,  as 
well as the infectious and hypersensitivity risks inherent in any transfu-
sion. Prophylactic transfusions to keep platelets >20,000/μL are reason-
able in patients with leukemia who are stressed by fever or concomitant 
medical  conditions.  Careful  review  of  medication  lists  to  prevent 
exposure  to  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  agents  and  maintenance 
of clotting factor levels adequate to support near-normal prothrombin 
and partial thromboplastin time tests are important in minimizing the 
risk of bleeding in the thrombocytopenic patient.

Anemia associated with chemotherapy can be managed by transfu-
sion of packed RBCs. Transfusion is not undertaken until the hemo-
globin  falls  to  <80  g/L  (8  g/dL),  compromise  of  end-organ  function 
occurs, or an underlying condition (e.g., coronary artery disease) calls 
for maintenance of hemoglobin >90 g/L (9 g/dL). Randomized trials 
in certain tumors have raised the possibility that erythropoietin (EPO) 
use may promote tumor cell survival.

 ■ NAUSEA AND VOMITING
The  most  common  side  effect  of  chemotherapy  administration  is 
nausea, with or without vomiting. Nausea may be acute (within 24 h 
of  chemotherapy),  delayed  (>24  h),  or  anticipatory  of  the  receipt  of 
chemotherapy. Highly emetogenic drugs (risk of emesis >90%) include 
DTIC, cyclophosphamide at >1500 mg/m2,  and cisplatin; moderately 
emetogenic  drugs  (30–90%  risk)  include  carboplatin,  cytosine  arabi-
noside  (>1  g/m2),  ifosfamide,  conventional-dose  cyclophosphamide, 
and  anthracyclines;  low-risk  (10–30%)  agents  include  5-FU,  taxanes, 
etoposide,  and  bortezomib,  with  minimal  risk  (<10%)  afforded  by 
treatment with antibodies, bleomycin, busulfan, fludarabine, and vinca 
alkaloids.

Serotonin  antagonists  (5-HT3)  and  neurokinin  1  (NK1)  receptor 
antagonists  are  useful  in  “high-risk”  chemotherapy  regimens.  The 
combination  acts  at  both  peripheral  gastrointestinal  and  CNS  sites 
that  control  nausea  and  vomiting.  For  example,  the  5-HT3  blocker 
dolasetron,  100  mg  intravenously  or  orally;  dexamethasone,  12  mg; 
and the NK1 antagonist aprepitant, 125 mg orally, are combined on the 
day of administration of severely emetogenic regimens, with repetition 
of dexamethasone (8 mg) and aprepitant (80 mg) on days 2 and 3 for 
delayed  nausea.  Alternate  5-HT3  antagonists  include  ondansetron, 
given  as  0.15  mg/kg  intravenously  for  three  doses  just  before  and  at 
4  and  8  h  after  chemotherapy;  palonosetron  at  0.25  mg  over  30  s,  
30 min before chemotherapy; and granisetron, given as a single dose of 
0.01 mg/kg just before chemotherapy. Emesis from moderately emetic 
chemotherapy  regimens  may  be  prevented  with  a  5-HT3  antagonist 
and dexamethasone alone for patients not receiving doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide  combinations;  the  latter  combination  requires  the 
5-HT3/dexamethasone/aprepitant  on  day  1,  but  aprepitant  alone  on 
days 2 and 3. Emesis from low-emetic-risk regimens may be prevented 
with  8  mg  of  dexamethasone  alone  or  with  non-5-HT3,  non-NK1 
antagonist approaches including the following.

Antidopaminergic  phenothiazines  act  directly  at  the  chemorecep-
tor  trigger  zone  (CTZ)  in  the  brainstem  medulla  and  include  pro-
chlorperazine  (Compazine),  10  mg  intramuscularly  or  intravenously,  
10–25 mg orally, or 25 mg per rectum every 4–6 h for up to four doses;

and thiethylperazine, 10 mg by potentially all of the above routes every 
6  h.  Haloperidol  is  a  butyrophenone  dopamine  antagonist  given  at 
1  mg  intramuscularly  or  orally  every  8  h.  Metoclopramide  acts  on 
peripheral  dopamine  receptors  to  augment  gastric  emptying  and  is 
used in high doses for highly emetogenic regimens (1–2 mg/kg intra-
venously  30  min  before  chemotherapy  and  every  2  h  for  up  to  three 
additional doses as needed); intravenous doses of 10–20 mg every 4–6 
h as needed or 50 mg orally 4 h before and 8 and 12 h after chemo-
therapy  are  used  for  moderately  emetogenic  regimens.  5-9-Tetrahy-
drocannabinol  (Marinol)  is  a  rather  weak  antiemetic  compared  to 
other available agents, but it may be useful for persisting nausea and is 
used orally at 10 mg every 3–4 h as needed. Olanzapine, an “atypical 
antipsychotic”  acting  at  multiple  neurotransmitter  receptors,  may  be 
of  value,  most  clearly  in  cases  refractory  to  the  measures  described 
above. Some practice guidelines have endorsed its earlier use in adults 
receiving  highly  emetogenic  chemotherapy  regimens  in  combination 
with an NK1 antagonist plus an HT3 antagonist plus dexamethasone.

 ■ DIARRHEA
Similar  to  the  vomiting  syndromes,  chemotherapy-induced  diarrhea 
may be immediate or can occur in a delayed fashion up to 48–72 h after 
the  drugs.  Careful  attention  to  maintained  hydration  and  electrolyte 
repletion,  intravenously  if  necessary,  along  with  antimotility  treat-
ments such as “high-dose” loperamide (4 mg at the first occurrence of 
diarrhea, with 2 mg repeated every 2 h until 12 h without loose stools, 
not  to  exceed  a  total  daily  dose  of  16  mg),  are  appropriate.  Octreo-
tide  (100–150  μg),  a  somatostatin  analogue,  or  intralumenally  acting  
opiate-based preparations may be considered for patients not respond-
ing to loperamide.

 ■ MUCOSITIS
Irritation  and  inflammation  of  the  mucous  membranes  (mucosi-
tis)  particularly  afflicting  the  oral  and  anal  mucosa,  but  potentially 
involving  the  entire  gastrointestinal  tract,  may  accompany  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  Topical  therapies,  including  anesthetics  and  barrier- 
creating  preparations,  may  provide  symptomatic  relief  in  mild  cases. 
Palifermin, a keratinocyte growth factor and member of the fibroblast 
growth factor family, is effective in preventing severe mucositis in the 
setting of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation for 
hematologic malignancies. It may also prevent or ameliorate mucositis 
from radiation.

 ■ ALOPECIA
Chemotherapeutic agents vary widely in causing alopecia, with anthra-
cyclines,  alkylating  agents,  and  topoisomerase  inhibitors  reliably 
causing near-total alopecia when given at therapeutic doses. Antime-
tabolites are more variably associated with alopecia. Psychological sup-
port and the use of cosmetic resources are to be encouraged. “Chemo 
caps” that reduce scalp temperature to decrease the degree of alopecia 
are controversial during treatment with curative intent of neoplasms, 
such as leukemia or lymphoma, or in adjuvant breast cancer therapy. 
The richly vascularized scalp can certainly harbor micrometastatic or 
disseminated disease.

 ■ GONADAL DYSFUNCTION AND PREGNANCY
All  cancer  treatments  described  in  this  chapter  should  be  regarded 
as  potentially  injurious  to  the  developing  fetus  and  to  newborns  via 
lactation. However, there are gradations to the degree of reproductive 
harm.  All  agents  tend  to  have  increased  risk  of  adverse  outcomes 
when  administered  during  the  first  trimester,  and  strategies  to  delay 
chemotherapy, if possible, until after this milestone should be consid-
ered if the pregnancy is to continue to term. Patients in their second 
or third trimester can be treated with most regimens for the common 

neoplasms  afflicting  women  in  their  childbearing  years,  with  the 
exception of antimetabolites, particularly antifolates, which have nota-
ble teratogenic or fetotoxic effects throughout pregnancy. The need for 
anticancer chemotherapy per se is infrequently a clear basis to recom-
mend termination of a concurrent pregnancy, although each treatment 
strategy in this circumstance must be tailored to the individual needs 
of the patient.

Cessation  of  ovulation  and  azoospermia  reliably  result  from  regi-
mens  that  contain  alkylating  agents  and  topoisomerase  poison.  The 
duration of these effects varies with age and sex. Sperm banking before 
treatment  may  be  considered.  Females  experience  amenorrhea  with 
anovulation  after  alkylating  agent  therapy;  egg  preservation  may  be 
considered but may delay inception of urgent treatment. Recovery of 
normal menses is frequent if treatment is completed before age 30, but 
patients are unlikely to recover menses after age 35. Even those who 
regain menses usually experience premature menopause. Because the 
magnitude and extent of decreased fertility can be difficult to predict, 
patients  should  be  counseled  to  maintain  effective  contraception, 
preferably by barrier means, during and after therapy. Resumption of 
efforts to conceive should be considered in the context of the patient’s 
likely prognosis. Hormone replacement therapy should be undertaken 
in  women  who  do  not  have  a  hormonally  responsive  tumor.  For 
patients who have had a hormone-sensitive tumor primarily treated by 
a local modality, conventional practice would counsel against hormone 
replacement, but this issue is under investigation.

 ■ PALLIATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE CARE
An important perspective the primary care provider may bring to patients 
and their families facing incurable cancer is that, given the limited value 
of chemotherapeutic approaches at some point in the natural history of 
most metastatic cancers, palliative care or hospice-based approaches, with 
meticulous and ongoing attention to symptom relief and with family, psy-
chological, and spiritual support, should receive prominent attention as a 
valuable therapeutic plan (Chaps. 12 and 69). Optimizing the quality of 
life rather than attempting to extend it becomes a valued intervention. 
Patients  facing  the  impending  progression  of  disease  in  a  life-threat-
ening way frequently choose to undertake toxic treatments of little to 
no potential value, and support provided by the primary caregiver in 
accessing palliative and hospice-based options in contrast to receiving 
toxic and ineffective regimens can be critical in providing a basis for 
patients to make sensible choices.

Late effects of cancer and its treatment are reviewed in Chap. 95.

74 Infections in Patients  
with Cancer
Robert W. Finberg*

Infections are a common cause of death and an even more common 
cause  of  morbidity  in  patients  with  a  wide  variety  of  neoplasms. 
Infections  in  cancer  patients  can  result  directly  from  tissue  invasion 
by cancerous cells (either by replacement of healthy host marrow cells 
or by occlusion of an orifice) (Table 74-1) or as a result of treatment. 
In the era of cytotoxic chemotherapy, neutropenia as a result of che-
motherapy was the major cause of infectious complications of cancer 
therapy. The routine use of granulocyte-stimulating cytokines has, in 
most cases, shortened the duration of neutropenia, and the increasing 
use  of  checkpoint  inhibitors  and  chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)  T 
cells  has  changed  the  field  of  oncology  and  led  to  better  outcomes. 
Unfortunately, checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulators are also 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  infections—particularly  intracel-
lular pathogens. An evolving approach to prevention and treatment of 
infectious complications of cancer has decreased infection-associated 
mortality rates and will probably continue to do so. This accomplish-
ment has resulted from three major steps:

1.  Early  treatment:  The  practice  of  using  early  empirical  antibiotics 
reduced  mortality  rates  among  patients  with  leukemia  and  bacte-
remia from 84% in 1965 to 44% in 1972. The mortality rate due to 
infection in febrile neutropenic patients dropped to <10% by 2013. 
This dramatic improvement is attributed to early intervention with 
appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

2.  Empirical  treatment:  “Empirical”  antifungal  therapy  has  also  low-
ered the incidence of disseminated fungal infection, with dramatic 
decreases in mortality rates. An antifungal agent is administered—
on  the  basis  of  likely  fungal  infection—to  neutropenic  patients 
who, after 4–7 days of antibiotic therapy, remain febrile but have no 
positive cultures.

3.  Prophylaxis:  Use  of  antibiotics  for  afebrile  neutropenic  patients 
as  broad-spectrum  prophylaxis  against  infections  has  decreased 
both  mortality  and  morbidity  even  further.  The  current  approach 
to treatment of severely neutropenic patients (e.g., those receiving 
high-dose  chemotherapy  for  leukemia  or  high-grade  lymphoma) 
is  based  on  initial  prophylactic  therapy  at  the  onset  of  neutrope-
nia,  subsequent  “empirical”  antibacterial  therapy  targeting  the 

organisms whose involvement is likely in light of physical findings 
(most often fever alone), and finally “empirical” antifungal therapy 
based on the known likelihood that fungal infection will become a 
serious issue after 4–7 days of broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy.

A  physical  predisposition  to  infection  in  patients  with  cancer  
(Table 74-1) can be a result of the neoplasm’s production of a break in 
the skin. For example, a squamous cell carcinoma may cause local inva-
sion of the epidermis, which allows bacteria to gain access to subcuta-
neous  tissue  and  permits  the  development  of  cellulitis.  The  artificial 
closing  of  a  normally  patent  orifice  can  also  predispose  to  infection; 
for example, obstruction of a ureter by a tumor can cause urinary tract 
infection, and obstruction of the bile duct can cause cholangitis. Part of 
the host’s normal defense against infection depends on the continuous 
emptying of a viscus; without emptying, a few bacteria that are present 
as a result of bacteremia or local transit can multiply and cause disease.
A similar problem can affect patients whose lymph node integrity 
has been disrupted by radical surgery, particularly patients who have 
had  radical  node  dissections.  A  common  clinical  problem  following 
radical mastectomy is the development of cellulitis (usually caused by 
streptococci or staphylococci) because of lymphedema and/or inade-
quate lymph drainage. In most cases, this problem can be addressed by 
local measures designed to prevent fluid accumulation and breaks in 
the skin, but antibiotic prophylaxis has been used in refractory cases.

A life-threatening problem common to many cancer patients is the 
loss  of  the  reticuloendothelial  capacity  to  clear  microorganisms  after 
splenectomy, which may be performed as part of the management of 
hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic 
myelogenous leukemia (CML) as well as Hodgkin’s disease. Even after 
curative therapy for the underlying disease, the lack of a spleen predis-
poses  such  patients  to  rapidly  fatal  infections.  The  loss  of  the  spleen 
through trauma similarly predisposes the normal host to overwhelming 
infection throughout life. The splenectomized patient should be coun-
seled about the risks of infection with certain organisms, such as the 
protozoan Babesia (Chap. 225) and Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a bac-
terium carried in the mouths of animals (Chaps. 141 and 158). Because 
encapsulated  bacteria  (Streptococcus  pneumoniae,  Haemophilus  influ-
enzae,  and  Neisseria  meningitidis)  are  the  organisms  most  commonly 
associated with postsplenectomy sepsis, splenectomized persons should 
be vaccinated (and revaccinated; Table 74-2 and Chap. 123) against the 
capsular  polysaccharides  of  these  organisms.  Many  clinicians  recom-
mend giving splenectomized patients a small supply of antibiotics effec-
tive against S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae to avert 
rapid,  overwhelming  sepsis  in  the  event  that  they  cannot  present  for 
medical attention immediately after the onset of fever or other signs or

aThe latest recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the CDC guidelines can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. bA single dose of 
TDaP (tetanus–diphtheria–acellular pertussis), followed by a booster dose of Td (tetanus–diphtheria) every 10 years, is recommended for adults. cLive-virus vaccine is 
contraindicated; inactivated vaccine should be used. dTwo types of vaccines are used to prevent pneumococcal disease. A conjugate vaccine active against 13 serotypes 
(13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV13) is currently administered in three separate doses to all children. A polysaccharide vaccine active against 23 
serotypes (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, or PPSV23) elicits titers of antibody lower than those achieved with the conjugate vaccine, and immunity may 
wane more rapidly. Because the ablative chemotherapy given to recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) eradicates immunologic memory, revaccination 
is recommended for all such patients. Vaccination is much more effective once immunologic reconstitution has occurred; however, because of the need to prevent serious 
disease, pneumococcal vaccine should be administered 6–12 months after transplantation in most cases. Because PPSV23 includes serotypes not present in PCV13, HSCT 
recipients should receive a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the last dose of PCV13. Although antibody titers from PPSV23 clearly decay, experience with multiple 
doses of PPSV23 is limited, as are data on the safety, toxicity, or efficacy of such a regimen. For this reason, the CDC currently recommends the administration of one 
additional dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years after the last dose to immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients, as well as patients with Hodgkin’s disease, 
multiple myeloma, lymphoma, or generalized malignancies. Beyond this single additional dose, further doses are not recommended at this time. eMeningococcal conjugate 
vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended for adults ≤55 years old, and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is recommended for those ≥56 years old. fVaricella 
vaccine is recommended for children and zoster recombinant vaccine for adults. gContact the manufacturer for more information on use in children with acute lymphocytic 
leukemia.

symptoms of bacterial infection. A few tablets of amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid (or levofloxacin if resistant strains of S. pneumoniae are prevalent 
locally) are a reasonable choice for this purpose.

The level of suspicion of infections with certain organisms depends 
on  the  type  of  cancer  diagnosed  (Table  74-3).  Diagnosis  of  multi-
ple  myeloma  or  CLL  should  alert  the  clinician  to  the  possibility  of 
hypogammaglobulinemia. While immunoglobulin replacement therapy 
can  be  effective,  in  most  cases,  prophylactic  antibiotics  are  a  cheaper, 
more  convenient  method  of  eliminating  bacterial  infections  in  CLL 
patients  with  hypogammaglobulinemia.  Patients  with  acute  lympho-
cytic leukemia (ALL), patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and all 
cancer patients treated with high-dose glucocorticoids (or glucocorticoid- 
containing  chemotherapy  regimens)  should  receive  antibiotic  pro-
phylaxis  for  Pneumocystis  infection  (Table  74-3)  for  the  duration  of 
their chemotherapy. In addition to exhibiting susceptibility to certain 
infectious organisms, patients with cancer are likely to manifest their 

infections in characteristic ways. For example, fever—generally a sign 
of  infection  in  normal  hosts—continues  to  be  a  reliable  indicator  in 
neutropenic  patients.  In  contrast,  patients  receiving  glucocorticoids 
and  agents  that  impair  T-cell  function  and  cytokine  secretion  may 
have serious infections in the absence of fever. Similarly, neutropenic 
patients commonly present with cellulitis without purulence and with 
pneumonia without sputum or even x-ray findings (see below).

The use of monoclonal antibodies that target B and T cells as well 
as drugs that interfere with lymphocyte signal transduction events are 
associated with reactivation of latent infections. The use of infliximab 
and  other  anti-tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  antibodies  are  associated 
with the development of reactivation tuberculosis. Similarly, the use of 
the  anti-B  cell  antibody,  retuximab,  is  associated  with  reactivation  of 
hepatitis B and other latent viruses. Checkpoint inhibitors also predis-
pose  individuals  to  reactivation  of  intracellular  pathogens,  and  clini-
cians must be aware of what viruses and other intracellular organisms

(mycobacteria,  fungi,  etc.)  are  likely  to  grow  and  pose  a  threat  to  an 
individual  patient  receiving  these  therapies.  Like  organ  transplant 
recipients (Chap. 143), patients with latent bacterial disease (like tuber-
culosis) and latent viral disease (like herpes simplex or zoster) should be 
carefully monitored for reactivation disease.
SYSTEM-SPECIFIC SYNDROMES
 ■ SKIN-SPECIFIC SYNDROMES
Skin  lesions  are  common  in  cancer  patients,  and  the  appearance  of 
these lesions may permit the diagnosis of systemic bacterial or fungal 
infection. While cellulitis caused by skin organisms such as Streptococ-
cus or Staphylococcus is common, neutropenic patients—that is, those 
with <500 functional polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)/μL—and 
patients with impaired blood or lymphatic drainage may develop infec-
tions  with  unusual  organisms.  Innocent-looking  macules  or  papules 
may be the first sign of bacterial or fungal sepsis in immunocompro-
mised patients (Fig. 74-1). In the neutropenic host, a macule progresses 
rapidly to ecthyma gangrenosum (see Fig. A1-34), a usually painless, 
round, necrotic lesion consisting of a central black or gray-black eschar 
with surrounding erythema. Ecthyma gangrenosum, which is located 
in nonpressure areas (as distinguished from necrotic lesions associated 
with lack of circulation), is often associated with Pseudomonas aerug-
inosa bacteremia (Chap. 164) but may be caused by other bacteria.

Candidemia  (Chap.  216)  is  also  associated  with  a  variety  of  skin 
conditions (see Fig. A1-37) and commonly presents as a maculopapu-
lar rash. Punch biopsy of the skin may be the best method for diagnosis.
Cellulitis,  an  acute  spreading  inflammation  of  the  skin,  is  most  often 
caused by infection with group A Streptococcus or  Staphylococcus aureus, 
virulent  organisms  normally  found  on  the  skin  (Chap.  129).  Although 
cellulitis tends to be circumscribed in normal hosts, it may spread rapidly 
in neutropenic patients. A tiny break in the skin may lead to spreading cel-
lulitis, which is characterized by pain and erythema; in the affected patients, 
signs  of  infection  (e.g.,  purulence)  are  often  lacking.  What  might  be  a 
furuncle in a normal host may require amputation because of uncontrolled 
infection in a patient presenting with leukemia. A dramatic response to an 
infection that might be trivial in a normal host can mark the first sign of 
leukemia. Fortunately, granulocytopenic patients are likely to be infected 
with  certain  types  of  organisms  (Table  74-4);  thus,  the  selection  of  an 
antibiotic regimen is somewhat easier than it might otherwise be (see “Anti-
bacterial Therapy,” below). It is essential to recognize cellulitis early and to 
treat it aggressively. Patients who are neutropenic or who have previously

received antibiotics for other reasons may develop cellulitis with unusual 
organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or fungi). Early treatment, 
even of innocent-looking lesions, is essential to prevent necrosis and loss of 
tissue. Debridement to prevent spread may sometimes be necessary early 
in the course of disease, but it can often be performed after chemotherapy, 
when the PMN count increases.

Sweet  syndrome,  or  febrile  neutrophilic  dermatosis,  was  originally 
described in women with elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts. The 
disease is characterized by the presence of leukocytes in the lower dermis, 
with edema of the papillary body. Ironically, this disease now is usually 
seen in neutropenic patients with cancer, most often in association with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but also in association with a variety of 
other malignancies. Sweet syndrome usually presents as red or bluish-red 
papules or nodules that may coalesce and form sharply bordered plaques 
(see Fig. A1-40). The edema may suggest vesicles, but on palpation, the 
lesions  are  solid,  and  vesicles  probably  never  arise  in  this  disease.  The 
lesions are most common on the face, neck, and arms. On the legs, they 
may be confused with erythema nodosum (see Fig. A1-39). The devel-
opment  of  lesions  is  often  accompanied  by  high  fevers  and  an  elevated 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Both the lesions and the temperature ele-
vation respond dramatically to glucocorticoid administration. Treatment 
begins with high doses of glucocorticoids (prednisone, 60 mg/d) followed 
by tapered doses over the next 2–3 weeks.

Data  indicate  that  erythema  multiforme  (see  Fig.  A1-24)  with 
mucous membrane involvement is often associated with herpes simplex 
virus (HSV) infection and is distinct from Stevens-Johnson syndrome, 
which is associated with drugs and tends to have a more widespread 
distribution.  Because  cancer  patients  are  both  immunosuppressed 
(and  therefore  susceptible  to  herpes  infections)  and  heavily  treated 
with  drugs  (and  therefore  subject  to  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  [see 
Fig. A3-4]), both of these conditions are common in this population.

Cytokines,  which  are  used  as  adjuvants  or  primary  treatments  for 
cancer,  can  themselves  cause  characteristic  rashes,  further  compli-
cating  the  differential  diagnosis.  This  phenomenon  is  a  particular 
problem in bone marrow (stem cell) transplant recipients (Chap. 143), 
who, in addition to having the usual chemotherapy-, antibiotic-, and 
cytokine-induced rashes, are plagued by graft-versus-host disease.
 ■ CATHETER-RELATED INFECTIONS
Because intravenous (IV) catheters are commonly used in cancer che-
motherapy  and  are  prone  to  cause  infection  (Chap.  142),  they  pose 
a  major  problem  in  the  care  of  patients  with  cancer.  Some  catheter- 
associated  infections  can  be  treated  with  antibiotics,  whereas  in  oth-
ers,  the  catheter  must  be  removed  (Table  74-5).  If  the  patient  has  a 
“tunneled” catheter (which consists of an entrance site, a subcutaneous 

559

tunnel, and an exit site), a red streak over the subcutaneous part of the 
line (the tunnel) is grounds for immediate device removal. Failure to 
remove  catheters  under  these  circumstances  may  result  in  extensive 
cellulitis and tissue necrosis.

More common than tunnel infections are exit-site infections, often 
with  erythema  around  the  area  where  the  line  penetrates  the  skin. 
Most  authorities  (Chap.  147)  recommend  treatment  (usually  with 
vancomycin)  for  an  exit-site  infection  caused  by  coagulase-negative 
Staphylococcus.  Treatment  of  coagulase-positive  staphylococcal  infec-
tion is associated with a poorer outcome, and it is advisable to remove 
the  catheter  if  possible.  Similarly,  most  clinicians  remove  catheters 
associated  with  infections  due  to  P.  aeruginosa  and  Candida  species, 
because such infections are difficult to treat and bloodstream infections 
with these organisms are likely to be deadly. Catheter infections caused 
by  Burkholderia  cepacia,  Stenotrophomonas  species,  Agrobacterium 
species,  Acinetobacter  baumannii,  Pseudomonas  species  other  than 
aeruginosa,  and  carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae  are  likely 
to be very difficult to eradicate with antibiotics alone. Similarly, isola-
tion of Bacillus, Corynebacterium, and Mycobacterium species should 
prompt removal of the catheter.

 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT–SPECIFIC 
SYNDROMES
Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Disease 
INFECTIONS OF THE 
MOUTH  The  oral  cavity  is  rich  in  aerobic  and  anaerobic  bacteria 
(Chap. 177) that normally live in a commensal relationship with the 
host.  The  antimetabolic  effects  of  chemotherapy  cause  a  breakdown 
of mucosal host defenses, leading to ulceration of the mouth and the 
potential  for  invasion  by  resident  bacteria.  Mouth  ulcerations  afflict 
most  patients  receiving  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  and  have  been  asso-
ciated  with  viridans  streptococcal  bacteremia.  Candida  infections  of 
the  mouth  are  very  common.  Fluconazole  is  clearly  effective  in  the 
treatment  of  both  local  infections  (thrush)  and  systemic  infections 
(esophagitis) due to Candida albicans. Other azoles (e.g., voriconazole) 
as well as echinocandins offer similar efficacy as well as activity against 
the  fluconazole-resistant  organisms  that  are  associated  with  chronic 
fluconazole treatment (Chap. 216).

Noma (cancrum oris), commonly seen in malnourished children, is 
a penetrating disease of the soft and hard tissues of the mouth and adja-
cent sites, with resulting necrosis and gangrene. It has a counterpart in 
immunocompromised patients and is thought to be due to invasion of 
the tissues by Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and other normal inhabitants 
of the mouth. Noma is associated with debility, poor oral hygiene, and 
immunosuppression.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci are most common.

Failure to remove the catheter may lead to necrosis of the 
involved area requiring skin grafts in the future.

Usually, start with vancomycin. 
Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and 
daptomycin are alternative agents.

If there are no contraindications to line removal, this course of 
action is optimal. If the line is removed, antibiotics may not be 
necessary.

Treat with antibiotics to which the 
organism is sensitive, with duration 
based on the clinical setting.

The incidence of metastatic infections following S. aureus 
infection and the difficulty of treating enterococcal infection 
make line removal the recommended course of action. In 
addition, gram-positive rods do not respond readily to antibiotics 
alone.

Organisms like Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, and 
Burkholderia are notoriously hard to treat, as are carbapenem-
resistant organisms.
Fungal infections of catheters are extremely difficult to treat.

Recommended

Use an agent to which the organism is 
shown to be sensitive.

Viruses,  particularly  HSV,  are  a  prominent  cause  of  morbidity  in 
immunocompromised  patients,  in  whom  they  are  associated  with 
severe mucositis. The use of acyclovir, either prophylactically or ther-
apeutically, is of value.
ESOPHAGEAL  INFECTIONS  The  differential  diagnosis  of  esophagitis 
(usually presenting as substernal chest pain upon swallowing) includes 
herpes simplex and candidiasis, both of which are readily treatable.
Lower  Gastrointestinal  Tract  Disease  Hepatic  candidiasis 
(Chap. 216) results from seeding of the liver (usually from a gastro-
intestinal source) in neutropenic patients. It is most common among 
patients being treated for AML and usually presents symptomatically 
around the time neutropenia resolves. The characteristic picture is that 
of persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics, abdominal pain and ten-
derness or nausea, and elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase 
in a patient with hematologic malignancy who has recently recovered 
from  neutropenia.  The  diagnosis  of  this  disease  (which  may  present 
in an indolent manner and persist for several months) is based on the 
finding of yeasts or pseudohyphae in granulomatous lesions. Hepatic 
ultrasound or CT may reveal bull’s-eye lesions. MRI scans reveal small 
lesions not visible by other imaging modalities. The pathology (a gran-
ulomatous  response)  and  the  timing  (with  resolution  of  neutropenia 
and an elevation in granulocyte count) suggest that the host response 
to Candida is an important component of the manifestations of disease. 
In  many  cases,  although  organisms  are  visible,  cultures  of  biopsied 
material may be negative. The designation hepatosplenic candidiasis or 
hepatic  candidiasis  is  a  misnomer  because  the  disease  often  involves 
the kidneys and other tissues; the term chronic disseminated candidiasis 
may  be  more  appropriate.  Because  of  the  risk  of  bleeding  with  liver 
biopsy, diagnosis is often based on imaging studies (MRI, CT). Treat-
ment should be directed to the causative agent (usually C. albicans but 
sometimes Candida tropicalis or other less common Candida species).

Typhlitis  Typhlitis  (also  referred  to  as  necrotizing  colitis,  neutro-
penic colitis, necrotizing enteropathy, ileocecal syndrome, and cecitis) 
is a clinical syndrome of fever and right-lower-quadrant (or generalized 
abdominal) tenderness in an immunosuppressed host. This syndrome 
is  classically  seen  in  neutropenic  patients  after  chemotherapy  with 
cytotoxic drugs. It may be more common among children than among 
adults  and  appears  to  be  much  more  common  among  patients  with 
AML  or  ALL  than  among  those  with  other  types  of  cancer.  Physical 
examination reveals right-lower-quadrant tenderness, with or without 
rebound  tenderness.  Associated  diarrhea  (often  bloody)  is  common, 
and the diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of a thickened cecal 
wall on CT, MRI, or ultrasonography. Plain films may reveal a right-
lower-quadrant  mass,  but  CT  with  contrast  or  MRI  is  a  much  more 
sensitive means of diagnosis. Although surgery is sometimes attempted 
to  avoid  perforation  from  ischemia,  most  cases  resolve  with  medical 
therapy alone. The disease is sometimes associated with positive blood 
cultures (which usually yield aerobic gram-negative bacilli), and ther-
apy  is  recommended  for  a  broad  spectrum  of  bacteria  (particularly 
gram-negative bacilli, which are likely to be found in the bowel flora).
Clostridioides  difficile–Induced  Diarrhea  Patients  with  cancer 
are predisposed to the development of C. difficile diarrhea (Chap. 134) 
as a consequence of chemotherapy alone. Thus, they may test positive 
for  C.  difficile  even  without  receiving  antibiotics.  Obviously,  such 
patients are also subject to C. difficile–induced diarrhea as a result of 
antibiotic pressure. C. difficile should always be considered as a possible 
cause of diarrhea in cancer patients who have received either chemo-
therapy  or  antibiotics.  New  approaches  to  treat  C.  difficile–induced 
diarrhea and to prevent C. difficile expansion as part of the gut micro-
biota may make this disease less troublesome in the future.

 ■ CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM–SPECIFIC 
SYNDROMES
Meningitis  The  presentation  of  meningitis  in  patients  with  lym-
phoma  or  CLL  and  in  patients  receiving  chemotherapy  (particu-
larly  with  glucocorticoids)  for  solid  tumors  suggests  a  diagnosis  of 

cryptococcal or listerial infection. As noted previously, splenectomized 
patients are susceptible to rapid, overwhelming infection with encapsu-
lated bacteria (including S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. menin-
gitidis). Similarly, patients who are antibody-deficient (e.g., those with 
CLL, those who have received intensive chemotherapy, or those who 
have  undergone  bone  marrow  [stem  cell]  transplantation)  are  likely 
to  have  infections  caused  by  these  bacteria.  Other  cancer  patients, 
however, because of their defective cellular immunity, are likely to be 
infected  with  other  pathogens  (Table  74-3).  Central  nervous  system 
(CNS) tuberculosis should be considered, especially in patients from 
countries where tuberculosis is highly prevalent in the population.

Encephalitis  The spectrum of disease resulting from viral enceph-
alitis is expanded in immunocompromised patients. A predisposition 
to infections with intracellular organisms similar to those encountered 
in patients with AIDS (Chap. 202) is seen in cancer patients receiving 
(1)  high-dose  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  (2)  chemotherapy  affecting 
T-cell  function  (e.g.,  fludarabine),  or  (3)  antibodies  that  eliminate  T 
cells  (e.g.,  anti-CD3,  alemtuzumab,  anti-CD52)  or  cytokine  activity 
(anti–tumor  necrosis  factor  agents  or  interleukin  1  receptor  antago-
nists).  Infection  with  varicella-zoster  virus  (VZV)  has  been  associ-
ated  with  encephalitis  that  may  be  caused  by  VZV-related  vasculitis. 
Chronic  viral  infections  may  also  be  associated  with  dementia  and 
encephalitic  presentations.  A  diagnosis  of  progressive  multifocal  leu-
koencephalopathy  (Chap.  138)  should  be  considered  when  a  patient 
who has received chemotherapy (rituximab in particular) presents with 
dementia (Table 74-6). Other abnormalities of the CNS that may be 
confused  with  infection  include  normal-pressure  hydrocephalus  and 
vasculitis resulting from CNS irradiation. It may be possible to differ-
entiate these conditions by MRI.

Brain  Masses  Mass  lesions  of  the  brain  most  often  present  as 
headache with or without fever or neurologic abnormalities. Infections 
associated  with  mass  lesions  may  be  caused  by  bacteria  (particularly 
Nocardia), fungi (particularly Cryptococcus or Aspergillus), or parasites 
(Toxoplasma).  Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV)–associated  lymphoma  may 
also  present  as  single—or  sometimes  multiple—mass  lesions  of  the 
brain. A biopsy may be required for a definitive diagnosis.

 ■ PULMONARY INFECTIONS
Pneumonia (Chap. 126) in immunocompromised patients may be dif-
ficult to diagnose because conventional methods of diagnosis depend 
on  the  presence  of  neutrophils.  Bacterial  pneumonia  in  neutropenic 
patients  may  present  without  purulent  sputum—or,  in  fact,  without 
any sputum at all—and may not produce physical findings suggestive 
of chest consolidation (rales or egophony).

In  granulocytopenic  patients  with  persistent  or  recurrent  fever,  the 
chest x-ray pattern may help to localize an infection and thus to deter-
mine  which  investigative  tests  and  procedures  should  be  undertaken 
and  which  therapeutic  options  should  be  considered  (Table  74-7).  In 
this setting, a simple chest x-ray is a screening tool; because the impaired 
host  response  results  in  less  evidence  of  consolidation  or  infiltration, 
high-resolution  CT  is  recommended  for  the  diagnosis  of  pulmonary 
infections. The difficulties encountered in the management of pulmo-
nary infiltrates relate in part to the difficulties of performing diagnostic

procedures  on  the  patients  involved.  When  platelet  counts  can  be 
increased to adequate levels by transfusion, microscopic and microbi-
ologic evaluation of the fluid obtained by endoscopic bronchial lavage 
is  often  diagnostic.  Lavage  fluid  should  be  cultured  for  Mycoplasma, 
Chlamydia,  Legionella,  Nocardia,  more  common  bacterial  pathogens, 
fungi, and viruses. In addition, the possibility of Pneumocystis pneumo-
nia should be considered, especially in patients with ALL or lymphoma 
who  have  not  received  prophylactic  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(TMP-SMX).  The  characteristics  of  the  infiltrate  may  be  helpful  in 
decisions about further diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers. Nodular 
infiltrates suggest fungal pneumonia (e.g., that caused by Aspergillus or 
Mucor). Such lesions may best be approached by visualized biopsy pro-
cedures. It is worth noting that while bacterial pneumonias classically 
present  as  lobar  infiltrates  in  normal  hosts,  bacterial  pneumonias  in 
granulocytopenic  hosts  present  with  a  paucity  of  signs,  symptoms,  or 
radiographic abnormalities; thus, the diagnosis is difficult.

Aspergillus species (Chap. 217) can colonize the skin and respiratory 
tract  or  cause  fatal  systemic  illness.  Although  this  fungus  may  cause 
aspergillomas  in  a  previously  existing  cavity  or  may  produce  allergic 
bronchopulmonary disease in some patients, the major problem posed 
by this genus in neutropenic patients is invasive disease, primarily due 
to Aspergillus fumigatus or Aspergillus flavus. The organisms enter the 
host  following  colonization  of  the  respiratory  tract,  with  subsequent 
invasion of blood vessels. The disease is likely to present as a throm-
botic  or  embolic  event  because  of  this  ability  of  the  fungi  to  invade 
blood vessels. The risk of infection with Aspergillus correlates directly 
with the duration of neutropenia. In prolonged neutropenia, positive 
surveillance cultures for nasopharyngeal colonization with Aspergillus 
may predict the development of disease.

Patients with Aspergillus infection often present with pleuritic chest 
pain and fever, which are sometimes accompanied by cough. Hemop-
tysis may be an ominous sign. Chest x-rays may reveal new focal infil-
trates or nodules. Chest CT may reveal a characteristic halo consisting 
of a mass-like infiltrate surrounded by an area of low attenuation. The 
presence of a “crescent sign” on chest x-ray or chest CT, in which the 
mass progresses to central cavitation, is characteristic of invasive Asper-
gillus infection but may develop as the lesions are resolving.

In  addition  to  causing  pulmonary  disease,  Aspergillus  may  invade 
through the nose or palate, with deep sinus penetration. The appearance 
of a discolored area in the nasal passages or on the hard palate should 
prompt a search for invasive Aspergillus. This situation is likely to require 
surgical  debridement.  Catheter  infections  with  Aspergillus  usually 
require  both  removal  of  the  catheter  and  antifungal  therapy.  Antifun-
gal prophylaxis has led to the emergence of non-fumigatus Aspergillus 
species  as  well  as  Mucorales  and  Scedosporium/Lomentospora  spp.  
(Chaps. 217–219).

Diffuse interstitial infiltrates suggest viral, parasitic, or Pneumocys-
tis pneumonia. If the patient has a diffuse interstitial pattern on chest 
x-ray, it may be reasonable, while considering invasive diagnostic pro-
cedures, to institute empirical treatment for Pneumocystis with TMP-
SMX and for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella with a quinolone 
or azithromycin. Noninvasive procedures, such as staining of induced 
sputum smears for Pneumocystis, serum cryptococcal antigen tests, and 
urine testing for Legionella antigen, may be helpful. Serum galactoman-
nan  and  β-d-glucan  tests  may  be  of  value  in  diagnosing  Aspergillus 

infection,  but  their  utility  is  limited  by  their  lack  of  sensitivity  and 
specificity.  The  presence  of  an  elevated  level  of  β-d-glucan  in  the 
serum of a patient being treated for cancer who is not receiving pro-
phylaxis against Pneumocystis suggests the diagnosis of Pneumocystis 
pneumonia. Infections with viruses that cause only upper respiratory 
symptoms  in  immunocompetent  hosts,  such  as  respiratory  syncytial 
virus  (RSV),  influenza  viruses,  and  parainfluenza  viruses,  may  be 
associated  with  fatal  pneumonitis  in  immunocompromised  hosts. 
CMV  reactivation  occurs  in  cancer  patients  receiving  chemotherapy, 
but CMV pneumonia is most common among hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) recipients (Chap. 143). Polymerase chain reaction 
testing now allows rapid diagnosis of viral pneumonia, which can lead 
to treatment in some cases (e.g., influenza). Multiplex studies that can 
detect a wide array of viruses in the lung and upper respiratory tract are 
now available and will lead to specific diagnoses of viral pneumonias.

Bleomycin  is  the  most  common  cause  of  chemotherapy-induced 
lung  disease.  Other  causes  include  alkylating  agents  (such  as  cyclo-
phosphamide,  chlorambucil,  and  melphalan),  nitrosoureas  (carmus-
tine  [BCNU],  lomustine  [CCNU],  and  methyl-CCNU),  busulfan, 
procarbazine,  methotrexate,  and  hydroxyurea.  Both  infectious  and 
noninfectious  (drug-  and/or  radiation-induced)  pneumonitis  can 
cause fever and abnormalities on chest x-ray; thus, the differential diag-
nosis of an infiltrate in a patient receiving chemotherapy encompasses 
a broad range of conditions (Table 74-7). The treatment of radiation 
pneumonitis (which may respond dramatically to glucocorticoids) or 
drug-induced  pneumonitis  is  different  from  that  of  infectious  pneu-
monia, and a biopsy may be important in the diagnosis. Unfortunately, 
no  definitive  diagnosis  can  be  made  in  ~30%  of  cases,  even  after 
bronchoscopy.

Open-lung  biopsy  is  the  gold  standard  of  diagnostic  techniques. 
Biopsy via a visualized thoracostomy can replace an open procedure in 
many cases. When a biopsy cannot be performed, empirical treatment 
can be undertaken; a quinolone or an erythromycin derivative (azith-
romycin) and TMP-SMX are used in the case of diffuse infiltrates, and 
an antifungal agent is administered in the case of nodular infiltrates. 
The risks should be weighed carefully in these cases. If inappropriate 
drugs are administered, empirical treatment may prove toxic or inef-
fective; either of these outcomes may be riskier than biopsy.

 ■ CARDIOVASCULAR INFECTIONS
Patients  with  Hodgkin’s  disease  are  prone  to  persistent  infections  by 
Salmonella,  sometimes  (and  particularly  often  in  elderly  patients) 
affecting a vascular site. The use of IV catheters deliberately lodged in 
the right atrium is associated with a high incidence of bacterial endo-
carditis, presumably related to valve damage followed by bacteremia. 
Nonbacterial  thrombotic  endocarditis  (marantic  endocarditis)  has 
been  described  in  association  with  a  variety  of  malignancies  (most 
often  solid  tumors)  and  may  follow  bone  marrow  (stem  cell)  trans-
plantation  as  well.  The  presentation  of  an  embolic  event  with  a  new 
cardiac  murmur  suggests  this  diagnosis.  Blood  cultures  are  negative 
in this disease of unknown pathogenesis. Infective endocarditis can be 
a complication of cancer treatment because of the use of IV catheters 
that lead to bacterial infection. In addition, patients may present with 
infective endocarditis as an initial presentation of cancer, particularly 
in the case of gastrointestinal or genitourinary sources.

 ■ ENDOCRINE SYNDROMES
Infections  of  the  endocrine  system  have  been  described  in  immu-
nocompromised  patients.  Candida  infection  of  the  thyroid  may  be 
difficult to diagnose during the neutropenic period. It can be defined 
by indium-labeled WBC scans or gallium scans after neutrophil counts 
increase. CMV infection can cause adrenalitis with or without resulting 
adrenal insufficiency. The presentation of a sudden endocrine anomaly 
in an immunocompromised patient can be a sign of infection in the 
involved end organ.

 ■ MUSCULOSKELETAL INFECTIONS
Infection  that  is  a  consequence  of  vascular  compromise,  resulting 
in  gangrene,  can  occur  when  a  tumor  restricts  the  blood  supply  to 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   561

21/01/22   3:48 PM

 
 
 
 
 
 
562 muscles,  bones,  or  joints.  The  process  of  diagnosis  and  treatment  of 
such  infection  is  similar  to  that  in  normal  hosts,  with  the  following 
caveats:

1.  In  terms  of  diagnosis,  a  lack  of  physical  findings  resulting  from  a 
lack  of  granulocytes  in  the  granulocytopenic  patient  should  make 
the clinician more aggressive in obtaining tissue rather than more 
willing to rely on physical signs.

2.  In terms of therapy, aggressive debridement of infected tissues may 
be  required.  However,  it  is  usually  difficult  to  operate  on  patients 
who have recently received chemotherapy, both because of a lack of 
platelets (which results in bleeding complications) and because of a 
lack of WBCs (which may lead to secondary infection). A blood cul-
ture  positive  for  Clostridium  perfringens—an  organism  commonly 
associated  with  gas  gangrene—can  have  a  number  of  meanings 
(Chap.  154).  Clostridium  septicum  bacteremia  is  associated  with 
the presence of an underlying malignancy. Bloodstream infections 
with intestinal organisms such as Streptococcus bovis biotype 1 and 
C. perfringens may arise spontaneously from lower gastrointestinal 
lesions (tumor or polyps); alternatively, these lesions may be harbin-
gers of invasive disease. The clinical setting must be considered in 
order to define the appropriate treatment for each case.

 ■ RENAL AND URETERAL INFECTIONS
Infections  of  the  urinary  tract  are  common  among  patients  whose 
ureteral excretion is compromised (Table 74-1). Candida, which has a 
predilection for the kidney, can invade either from the bloodstream or 
in a retrograde manner (via the ureters or bladder) in immunocompro-
mised patients. The presence of “fungus balls” or persistent candiduria 
suggests invasive disease. Persistent funguria (with Aspergillus as well as 
Candida) should prompt a search for a nidus of infection in the kidney.
Certain  viruses  are  typically  seen  only  in  immunosuppressed 
patients. BK virus (polyomavirus hominis 1) has been documented in 
the  urine  of  bone  marrow  transplant  recipients  and,  like  adenovirus, 
may be associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.

ABNORMALITIES THAT PREDISPOSE TO 
INFECTION
(Table 74-1)
 ■ THE LYMPHOID SYSTEM
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to detail how all the immunologic 
abnormalities that result from cancer or from chemotherapy for cancer 
lead  to  infections.  Disorders  of  the  immune  system  are  discussed  in 
other sections of this book. As has been noted, patients with antibody 
deficiency  are  predisposed  to  overwhelming  infection  with  encapsu-
lated bacteria (including S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningit-
idis). Infections that result from the lack of a functional cellular immune 
system  are  described  in  Chap.  202.  It  is  worth  mentioning,  however, 
that patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for any form of cancer 
will have not only defects due to granulocytopenia but also lymphocyte 
dysfunction, which may be profound. Thus, these patients—especially 
those  receiving  glucocorticoid-containing  regimens  or  drugs  that 
inhibit  either  T-cell  activation  (calcineurin  inhibitors  or  drugs  like 
fludarabine, which affect lymphocyte function) or cytokine induction—
should be given prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia.

Patients  receiving  treatment  that  eliminates  B  cells  (e.g.,  with 
anti-CD20  antibodies  or  rituximab)  are  especially  vulnerable  to  inter-
current viral infections. The incidence of progressive multifocal leuko-
encephalopathy (caused by JC virus) is elevated among these patients.

 ■ THE HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM
Initial studies in the 1960s revealed a dramatic increase in the incidence 
of infections (fatal and nonfatal) among cancer patients with a granulo-
cyte count of <500/μL. The use of prophylactic antibacterial agents has 
reduced the number of bacterial infections, but 35–78% of febrile neu-
tropenic patients being treated for hematologic malignancies develop 
infections at some time during chemotherapy. Aerobic pathogens (both 

gram-positive  and  gram-negative)  predominate  in  all  series,  but  the 
exact  organisms  isolated  vary  from  center  to  center.  Infections  with 
anaerobic  organisms  are  uncommon.  Geographic  patterns  affect  the 
types of fungi isolated. Tuberculosis and malaria are common causes 
of fever in the developing world and may present in this setting as well.
Neutropenic  patients  are  unusually  susceptible  to  infection  with  a 
wide  variety  of  bacteria;  thus,  antibiotic  therapy  should  be  initiated 
promptly  to  cover  likely  pathogens  if  infection  is  suspected.  Indeed, 
early initiation of antibacterial agents is mandatory to prevent deaths. 
Like  most  immunocompromised  patients,  neutropenic  patients  are 
threatened  by  their  own  microbial  flora,  including  gram-positive  and 
gram-negative  organisms  found  commonly  on  the  skin  and  mucous 
membranes  and  in  the  bowel  (Table  74-4).  Because  treatment  with 
narrow-spectrum agents leads to infection with organisms not covered 
by the antibiotics used, the initial regimen should target all pathogens 
likely to be the initial causes of bacterial infection in neutropenic hosts. 
Studies performed in the 1970s suggested that administration of anti-
microbial agents should be continued until neutropenia resolves—that 
is, the granulocyte count is sustained above 500/μL for at least 2 days. 
Recent  studies  have  indicated  that  it  is  reasonable  to  stop  antibiotics 
in  patients  who  are  afebrile  and  stable  after  72  hours  of  treatment  
(Fig.  74-2).  Fever  may  not  resolve  prior  to  granulocyte  recovery.  In 
some cases, patients remain febrile after resolution of neutropenia. In 
these instances, the risk of sudden death from overwhelming bacteremia 
is greatly reduced, and the following diagnoses should be seriously con-
sidered: (1) fungal infection, (2) bacterial abscesses or undrained foci of 
infection, and (3) drug fever (including reactions to antimicrobial agents 
as  well  as  to  chemotherapy  or  cytokines).  In  the  proper  setting,  viral 
infection or graft-versus-host disease should be considered. In clinical 
practice, antibacterial therapy is usually discontinued when the patient 
is no longer neutropenic and all evidence of bacterial disease has been 
eliminated. Antifungal agents are then discontinued if there is no evi-
dence of fungal disease. If the patient remains febrile, a search for viral 
diseases or unusual pathogens is conducted while unnecessary cytok-
ines and other drugs are systematically eliminated from the regimen.

TREATMENT
Infections in Cancer Patients 

ANTIBACTERIAL THERAPY
Hundreds  of  antibacterial  regimens  have  been  tested  for  use  in 
patients  with  cancer.  The  major  risk  of  infection  is  related  to  the 
degree of neutropenia seen as a consequence of either the disease 
or  the  therapy.  Many  of  the  relevant  studies  have  involved  small 
populations in which the outcomes have generally been good, and 
most have lacked the statistical power to detect differences among 
the  regimens  studied.  Each  febrile  neutropenic  patient  should  be 
approached as a unique problem, with particular attention given to 
previous infections and recent antibiotic exposures. Several general 
guidelines are useful in the initial treatment of neutropenic patients 
with fever (Fig. 74-2):

1.  In the initial regimen, it is necessary to use antibiotics active against 

both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (Table 74-4).

2.  Monotherapy  with  an  aminoglycoside  or  an  antibiotic  lacking 
good activity against gram-positive organisms (e.g., ciprofloxa-
cin or aztreonam) is not adequate in this setting.

3.  The  agents  used  should  reflect  both  the  epidemiology  and  the 

antibiotic resistance pattern of the hospital.

4.  If  the  pattern  of  resistance  justifies  its  use,  a  single  third- 
generation cephalosporin constitutes an appropriate initial regi-
men in many hospitals.

5.  Most standard regimens are designed for patients who have not 
previously received prophylactic antibiotics. The development of 
fever in a patient who has received antibiotics affects the choice 
of subsequent therapy, which should target resistant organisms 
and  organisms  known  to  cause  infections  in  patients  being 
treated with the antibiotics already administered.

6.  Randomized trials have indicated the safety of oral antibiotic reg-
imens in the treatment of “low-risk” patients with fever and neu-
tropenia.  Outpatients  who  are  expected  to  remain  neutropenic 
for <10 days and who do not have concurrent medical problems 
(such  as  hypotension,  pulmonary  compromise,  or  abdominal 
pain)  can  be  classified  as  low  risk  and  treated  with  a  broad- 
spectrum oral regimen.

7.  Several  large-scale  studies  indicate  that  prophylaxis  with  a 
fluoroquinolone  (ciprofloxacin  or  levofloxacin)  decreases  mor-
bidity and mortality rates among afebrile patients who are antic-
ipated to have neutropenia of long duration.

Commonly used antibiotic regimens for the treatment of febrile 
patients  in  whom  prolonged  neutropenia  (>7  days)  is  anticipated 
include  (1)  ceftazidime  or  cefepime,  (2)  piperacillin/tazobactam, 
or (3) imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem. All three regimens have 
shown  equal  efficacy  in  large  trials.  All  three  are  active  against  P. 
aeruginosa  and  a  broad  spectrum  of  aerobic  gram-positive  and 
gram-negative organisms. Imipenem/cilastatin has been associated 
with  an  elevated  rate  of  C.  difficile  diarrhea,  and  many  centers 
reserve  carbapenem  antibiotics  for  treatment  of  gram-negative 
bacteria that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases; these lim-
itations  make  carbapenems  less  attractive  as  an  initial  regimen. 
Despite  the  frequent  involvement  of  coagulase-negative  staphy-
lococci, the initial use of vancomycin or its automatic addition to 
the initial regimen has not resulted in improved outcomes, and the 
antibiotic does exert toxic effects. For these reasons, only judicious 
use  of  vancomycin  is  recommended—for  example,  when  there 
is  good  reason  to  suspect  the  involvement  of  coagulase-negative 
staphylococci (e.g., the appearance of erythema at the exit site of a 
catheter or a positive culture for methicillin-resistant S. aureus or 
coagulase-negative staphylococci). Because the sensitivities of bac-
teria vary from hospital to hospital, clinicians are advised to check 
their local sensitivities and to be aware that resistance patterns can 
change quickly, necessitating a change in the approach to patients 
with  fever  and  neutropenia.  Similarly,  infection  control  services 
should monitor for basic antibiotic resistance and for fungal infec-
tions. The appearance of a large number of Aspergillus infections, in 
particular, suggests the possibility of an environmental source that 
requires further investigation and remediation.

The initial antibacterial regimen should be refined on the basis 
of culture results (Fig. 74-2). Blood cultures are the most relevant 
basis for selection of therapy; surface cultures of skin and mucous 
membranes may be misleading. In the case of gram-positive bacte-
remia  or  another  gram-positive  infection,  it  is  important  that  the 
antibiotic  be  optimal  for  the  organism  isolated.  Once  treatment 
with  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  has  begun,  it  is  not  desirable  to 
discontinue  all  antibiotics  because  of  the  risk  of  failing  to  treat  a 
potentially fatal bacterial infection; the addition of more and more 
antibacterial agents to the regimen is not appropriate unless there 
is a clinical or microbiologic reason to do so. Planned progressive 
therapy  (the  serial,  empirical  addition  of  one  drug  after  another 
without  culture  data)  is  not  efficacious  in  most  settings  and  may 
have  unfortunate  consequences.  Simply  adding  another  antibiotic 
for  fear  that  a  gram-negative  infection  is  present  is  a  dubious 
practice. The synergy exhibited by β-lactams and aminoglycosides 
against certain gram-negative organisms (especially P. aeruginosa) 
provides the rationale for using two antibiotics in this setting, but 
recent analyses suggest that efficacy is not enhanced by the addi-
tion  of  aminoglycosides,  while  toxicity  may  be  increased.  Mere 
“double  coverage,”  with  the  addition  of  a  quinolone  or  another 
antibiotic that is not likely to exhibit synergy, has not been shown 
to be beneficial and may cause additional toxicities and side effects. 
Cephalosporins can cause bone marrow suppression, and vancomy-
cin  is  associated  with  neutropenia  in  some  healthy  individuals. 
Furthermore, the addition of multiple cephalosporins may induce  
β-lactamase  production  by  some  organisms;  cephalosporins  and 
double  β-lactam  combinations  should  probably  be  avoided  alto-
gether in Enterobacter infections. 

ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY
Fungal infections in cancer patients are most often associated with 
neutropenia.  Neutropenic  patients  are  predisposed  to  the  devel-
opment  of  invasive  fungal  infections,  most  commonly  those  due 
to  Candida  and  Aspergillus  species  and  occasionally  those  caused 
by  Mucor,  Rhizopus,  Fusarium,  Trichosporon,  Bipolaris,  and  oth-
ers.  Invasive  candidal  disease  is  usually  caused  by  C.  albicans  or 
C. tropicalis but can be caused by C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. 
glabrata. The worldwide spread of C. auris, a species that is typically 
resistant  to  fluconazole  and  often  resistant  to  amphotericin  B  as

well, has further complicated the management of invasive Candida 
infections (Chap. 216).

For  decades,  it  has  been  common  clinical  practice  to  add 
amphotericin  B  to  antibacterial  regimens  if  a  neutropenic  patient 
remains  febrile  despite  4–7  days  of  treatment  with  antibacterial 
agents. The rationale for this empirical addition is that it is difficult 
to  culture  fungi  before  they  cause  disseminated  disease  and  that 
mortality  rates  from  disseminated  fungal  infections  in  granulocy-
topenic  patients  are  high.  Before  the  introduction  of  newer  azoles 
into  clinical  practice,  amphotericin  B  was  the  mainstay  of  anti-
fungal  therapy.  The  insolubility  of  amphotericin  B  has  resulted  in 
the marketing of several lipid formulations that are less toxic than 
the  amphotericin  B  deoxycholate  complex.  Echinocandins  (e.g., 
caspofungin)  are  useful  in  the  treatment  of  infections  caused  by 
azole-resistant Candida strains as well as in therapy for aspergillosis 
and  have  been  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  liposomal  amphotericin 
B  for  the  empirical  treatment  of  patients  with  prolonged  fever 
and neutropenia. Newer azoles have also been demonstrated to be 
effective  in  this  setting.  Although  fluconazole  is  efficacious  in  the 
treatment of infections due to many Candida species, its use against 
serious  fungal  infections  in  immunocompromised  patients  is  lim-
ited by its narrow spectrum: it has no activity against Aspergillus or 
against several non-albicans Candida species. The broad-spectrum 
azoles (e.g., voriconazole and posaconazole) provide another option 
for  the  treatment  of  Aspergillus  infections  (Chap.  217),  including 
CNS  infection.  Clinicians  should  be  aware  that  the  spectrum  of 
each azole is somewhat different and that no drug can be assumed 
to be efficacious against all fungi. Aspergillus terreus is resistant to 
amphotericin B. Although voriconazole is active against Pseudalle-
scheria boydii, amphotericin B is not; however, voriconazole has no 
activity against Mucor. Posaconazole, which is administered orally, is 
useful as a prophylactic agent in patients with prolonged neutrope-
nia. Studies in progress are assessing the use of these agents in com-
binations. For a full discussion of antifungal therapy, see Chap. 211. 

ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
The  availability  of  a  variety  of  agents  active  against  herpes-group 
viruses, including some new agents with a broader spectrum of activ-
ity, has heightened focus on the treatment of viral infections, which 
pose a major problem in cancer patients. Viral diseases caused by the 
herpes  group  are  prominent.  Serious  (and  sometimes  fatal)  infec-
tions due to HSV and VZV are well documented in patients receiv-
ing chemotherapy. CMV may also cause serious disease, but fatalities 
from CMV infection are more common in hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant  recipients.  The  roles  of  human  herpesvirus  (HHV)-6, 
HHV-7,  and  HHV-8  (Kaposi’s  sarcoma–associated  herpesvirus)  in 
cancer patients are still being defined (Chap. 195). EBV lymphopro-
liferative disease (LPD) can occur in patients receiving chemother-
apy but is much more common among transplant recipients (Chap. 
143).  While  clinical  experience  is  most  extensive  with  acyclovir, 
which can be used therapeutically or prophylactically, a number of 
derivative drugs offer advantages over this agent (Chap. 191).

In  addition  to  the  herpes  group,  several  respiratory  viruses  (espe-
cially  RSV)  may  cause  serious  disease  in  cancer  patients.  Although 
influenza vaccination is recommended (see below), it may be ineffective 
in this patient population. The availability of antiviral drugs with activ-
ity  against  influenza  viruses  gives  the  clinician  additional  options  for 
the prophylaxis and treatment of these patients (Chaps. 191 and 200).
The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  affected  cancer  patients  dispro-
portionately. Early analyses suggest that lung cancer patients in par-
ticular are more vulnerable to serious infection with SARS-CoV-2. 

OTHER THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES
A  variety  of  cytokines,  including  granulocyte  colony-stimulating 
factor  and  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor, 
enhance granulocyte recovery after chemotherapy and consequently 
shorten  the  period  of  maximal  vulnerability  to  fatal  infections. 
Most  authorities  recommend  their  use  only  when  neutropenia  is 
both  severe  and  prolonged,  and  they  should  be  used  only  in  the 

appropriate setting (i.e., when stem cells are likely to be responsive) 
and not as an adjunct to antimicrobial agents. The cytokines them-
selves  may  have  adverse  effects,  including  fever,  hypoxemia,  and 
pleural effusions or serositis in other areas (Chap. 349).

Once  neutropenia  has  resolved,  the  risk  of  infection  decreases 
dramatically.  However,  depending  on  what  drugs  they  receive, 
patients  who  continue  on  chemotherapeutic  protocols  remain  at 
high  risk  for  certain  diseases.  Any  patient  receiving  more  than  a 
maintenance dose of glucocorticoids (e.g., in many treatment regi-
mens for diffuse lymphoma) should also receive prophylactic TMP-
SMX because of the risk of Pneumocystis infection; those with ALL 
should receive such prophylaxis for the duration of chemotherapy.

PREVENTION OF INFECTION IN CANCER 
PATIENTS
 ■ EFFECT OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Outbreaks  of  fatal  Aspergillus  infection  have  been  associated  with 
construction  projects  and  materials  in  several  hospitals.  The  associa-
tion between spore counts and risk of infection suggests the need for 
a  high-efficiency  air-handling  system  in  hospitals  that  care  for  large 
numbers of neutropenic patients. The use of laminar-flow rooms and 
prophylactic  antibiotics  has  decreased  the  number  of  infectious  epi-
sodes in severely neutropenic patients. However, because of the expense 
of such a program and the failure to show that it dramatically affects 
mortality rates, most centers do not routinely use laminar flow to care 
for neutropenic patients. Some centers use “reverse isolation,” in which 
health care providers and visitors to a patient who is neutropenic wear 
gowns and gloves. Since most of the infections these patients develop 
are  due  to  organisms  that  colonize  the  patients’  own  skin  and  bowel, 
the  validity  of  such  schemes  is  dubious,  and  limited  clinical  data  do 
not support their use. Hand washing by all staff caring for neutropenic 
patients should be required to prevent the spread of resistant organisms.
The presence of large numbers of bacteria (particularly P. aeruginosa) 
in certain foods, especially fresh vegetables, has led some authorities to 
recommend a special “low-bacteria” diet. A diet consisting of cooked 
and canned food is satisfactory to most neutropenic patients and does 
not involve elaborate disinfection or sterilization protocols. However, 
there  are  no  studies  to  support  even  this  type  of  dietary  restriction. 
Counseling  of  patients  to  avoid  leftovers,  deli  foods,  undercooked 
meat, and unpasteurized dairy products is recommended since these 
foods have been associated with outbreaks of listerial infection.

 ■ PHYSICAL MEASURES
Although  few  studies  address  this  issue,  patients  with  cancer  are  pre-
disposed  to  infections  resulting  from  anatomic  compromise  (e.g., 
lymphedema resulting from node dissections after radical mastectomy). 
Surgeons who specialize in cancer surgery can provide specific guidelines 
for the care of such patients, and patients benefit from common-sense 
advice about how to prevent infections in vulnerable areas.
 ■ IMMUNOGLOBULIN REPLACEMENT
Many patients with multiple myeloma or CLL have immunoglobulin 
deficiencies as a result of their disease, and all allogeneic bone marrow 
transplant  recipients  are  hypogammaglobulinemic  for  a  period  after 
transplantation.  However,  current  recommendations  reserve  intrave-
nous  immunoglobulin  replacement  therapy  for  patients  with  severe, 
prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia (<400 mg of total IgG/dL) and a 
history of repeated infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown 
to be cheaper and is efficacious in preventing infections in most CLL 
patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Routine use of immunoglobu-
lin replacement is not recommended.
 ■ SEXUAL PRACTICES
The  use  of  condoms  is  recommended  for  severely  immunocompro-
mised  patients.  Any  sexual  practice  that  results  in  oral  exposure  to 
feces is not recommended. Neutropenic patients should be advised to 
avoid any practice that results in trauma, as even microscopic cuts may 
result in bacterial invasion and fatal sepsis.

 ■ ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS
Several studies indicate that the use of oral fluoroquinolones prevents 
infection  and  decreases  mortality  rates  among  severely  neutropenic 
patients. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis is mandatory for patients with 
ALL  and  for  all  cancer  patients  receiving  glucocorticoid-containing 
chemotherapy regimens.
 ■ VACCINATION OF CANCER PATIENTS
In  general,  patients  undergoing  chemotherapy  respond  less  well  to 
vaccines  than  do  normal  hosts.  Their  greater  need  for  vaccines  thus 
leads  to  a  dilemma  in  their  management.  Purified  proteins  and  inac-
tivated vaccines are almost never contraindicated and should be given 
to  patients  even  during  chemotherapy.  For  example,  all  adults  should 
receive diphtheria–tetanus toxoid boosters at the indicated times as well 
as seasonal influenza vaccine. However, if possible, vaccination should 
not be undertaken concurrent with cytotoxic chemotherapy. If patients 
are expected to be receiving chemotherapy for several months and vac-
cination is indicated (e.g., influenza vaccination in the fall), the vaccine 
should  be  given  midcycle—as  far  apart  in  time  as  possible  from  the 
antimetabolic agents that will prevent an immune response. The menin-
gococcal and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines should be given to 
patients before splenectomy, if possible. The H. influenzae type b con-
jugate vaccine should be administered to all splenectomized patients.

In  general,  live  virus  (or  live  bacterial)  vaccines  should  not  be 
given to patients during intensive chemotherapy because of the risk of 
disseminated infection. Recommendations on vaccination are summa-
rized  in  Table  74-2  (see  https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/index.html 
for updated recommendations).

Dr.  Robert  W.  Finberg,  Richard  M.  Haidack  Distinguished  Professor 
and  Chair  of  Medicine,  University  of  Massachusetts  Chan  Medical 
School  (2000-2020),  Professor  of  Medicine  and  Chair  of  Infectious 
Diseases,  Dana  Farber  Cancer  Institute  (1996-1999),  passed  away  on 
August 30, 2021. In addition to this chapter, he authored Chapter 143, 
“Infections in Transplant Recipients.” Dr. Finberg was an internation-
ally renowned physician-scientist and an academic leader whose career 
spanned four decades. A brilliant talented researcher focused on viral 
pathogenesis he was also a consummate clinician who attended at the 
bedside  throughout  his  career.  Dr.  Finberg  played  an  important  role 
in the COVID-19 pandemic by leading clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 
vaccines  and  therapeutics.  Warm  and  generous  with  a  keen  wit,  he 
was a beloved family man, colleague and friend. As an educator and 
mentor he truly cared about training the next generation, as evidenced 
by the legacy of a very large number of trainees he leaves behind. We 
are indebted to Dr. Finberg for his outstanding contributions to nine 
editions of Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine and to his con-
siderable and significant contributions to the field of human health.

75 Oncologic Emergencies

Rasim Gucalp, Janice P. Dutcher

Emergencies in patients with cancer may be classified into three groups: 
pressure or obstruction caused by a space-occupying lesion, metabolic 
or  hormonal  problems  (paraneoplastic  syndromes,  Chap.  93),  and 
treatment-related complications.

STRUCTURAL-OBSTRUCTIVE ONCOLOGIC 
EMERGENCIES
 ■ SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME
Superior  vena  cava  syndrome  (SVCS)  is  the  clinical  manifestation  of 
superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, with severe reduction in venous 
return from the head, neck, and upper extremities. Malignant tumors, 
such as lung cancer, lymphoma, and metastatic tumors, are responsible 
for the majority of SVCS cases. With the expanding use of intravascular 
devices  (e.g.,  permanent  central  venous  access  catheters,  pacemaker/
defibrillator  leads),  the  prevalence  of  benign  causes  of  SVCS  is  now 
increasing, accounting for at least 40% of cases. Lung cancer, particularly 
of  small-cell  and  squamous  cell  histologies,  accounts  for  ~85%  of  all 
cases  of  malignant  origin.  In  young  adults,  malignant  lymphoma  is  a 
leading cause of SVCS. Hodgkin’s lymphoma involves the mediastinum 
more commonly than other lymphomas but rarely causes SVCS. When 
SVCS is noted in a young man with a mediastinal mass, the differential 
diagnosis  is  lymphoma  versus  primary  mediastinal  germ  cell  tumor. 
Metastatic cancers to the mediastinal lymph nodes, such as testicular and 
breast carcinomas, account for a small proportion of cases. Other causes 
include benign tumors, aortic aneurysm, thyromegaly, thrombosis, and 
fibrosing mediastinitis from prior irradiation, histoplasmosis, or Behçet’s 
syndrome. SVCS as the initial manifestation of Behçet’s syndrome may 
be due to inflammation of the SVC associated with thrombosis.

Patients  with  SVCS  usually  present  with  neck  and  facial  swelling 
(especially  around  the  eyes),  dyspnea,  and  cough.  Other  symptoms 
include  hoarseness,  tongue  swelling,  headaches,  nasal  congestion, 
epistaxis,  hemoptysis,  dysphagia,  pain,  dizziness,  syncope,  and  leth-
argy.  Bending  forward  or  lying  down  may  aggravate  the  symptoms. 
The characteristic physical findings are dilated neck veins; an increased 
number  of  collateral  veins  covering  the  anterior  chest  wall;  cyanosis; 
and  edema  of  the  face,  arms,  and  chest.  Facial  swelling  and  plethora 
are typically exacerbated when the patient is supine. More severe cases 
include proptosis, glossal and laryngeal edema, and obtundation. The 
clinical picture is milder if the obstruction is located above the azygos 
vein. Symptoms are usually progressive, but in some cases, they may 
improve as collateral circulation develops.

Signs  and  symptoms  of  cerebral  and/or  laryngeal  edema,  though 
rare, are associated with a poorer prognosis and require urgent eval-
uation.  Seizures  are  more  likely  related  to  brain  metastases  than  to 
cerebral  edema  from  venous  occlusion.  Patients  with  small-cell  lung 
cancer  and  SVCS  have  a  higher  incidence  of  brain  metastases  than 
those without SVCS.

Cardiorespiratory  symptoms  at  rest,  particularly  with  positional 
changes,  suggest  significant  airway  and  vascular  obstruction  and 
limited  physiologic  reserve.  Cardiac  arrest  or  respiratory  failure  can 
occur, particularly in patients receiving sedatives or undergoing gen-
eral anesthesia.

Rarely,  esophageal  varices  may  develop,  particularly  in  the  setting 
of SVC syndrome due to hemodialysis catheter. These are “downhill” 
varices based on the direction of blood flow from cephalad to caudad 
(in contrast to “uphill” varices associated with caudad to cephalad flow 
from portal hypertension). If the obstruction to the SVC is proximal to 
the azygous vein, varices develop in the upper one-third of the esoph-
agus. If the obstruction involves or is distal to the azygous vein, varices 
occur in the entire length of the esophagus. Variceal bleeding may be a 
late complication of chronic SVCS.

SVC  obstruction  may  lead  to  bilateral  breast  edema  with  bilateral 
enlarged  breasts.  Unilateral  breast  dilation  may  be  seen  as  a  conse-
quence of axillary or subclavian vein blockage.

The diagnosis of SVCS is a clinical one. The most significant chest 
radiographic  finding  is  widening  of  the  superior  mediastinum,  most 
commonly  on  the  right  side.  Pleural  effusion  occurs  in  only  25%  of 
patients,  often  on  the  right  side.  The  majority  of  these  effusions  are 
exudative  and  occasionally  chylous.  However,  a  normal  chest  radio-
graph  is  still  compatible  with  the  diagnosis  if  other  characteristic 
findings  are  present.  Computed  tomography  (CT)  provides  the  most 
reliable  view  of  the  mediastinal  anatomy.  The  diagnosis  of  SVCS 
requires  diminished  or  absent  opacification  of  central  venous  struc-
tures with prominent collateral venous circulation. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used to diagnose SVC obstruction 
with a 100% sensitivity and specificity, but dyspneic SVCS patients may 
have difficulty remaining supine for the entire imaging process. Inva-
sive procedures, including bronchoscopy, percutaneous needle biopsy, 
mediastinoscopy, and even thoracotomy, can be performed by a skilled 
clinician without any major risk of bleeding. Endobronchial or esoph-
ageal ultrasound-guided needle aspiration may establish the diagnosis 
safely. For patients with a known cancer, a detailed workup usually is 
not necessary, and appropriate treatment may be started after obtaining 
a  CT  scan  of  the  thorax.  For  those  with  no  history  of  malignancy,  a 
detailed evaluation is essential to rule out benign causes and determine 
a specific diagnosis to direct the appropriate therapy.

TREATMENT
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome

The  one  potentially  life-threatening  complication  of  a  superior 
mediastinal mass is tracheal obstruction. Upper airway obstruction 
demands  emergent  therapy.  Diuretics  with  a  low-salt  diet,  head 
elevation, and oxygen may produce temporary symptomatic relief. 
Glucocorticoids have a limited role except in the setting of medias-
tinal lymphoma masses.

Radiation therapy is the primary treatment for SVCS caused by 
non-small-cell lung cancer and other metastatic solid tumors. Che-
motherapy is effective when the underlying cancer is small-cell car-
cinoma of the lung, lymphoma, or germ cell tumor. SVCS recurs in 
10–30% of patients; it may be palliated with the use of intravascular 
self-expanding stents (Fig. 75-1). Endovascular therapy is more fre-
quently used first, to provide rapid relief of clinical symptoms with 
reduced complications. Early stenting may be necessary in patients 
with  severe  symptoms;  however,  the  prompt  increase  in  venous 
return  after  stenting  may  precipitate  heart  failure  and  pulmonary 
edema. Other complications of stent placement include hematoma 
at the insertion site, SVC perforation, stent migration in the right 
ventricle, stent fracture, and pulmonary embolism.

Clinical  improvement  occurs  in  most  patients,  although  this 
improvement may be due to the development of adequate collateral 
circulation. The mortality associated with SVCS does not relate to 
caval obstruction but rather to the underlying cause. 
SVCS AND CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS IN ADULTS
The use of long-term central venous catheters has become common 
practice in patients with cancer. Major vessel thrombosis may occur. 
In these cases, catheter removal should be combined with antico-
agulation to prevent embolization. SVCS in this setting, if detected 
early, can be treated by fibrinolytic therapy without sacrificing the 
catheter.  When  managing  patients  with  transvenous  lead-related 
SVC  syndrome,  anticoagulation,  local  and  systemic  thrombolytic 
therapy, and surgical intervention can be effective therapy in select 
patients. Endovascular stenting has also been shown to be safe and 
promising, with minimal procedural or clinical complications. The 
role of anticoagulation after SVC stent placement is controversial.

 ■ PERICARDIAL EFFUSION/TAMPONADE
Malignant pericardial disease is found at autopsy in 5–10% of patients 
with cancer, most frequently with lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemias,

extrathoracic malignancy is rare. The origin is not malignancy in ~50% 
of cancer patients with symptomatic pericardial disease, but it can be 
related to irradiation; drug-induced pericarditis, including chemother-
apeutic agents such as all-trans retinoic acid, arsenic trioxide, imatinib, 
and  other  abl  kinase  inhibitors;  hypothyroidism;  idiopathic  pericar-
ditis; infection; or autoimmune diseases. Pericardial disease has been 
associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors specifically in patients 
with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Two types of radiation peri-
carditis  occur:  an  acute  inflammatory,  effusive  pericarditis  occurring 
within  months  of  irradiation,  which  usually  resolves  spontaneously, 
and a chronic effusive pericarditis that may appear up to 20 years after 
radiation therapy and is accompanied by a thickened pericardium.

Most patients with pericardial metastasis are asymptomatic. How-
ever,  the  common  symptoms  are  dyspnea,  cough,  chest  pain,  ortho-
pnea, and weakness. Pleural effusion, sinus tachycardia, jugular venous 
distention, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, and cyanosis are the most 
frequent physical findings. Relatively specific diagnostic findings, such 
as paradoxical pulse, diminished heart sounds, pulsus alternans (pulse 
waves alternating between those of greater and lesser amplitude with 
successive  beats),  and  friction  rub  are  less  common  than  with  non-
malignant  pericardial  disease.  Chest  radiographs  and  electrocardio-
gram (ECG) reveal abnormalities in 90% of patients, but half of these 
abnormalities  are  nonspecific.  Echocardiography  is  the  most  helpful 
diagnostic  test.  Pericardial  fluid  may  be  serous,  serosanguineous,  or 
hemorrhagic, and cytologic examination of pericardial fluid is diagnos-
tic in most patients. Measurements of tumor markers in the pericardial 
fluid  are  not  helpful  in  the  diagnosis  of  malignant  pericardial  fluid. 
Pericardioscopy  with  targeted  pericardial  and  epicardial  biopsy  may 
differentiate neoplastic and benign pericardial disease. A combination 
of cytology, pericardial and epicardial biopsy, and guided pericardios-
copy gives the best diagnostic yield. CT scan of chest may also reveal 
the presence of a concomitant thoracic neoplasm. Cancer patients with 
pericardial effusion containing malignant cells on cytology have a very 
poor survival, ~7 weeks.

TREATMENT
Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade

Pericardiocentesis  with  or  without  the  introduction  of  sclerosing 
agents, the creation of a pericardial window, complete pericardial 
stripping, cardiac irradiation, or systemic chemotherapy are effec-
tive treatments. Acute pericardial tamponade with life-threatening 
hemodynamic instability requires immediate drainage of fluid. This 
can be quickly achieved by pericardiocentesis. The recurrence rate 
after percutaneous catheter drainage is ~20%. Sclerotherapy (peri-
cardial instillation of bleomycin, mitomycin C, or tetracycline) may 
decrease recurrences. Alternatively, subxiphoid pericardiotomy can 
be performed in 45 min under local anesthesia. Thoracoscopic peri-
cardial  fenestration  can  be  employed  for  benign  causes;  however, 
60% of malignant pericardial effusions recur after this procedure. 
In a subset of patients, drainage of the pericardial effusion is par-
adoxically  followed  by  worsening  hemodynamic  instability.  This 
so-called  “postoperative  low  cardiac  output  syndrome”  occurs  in 
up to 10% of patients undergoing surgical drainage and carries poor 
short-term survival.

 ■ INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION
Intestinal  obstruction  and  reobstruction  are  common  problems  in 
patients with advanced cancer, particularly colorectal or ovarian car-
cinoma.  However,  other  cancers,  such  as  lung  or  breast  cancer  and 
melanoma, can metastasize within the abdomen, leading to intestinal 
obstruction.  Metastatic  disease  from  colorectal,  ovarian,  pancreatic, 
gastric, and occasionally breast cancer can lead to peritoneal carcino-
matosis, with infiltration of the omentum and peritoneal surface, thus 
limiting bowel motility. Typically, obstruction occurs at multiple sites 
in peritoneal carcinomatosis. Melanoma has a predilection to involve 
the small bowel; this involvement may be isolated, and resection may 

result in prolonged survival. Intestinal pseudoobstruction is caused by 
infiltration of the mesentery or bowel muscle by tumor, involvement 
of  the  celiac  plexus,  or  paraneoplastic  neuropathy  in  patients  with 
small-cell  lung  cancer.  Paraneoplastic  neuropathy  is  associated  with 
IgG  antibodies  reactive  to  neurons  of  the  myenteric  and  submucosal 
plexuses  of  the  jejunum  and  stomach.  Ovarian  cancer  can  lead  to 
authentic  luminal  obstruction  or  to  pseudoobstruction  that  results 
when circumferential invasion of a bowel segment arrests the forward 
progression of peristaltic contractions.

The onset of obstruction is usually insidious. Pain is the most com-
mon symptom and is usually colicky in nature. Pain can also be due 
to  abdominal  distention,  tumor  masses,  or  hepatomegaly.  Vomiting 
can be intermittent or continuous. Patients with complete obstruction 
usually  have  constipation.  Physical  examination  may  reveal  abdomi-
nal  distention  with  tympany,  ascites,  visible  peristalsis,  high-pitched 
bowel  sounds,  and  tumor  masses.  Erect  plain  abdominal  films  may 
reveal multiple air-fluid levels and dilation of the small or large bowel. 
Acute cecal dilation to >12–14 cm is considered a surgical emergency 
because of the high likelihood of rupture. CT scan is useful in defining 
the extent of disease and the exact nature of the obstruction and dif-
ferentiating  benign  from  malignant  causes  of  obstruction  in  patients 
who  have  undergone  surgery  for  malignancy.  Malignant  obstruction 
is suggested by a mass at the site of obstruction or prior surgery, ade-
nopathy, or an abrupt transition zone and irregular bowel thickening at 
the obstruction site. Benign obstruction is more likely when CT shows 
mesenteric  vascular  changes,  a  large  volume  of  ascites,  or  a  smooth 
transition zone and smooth bowel thickening at the obstruction site. 
In  challenging  patients  with  obstructive  symptoms,  particularly  low-
grade small-bowel obstruction (SBO), CT enteroclysis often can help 
establish  the  diagnosis  by  providing  distention  of  small-bowel  loops. 
In this technique, water-soluble contrast is infused through a nasoen-
teric  tube  into  the  duodenum  or  proximal  small  bowel  followed  by 
CT  images.  The  prognosis  for  the  patient  with  cancer  who  develops 
intestinal obstruction is poor; median survival is 3–4 months. About 
25–30%  of  patients  are  found  to  have  intestinal  obstruction  due  to 
causes  other  than  cancer.  Adhesions  from  previous  operations  are  a 
common benign cause. Ileus induced by vinca alkaloids, narcotics, or 
other drugs is another reversible cause.

TREATMENT
Intestinal Obstruction

The  management  of  intestinal  obstruction  in  patients  with 
advanced  malignancy  depends  on  the  extent  of  the  underlying 
malignancy,  options  for  further  antineoplastic  therapy,  estimated 
life expectancy, the functional status of the major organs, and the 
extent of the obstruction. The initial management should include 
surgical  evaluation.  Operation  is  not  always  successful  and  may 
lead  to  further  complications  with  a  substantial  mortality  rate 
(10–20%).  Laparoscopy  can  diagnose  and  treat  malignant  bowel 
obstruction  in  some  cases.  Self-expanding  metal  stents  placed  in 
the gastric outlet, duodenum, proximal jejunum, colon, or rectum 
may palliate obstructive symptoms at those sites without major sur-
gery. Patients known to have advanced intraabdominal malignancy 
should  receive  a  prolonged  course  of  conservative  management, 
including nasogastric decompression. Percutaneous endoscopic or 
surgical gastrostomy tube placement is an option for palliation of 
nausea  and  vomiting,  the  so-called  “venting  gastrostomy.”  Treat-
ment  with  antiemetics,  antispasmodics,  and  analgesics  may  allow 
patients  to  remain  outside  the  hospital.  Octreotide  may  relieve 
obstructive  symptoms  through  its  inhibitory  effect  on  gastroin-
testinal  secretion.  Glucocorticoids  have  anti-inflammatory  effects 
and may help the resolution of bowel obstruction. They also have 
antiemetic effects.

 ■ URINARY OBSTRUCTION
Urinary  obstruction  may  occur  in  patients  with  prostatic  or  gyneco-
logic malignancies, particularly cervical carcinoma; metastatic disease

from  other  primary  sites  such  as  carcinomas  of  the  breast,  stomach, 
lung, colon, and pancreas; or lymphomas. Radiation therapy to pelvic 
tumors may cause fibrosis and subsequent ureteral obstruction. Blad-
der outlet obstruction is usually due to prostate and cervical cancers 
and may lead to bilateral hydronephrosis and renal failure.

Flank pain is the most common symptom. Persistent urinary tract 
infection, persistent proteinuria, or hematuria in patients with cancer 
should  raise  suspicion  of  ureteral  obstruction.  Total  anuria  and/or 
anuria  alternating  with  polyuria  may  occur.  A  slow,  continuous  rise 
in the serum creatinine level necessitates immediate evaluation. Renal 
ultrasound is the safest and cheapest way to identify hydronephrosis. 
The  function  of  an  obstructed  kidney  can  be  evaluated  by  a  nuclear 
scan. CT scan can reveal the point of obstruction and identify a retro-
peritoneal mass or adenopathy.

TREATMENT
Urinary Obstruction

Obstruction associated with flank pain, sepsis, or fistula formation 
is an indication for immediate palliative urinary diversion. Internal 
ureteral  stents  can  be  placed  under  local  anesthesia.  Percutane-
ous nephrostomy offers an alternative approach for drainage. The 
placement  of  a  nephrostomy  is  associated  with  a  significant  rate 
of  pyelonephritis.  In  the  case  of  bladder  outlet  obstruction  due 
to  malignancy,  a  suprapubic  cystostomy  can  be  used  for  urinary 
drainage.  An  aggressive  intervention  with  invasive  approaches  to 
improve the obstruction should be weighed against the likelihood 
of antitumor response, and the ability to reverse renal insufficiency 
should be evaluated.

 ■ MALIGNANT BILIARY OBSTRUCTION
This common clinical problem can be caused by a primary carcinoma 
arising in the pancreas, ampulla of Vater, bile duct, or liver or by met-
astatic  disease  to  the  periductal  lymph  nodes  or  liver  parenchyma. 
The most common metastatic tumors causing biliary obstruction are 
gastric, colon, breast, and lung cancers. Jaundice, light-colored stools, 
dark urine, pruritus, and weight loss due to malabsorption are usual 
symptoms. Pain and secondary infection are uncommon in malignant 
biliary obstruction. Ultrasound, CT scan, or percutaneous transhepatic 
or  endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiography  will  identify  the  site  and 
nature of the biliary obstruction.

TREATMENT
Malignant Biliary Obstruction

Palliative  intervention  is  indicated  only  in  patients  with  disabling 
pruritus  resistant  to  medical  treatment,  severe  malabsorption,  or 
infection.  Stenting  under  radiographic  control,  surgical  bypass, 
or  radiation  therapy  with  or  without  chemotherapy  may  alleviate 
the obstruction. The choice of therapy should be based on the site 
of obstruction (proximal vs distal), the type of tumor (sensitive to 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or neither), and the general condition 
of the patient. Stenting under radiographic or endoscopic control, 
surgical bypass, or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy 
may alleviate the obstruction. Photodynamic therapy and radiofre-
quency ablation are promising endoscopic therapies for malignant 
biliary obstruction.

Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage is an evolv-
ing  method  of  biliary  drainage  in  patients  with  malignant  biliary 
obstruction,  particularly  in  patients  whom  standard  endoscopic 
retrograde cholangiopancreatography failed.

 ■ SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION
Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) is defined as compression 
of the spinal cord and/or cauda equina by an extradural tumor mass. 
The minimum radiologic evidence for cord compression is indentation 
of  the  theca  at  the  level  of  clinical  features.  Spinal  cord  compression 

(SCC) occurs in 5–10% of patients with cancer. Epidural tumor is the 
first manifestation of malignancy in ~10% of patients. The underlying 
cancer is usually identified during the initial evaluation; lung cancer is 
the most common cause of MSCC.

Metastatic  tumor  involves  the  vertebral  column  more  often  than 
any  other  part  of  the  bony  skeleton.  Lung,  breast,  and  prostate  can-
cers  are  the  most  frequent  offenders.  Multiple  myeloma  also  has  a 
high  incidence  of  spine  involvement.  Lymphomas,  melanoma,  renal 
cell  cancer,  and  genitourinary  cancers  also  cause  cord  compression. 
The  thoracic  spine  is  the  most  common  site  (70%),  followed  by  the 
lumbosacral spine (20%) and the cervical spine (10%). Involvement of 
multiple sites is most frequent in patients with breast and prostate car-
cinoma. Cord injury develops when metastases to the vertebral body 
or pedicle enlarge and compress the underlying dura. Another cause of 
cord compression is direct extension of a paravertebral lesion through 
the  intervertebral  foramen.  These  cases  usually  involve  a  lymphoma, 
myeloma, or pediatric neoplasm. Parenchymal spinal cord metastasis 
due  to  hematogenous  spread  is  rare.  Intramedullary  metastases  can 
be  seen  in  lung  cancer,  breast  cancer,  renal  cancer,  melanoma,  and 
lymphoma,  and  are  frequently  associated  with  brain  metastases  and 
leptomeningeal disease.

Expanding extradural tumors induce injury through several mech-
anisms.  Expanding  extradural  tumors  induce  mechanical  injury  to 
axons  and  myelin.  Compression  compromises  blood  flow,  leading  to 
ischemia and/or infarction.

The most common initial symptom in patients with SCC is localized 
back pain and tenderness due to involvement of vertebrae by tumor. 
Pain is usually present for days or months before other neurologic find-
ings appear. It is exacerbated by movement and by coughing or sneez-
ing. It can be differentiated from the pain of disk disease by the fact that 
it worsens when the patient is supine. Radicular pain is less common 
than localized back pain and usually develops later. Radicular pain in 
the cervical or lumbosacral areas may be unilateral or bilateral. Radic-
ular pain from the thoracic roots is often bilateral and is described by 
patients as a feeling of tight, band-like constriction around the thorax 
and abdomen. Typical cervical radicular pain radiates down the arm; 
in the lumbar region, the radiation is down the legs. Lhermitte’s sign, 
a  tingling  or  electric  sensation  down  the  back  and  upper  and  lower 
limbs upon flexing or extending the neck, may be an early sign of cord 
compression. Loss of bowel or bladder control may be the presenting 
symptom but usually occurs late in the course. Occasionally, patients 
present with ataxia of gait without motor and sensory involvement due 
to involvement of the spinocerebellar tract.

On  physical  examination,  pain  induced  by  straight  leg  raising, 
neck flexion, or vertebral percussion may help to determine the level 
of  cord  compression.  Patients  develop  numbness  and  paresthesias  in 
the extremities or trunk. Loss of sensibility to pinprick is as common 
as  loss  of  sensibility  to  vibration  or  position.  The  upper  limit  of  the 
zone  of  sensory  loss  is  often  one  or  two  vertebrae  below  the  site  of 
compression. Motor findings include weakness, spasticity, and abnor-
mal  muscle  stretching.  An  extensor  plantar  reflex  reflects  significant 
compression. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk. Motor and sensory 
loss  usually  precedes  sphincter  disturbance.  Patients  with  autonomic 
dysfunction may present with decreased anal tonus, decreased perineal 
sensibility, and a distended bladder. The absence of the anal wink reflex 
or  the  bulbocavernosus  reflex  confirms  cord  involvement.  In  doubt-
ful  cases,  evaluation  of  postvoiding  urinary  residual  volume  can  be 
helpful. A residual volume of >150 mL suggests bladder dysfunction. 
Autonomic  dysfunction  is  an  unfavorable  prognostic  factor.  Patients 
with  progressive  neurologic  symptoms  should  have  frequent  neuro-
logic examinations and rapid therapeutic intervention. Other illnesses 
that  may  mimic  cord  compression  include  osteoporotic  vertebral 
collapse, disk disease, pyogenic abscess or vertebral tuberculosis, radi-
ation myelopathy, neoplastic leptomeningitis, benign tumors, epidural 
hematoma, and spinal lipomatosis.

Cauda equina syndrome is characterized by low back pain; dimin-
ished  sensation  over  the  buttocks,  posterior-superior  thighs,  and 
perineal  area  in  a  saddle  distribution;  rectal  and  bladder  dysfunc-
tion; sexual impotence; absent bulbocavernous, patellar, and Achilles’

reflexes;  and  variable  amount  of  lower-extremity  weakness.  This 
reflects compression of nerve roots as they form the cauda equina after 
leaving the spinal cord. The majority of cauda equina tumors are pri-
mary tumors of glial or nerve sheath origin; metastases are very rare.

Patients  with  cancer  who  develop  back  pain  should  be  evaluated 
for  SCC  as  quickly  as  possible  (Fig.  75-2).  Treatment  is  more  often 
successful  in  patients  who  are  ambulatory  and  still  have  sphincter 
control at the time treatment is initiated. Patients should have a neuro-
logic examination and plain films of the spine. Those whose physical 
examination suggests cord compression should receive dexamethasone 
starting immediately and undergo MRI imaging.

Erosion  of  the  pedicles  (the  “winking  owl”  sign)  is  the  earliest 
radiologic  finding  of  vertebral  tumor  in  plain  films;  however,  plain 
films  are  insensitive.  Other  radiographic  changes  include  increased 
intrapedicular distance, vertebral destruction, lytic or sclerotic lesions, 
scalloped  vertebral  bodies,  and  vertebral  body  collapse.  Vertebral 
collapse  is  not  a  reliable  indicator  of  the  presence  of  tumor;  ~20% 
of cases of vertebral collapse, particularly those in older patients and 
postmenopausal  women,  are  due  not  to  cancer  but  to  osteoporosis. 
Also, a normal appearance on plain films of the spine does not exclude 
the diagnosis of cancer. The role of bone scans in the detection of cord 
compression is not clear; this method is sensitive but less specific than 
spinal radiography.

The full-length image of the cord provided by MRI is the imaging 
procedure of choice. Multiple epidural metastases are noted in 25% of 
patients  with  cord  compression,  and  their  presence  influences  treat-
ment plans. On T1-weighted images, good contrast is noted between 
the  cord,  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  and  extradural  lesions.  Owing 
to  its  sensitivity  in  demonstrating  the  replacement  of  bone  marrow 
by  tumor,  MRI  can  show  which  parts  of  a  vertebra  are  involved  by 
tumor. MRI also visualizes intraspinal extradural masses compressing 

the  cord.  T2-weighted  images  are  most  useful  for  the  demonstration 
of  intramedullary  pathology.  Gadolinium-enhanced  MRI  can  help 
to delineate intramedullary disease. MRI is as good as or better than 
myelography  plus  postmyelogram  CT  scan  in  detecting  metastatic 
epidural  disease  with  cord  compression.  Myelography  should  be 
reserved  for  patients  who  have  poor  MRIs  or  who  cannot  undergo 
MRI promptly. CT scan in conjunction with myelography enhances the 
detection of small areas of spinal destruction.

In  patients  with  cord  compression  and  an  unknown  primary 
tumor, a simple workup including chest radiography, mammography, 
measurement of prostate-specific antigen, and abdominal CT usually 
reveals the underlying malignancy.

TREATMENT
Spinal Cord Compression

The treatment of patients with SCC is aimed at relief of pain and 
restoration/preservation  of  neurologic  function  (Fig.  75-2).  Man-
agement of MSCC requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Radiation  therapy  plus  glucocorticoids  is  generally  the  initial 
treatment of choice for most patients with SCC. The management 
decision  of  SCC  involves  assessment  of  neurologic  (N),  onco-
logic  (O),  mechanical  (M),  and  systemic  factors  (S).  NOMS  was 
developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) 
researchers to provide an algorithm for management of SCC. The 
neurologic  assessment  is  based  on  the  degree  of  epidural  SCC, 
myelopathy,  and/or  functional  radiculopathy.  Oncologic  assess-
ment  involves  the  radiosensitivity  of  the  tumor  type.  In  patients 
with radioresistant tumors, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 
is the preferred approach if radiation is appropriate. Safe delivery

of SBRT requires a 2- to 3-mm margin away from the spinal cord. 
Separation surgery followed by SBRT is necessary in patients with 
high-grade  SCC  due  to  radioresistant  tumors.  Separation  surgery 
is  the  circumferential  excision  of  epidural  tumor  to  reconstitute 
the thecal sac and provide a 2-mm margin for safe delivery of an 
ablative  radiation  dose.  In  patients  with  mechanical  instability  or 
retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal or cord, a sur-
gical approach is the treatment of choice. Systemic factors that need 
to be considered are the extent of disease and medical comorbidities 
that determine the patient’s ability to tolerate planned therapy. Che-
motherapy may have a role in patients with chemosensitive tumors 
who have had prior radiotherapy to the same region and who are 
not candidates for surgery. Patients who previously received radio-
therapy for MSCC with an in-field tumor progression can be treated 
with reirradiation with spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) if they 
are not surgical candidates.

Patients  with  painful  pathologic  compression  fractures  without 
spinal instability may benefit from percutaneous vertebroplasty or 
kyphoplasty, the injection of acrylic cement into a collapsed vertebra 
to stabilize the fracture. Pain palliation is common, and local antitu-
mor effects have been noted. Cement leakage may cause symptoms 
in  ~10%  of  patients.  Bisphosphonates  and/or  denosumab  may  be 
helpful in prevention of SCC in patients with bony involvement.

The histology of the tumor is an important determinant of both 
recovery  and  survival.  Rapid  onset  and  progression  of  signs  and 
symptoms are poor prognostic features.

 ■ INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE
About  25%  of  patients  with  cancer  die  with  intracranial  metastases. 
The cancers that most often metastasize to the brain are lung and breast 
cancers and melanoma. Brain metastases often occur in the presence of 
systemic disease, and they frequently cause major symptoms, disability, 
and  early  death.  The  initial  presentation  of  brain  metastases  from  a 
previously unknown primary cancer is common. Lung cancer is most 
commonly  the  primary  malignancy.  CT  scans  of  the  chest/abdomen 
and  MRI  of  the  brain  as  the  initial  diagnostic  studies  can  identify  a 
biopsy site in most patients.

The signs and symptoms of a metastatic brain tumor are similar to 
those of other intracranial expanding lesions: headache, nausea, vom-
iting,  behavioral  changes,  seizures,  and  focal,  progressive  neurologic 
changes.  Occasionally  the  onset  is  abrupt,  resembling  a  stroke,  with 
the sudden appearance of headache, nausea, vomiting, and neurologic 
deficits. This picture is usually due to hemorrhage into the metastasis. 
Melanoma, germ cell tumors, and renal cell cancers have a particularly 
high incidence of intracranial bleeding. The tumor mass and surround-
ing edema may cause obstruction of the circulation of CSF, with result-
ing  hydrocephalus.  Patients  with  increased  intracranial  pressure  may 
have  papilledema  with  visual  disturbances  and  neck  stiffness.  As  the 
mass enlarges, brain tissue may be displaced through the fixed cranial 
openings, producing various herniation syndromes.

MRI  is  superior  to  CT  scan.  Gadolinium-enhanced  MRI  is  more 
sensitive  than  CT  at  revealing  meningeal  involvement  and  small 
lesions,  particularly  in  the  brainstem  or  cerebellum.  The  MRI  of  the 
brain shows brain metastases as multiple enhancing lesions of various 
sizes with surrounding areas of low-density edema.

Intracranial  hypertension  (“pseudotumor  cerebri”)  secondary  to 
tretinoin therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia has been reported 
as another cause of intracranial pressure in the setting of a malignancy.

TREATMENT
Increased Intracranial Pressure

Dexamethasone  is  the  best  initial  treatment  for  all  symptomatic 
patients  with  brain  metastases.  The  current  success  of  immuno-
therapy approaches for primary and metastatic brain tumors may 
preclude or limit glucocorticoid use since it may decrease antitumor 
response.  Bevacizumab  should  be  considered  in  patients  who  are 
unable to wean completely off of steroids as well as those who have 

symptomatic  brain  edema  and  are  on  immunotherapy.  Patients 
with multiple lesions should usually receive whole-brain radiation. 
Patients  with  a  single  brain  metastasis  and  with  controlled  extra-
cranial  disease  may  be  treated  with  surgical  excision  followed  by 
whole-brain radiation therapy, especially if they are aged <60 years. 
Radioresistant  tumors  should  be  resected  if  possible.  Stereotactic 
radiosurgery  (SRS)  is  recommended  in  patients  with  a  limited 
number of brain metastases (one to four) who have stable, systemic 
disease  or  reasonable  systemic  treatment  options  and  in  patients 
who  have  a  small  number  of  metastatic  lesions  in  whom  whole-
brain  radiation  therapy  has  failed.  With  a  gamma  knife  or  linear 
accelerator, multiple small, well-collimated beams of ionizing radi-
ation  destroy  lesions  seen  on  MRI.  Some  patients  with  increased 
intracranial  pressure  associated  with  hydrocephalus  may  benefit 
from  shunt  placement.  If  neurologic  deterioration  is  not  reversed 
with medical therapy, ventriculotomy to remove CSF or craniotomy 
to remove tumors or hematomas may be necessary.

Targeted agents and checkpoint inhibitors have significant activ-
ity  in  brain  metastases  from  non-small-cell  lung  cancer,  breast 
cancer, renal cancer, and melanoma.

 ■ NEOPLASTIC MENINGITIS
Tumor involving the leptomeninges is a complication of both primary 
central nervous system (CNS) tumors and tumors that metastasize to 
the CNS. The incidence is estimated at 3–8% of patients with cancer. 
Melanoma,  breast  and  lung  cancer,  lymphoma  (including  AIDS- 
associated), and acute leukemia are the most common causes. The lob-
ular or triple-negative subtypes of breast cancer, as well as tumors with 
expression of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or 
the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement in non-small-
cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC),  are  more  likely  to  have  CNS  involvement 
including  neoplastic  meningitis  and  brain  metastases.  Synchronous 
intraparenchymal brain metastases are evident in 11–31% of patients 
with  neoplastic  meningitis.  Leptomeningeal  seeding  is  frequent  in 
patients undergoing resection of brain metastases or receiving stereo-
tactic radiotherapy for brain metastases.

Patients  typically  present  with  multifocal  neurologic  signs  and 
symptoms,  including  headache,  gait  abnormality,  mental  changes, 
nausea, vomiting, seizures, back or radicular pain, and limb weakness. 
Signs  include  cranial  nerve  palsies,  extremity  weakness,  paresthesia, 
and decreased deep tendon reflexes.

Diagnosis  is  made  by  demonstrating  malignant  cells  in  the  CSF; 
however,  up  to  40%  of  patients  may  have  false-negative  CSF  cytol-
ogy. An elevated CSF protein level is nearly always present (except in 
HTLV-1–associated  adult  T-cell  leukemia).  Patients  with  neurologic 
signs  and  symptoms  consistent  with  neoplastic  meningitis  who  have 
a  negative  CSF  cytology  should  have  the  spinal  tap  repeated  at  least 
one more time for cytologic examination. MRI findings suggestive of 
neoplastic  meningitis  include  leptomeningeal,  subependymal,  dural, 
or cranial nerve enhancement; superficial cerebral lesions; intradural 
nodules;  and  communicating  hydrocephalus.  Spinal  cord  imaging 
by  MRI  is  a  necessary  component  of  the  evaluation  of  nonleukemia 
neoplastic meningitis because ~20% of patients have cord abnormal-
ities,  including  intradural  enhancing  nodules  that  are  diagnostic  for 
leptomeningeal  involvement.  Cauda  equina  lesions  are  common,  but 
lesions  may  be  seen  anywhere  in  the  spinal  canal.  The  value  of  MRI 
for the diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease is limited in patients with 
hematopoietic malignancy. Radiolabeled CSF flow studies are abnor-
mal  in  up  to  70%  of  patients  with  neoplastic  meningitis;  ventricular 
outlet  obstruction,  abnormal  flow  in  the  spinal  canal,  or  impaired 
flow over the cerebral convexities may affect distribution of intrathecal 
chemotherapy,  resulting  in  decreased  efficacy  or  increased  toxicity. 
Radiation  therapy  may  correct  CSF  flow  abnormalities  before  use 
of  intrathecal  chemotherapy.  Neoplastic  meningitis  can  also  lead  to 
intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus. Placement of a ventricu-
loperitoneal shunt may effectively palliate symptoms in these patients.
The  development  of  neoplastic  meningitis  usually  occurs  in  the 
setting of uncontrolled cancer outside the CNS; thus, prognosis is poor

PART 4Oncology and Hematology(median survival 10–12 weeks). However, treatment of the neoplastic 
meningitis may successfully alleviate symptoms and control the CNS 
spread.

TREATMENT
Neoplastic Meningitis

Chemotherapy provided by either intrathecal injection or systemic 
routes  is  used  to  control  leptomeningeal  disease  throughout  the 
entire  neuroaxis.  Intrathecal  chemotherapy,  usually  methotrexate, 
cytarabine,  or  thiotepa,  is  delivered  by  lumbar  puncture  or  by  an 
intraventricular reservoir (Ommaya). Among solid tumors, breast 
cancer  responds  best  to  therapy.  Focal  radiotherapy  may  have  a 
role  in  bulky  disease  and  in  symptomatic  or  obstructive  lesions. 
Targeted therapy such as systemically administered EGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small-cell lung cancer may lead to 
improvement in some patients with leptomeningeal spread. Patients 
with  neoplastic  meningitis  from  either  acute  leukemia  or  lym-
phoma may be cured of their CNS disease if the systemic disease 
can be eliminated.

 ■ SEIZURES
Seizures  occurring  in  a  patient  with  cancer  can  be  caused  by  the 
tumor itself, by metabolic disturbances, by radiation injury, by cerebral 
infarctions,  by  chemotherapy-related  encephalopathies,  or  by  CNS 
infections.  Metastatic  disease  to  the  CNS  is  the  most  common  cause 
of  seizures  in  patients  with  cancer.  However,  seizures  occur  more 
frequently  in  primary  brain  tumors  than  in  metastatic  brain  lesions. 
Seizures  are  a  presenting  symptom  of  CNS  metastasis  in  6–29%  of 
cases. Approximately 10% of patients with CNS metastasis eventually 
develop seizures. Tumors that affect the frontal, temporal, and parietal 
lobes are more commonly associated with seizures than are occipital 
lesions.  Both  early  and  late  seizures  are  uncommon  in  patients  with 
posterior fossa and sellar lesions. Seizures are common in patients with 
CNS metastases from melanoma and low-grade primary brain tumors. 
Very  rarely,  cytotoxic  drugs  such  as  etoposide,  busulfan,  ifosfamide, 
and chlorambucil cause seizures. Treatment with bispecific antibodies 
and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells may also cause CNS tox-
icity including seizures and encephalopathy. Another cause of seizures 
related  to  drug  therapy  is  reversible  posterior  leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS). Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunother-
apies have been associated with the development of RPLS. RPLS occurs 
in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow or solid-organ trans-
plantation. RPLS is characterized by headache, altered consciousness, 
generalized seizures, visual disturbances, hypertension, and symmetric 
posterior cerebral white matter vasogenic edema on CT/MRI. Seizures 
may begin focally but are typically generalized.

TREATMENT
Seizures

Patients  in  whom  seizures  due  to  CNS  metastases  have  been 
demonstrated  should  receive  anticonvulsive  treatment  with  phe-
nytoin or levetiracetam. If this is not effective, valproic acid can be 
added.  Prophylactic  anticonvulsant  therapy  is  not  recommended. 
In postcraniotomy patients, prophylactic antiepileptic drugs should 
be  withdrawn  during  the  first  week  after  surgery.  Most  antisei-
zure  medications  including  phenytoin  induce  cytochrome  P450 
(CYP450), which alters the metabolism of many antitumor agents, 
including  irinotecan,  taxanes,  and  etoposide  as  well  as  molecular 
targeted  agents,  including  imatinib,  gefitinib,  erlotinib,  tipifarnib, 
sorafenib,  sunitinib,  temsirolimus,  everolimus,  and  vemurafenib. 
Levetiracetam and topiramate are anticonvulsant agents not metab-
olized by the hepatic CYP450 system and do not alter the metab-
olism of antitumor agents. They have become the preferred drugs. 
Surgical  resection  and  other  antitumor  treatments  such  as  radio-
therapy and chemotherapy may improve seizure control.

 ■ PULMONARY AND INTRACEREBRAL 
LEUKOSTASIS
Hyperleukocytosis and the leukostasis syndrome associated with it are 
potentially  fatal  complications  of  acute  leukemia  (particularly  mye-
loid leukemia) that can occur when the peripheral blast cell count is 
>100,000/mL.  The  frequency  of  hyperleukocytosis  is  5–13%  in  acute 
myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  and  10–30%  in  acute  lymphoid  leukemia; 
however,  leukostasis  is  rare  in  lymphoid  leukemia.  At  such  high 
blast  cell  counts,  blood  viscosity  is  increased,  blood  flow  is  slowed 
by  aggregates  of  tumor  cells,  and  the  primitive  myeloid  leukemic 
cells  are  capable  of  invading  through  the  endothelium  and  causing 
hemorrhage.  Brain  and  lung  are  most  commonly  affected.  Patients 
with  brain  leukostasis  may  experience  stupor,  headache,  dizziness, 
tinnitus,  visual  disturbances,  ataxia,  confusion,  coma,  or  sudden 
death.  On  examination,  papilledema,  retinal  vein  distension,  retinal 
hemorrhages,  and  focal  deficit  may  be  present.  Pulmonary  leukosta-
sis  may  present  as  respiratory  distress  and  hypoxemia  and  progress 
to  respiratory  failure.  Chest  radiographs  may  be  normal  but  usually 
show  interstitial  or  alveolar  infiltrates.  Hyperleukocytosis  rarely  may 
cause acute leg ischemia, renal vein thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, 
bowel  infraction,  and  priapism.  Arterial  blood  gas  results  should  be 
interpreted  cautiously.  Rapid  consumption  of  plasma  oxygen  by  the 
markedly increased number of white blood cells can cause spuriously 
low arterial oxygen tension. Pulse oximetry is the most accurate way of 
assessing oxygenation in patients with hyperleukocytosis. Hydroxyurea 
can rapidly reduce a high blast cell count while the diagnostic workup 
is in progress. After the diagnosis is established, the patient should start 
quickly with effective induction chemotherapy. Leukapheresis should 
be used in patients with symptoms of hyperleukocytosis. Patients with 
hyperleukocytosis  are  also  at  the  risk  for  disseminated  intravascular 
coagulation and tumor lysis syndrome. The clinician should monitor 
the patient for these complications and take preventive and therapeu-
tic  actions  during  induction  therapy.  Intravascular  volume  depletion 
and unnecessary blood transfusions may increase blood viscosity and 
worsen the leukostasis syndrome. Leukostasis is very rarely a feature of 
the high white cell counts associated with chronic lymphoid or chronic 
myeloid leukemia.

When acute promyelocytic leukemia is treated with differentiating 
agents like tretinoin and arsenic trioxide, cerebral or pulmonary leu-
kostasis may occur as tumor cells differentiate into mature neutrophils. 
This  complication  can  be  largely  avoided  by  using  cytotoxic  chemo-
therapy together with the differentiating agents.

 ■ HEMOPTYSIS
Hemoptysis  may  be  caused  by  nonmalignant  conditions,  but  lung 
cancer accounts for a large proportion of cases. Up to 20% of patients 
with lung cancer have hemoptysis some time in their course. Endobro-
nchial metastases from carcinoid tumors, breast cancer, colon cancer, 
kidney cancer, and melanoma may also cause hemoptysis. The volume 
of bleeding is often difficult to gauge. Massive hemoptysis is defined 
as >200–600 mL of blood produced in 24 h. However, any hemoptysis 
should  be  considered  massive  if  it  threatens  life.  When  respiratory 
difficulty  occurs,  hemoptysis  should  be  treated  emergently.  The  first 
priorities are to maintain the airway, optimize oxygenation, and stabi-
lize the hemodynamic status. If the bleeding side is known, the patient 
should be placed in a lateral decubitus position, with the bleeding side 
down  to  prevent  aspiration  into  the  unaffected  lung,  and  given  sup-
plemental oxygen. If large-volume bleeding continues or the airway is 
compromised, the patient should be intubated and undergo emergency 
bronchoscopy.  If  the  site  of  bleeding  is  detected,  either  the  patient 
undergoes a definitive surgical procedure or the lesion is treated with a 
neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, argon plasma 
coagulation,  or  electrocautery.  In  stable  patients,  multidetector  CT 
angiography  delineates  bronchial  and  nonbronchial  systemic  arter-
ies  and  identifies  the  source  of  bleeding  and  underlying  pathology 
with high sensitivity. Massive hemoptysis usually originates from the 
high-pressure  bronchial  circulation.  Bronchial  artery  embolization  is 
considered a first-line definitive procedure for managing hemoptysis. 
Bronchial artery embolization may control brisk bleeding in 75–90% of 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   571

21/01/22   3:48 PM

 
 
572

patients, permitting the definitive surgical procedure to be done more 
safely if it is appropriate.

Embolization without definitive surgery is associated with rebleed-
ing in 20–50% of patients. Recurrent hemoptysis usually responds to a 
second embolization procedure. A postembolization syndrome charac-
terized by pleuritic pain, fever, dysphagia, and leukocytosis may occur; 
it lasts 5–7 days and resolves with symptomatic treatment. Bronchial or 
esophageal wall necrosis, myocardial infarction, and spinal cord infarc-
tion are rare complications. Surgery, as a salvage strategy, is indicated 
after failure of embolization and is associated with better survival when 
performed in a nonurgent setting.

Pulmonary hemorrhage with or without hemoptysis in hematologic 
malignancies  is  often  associated  with  fungal  infections,  particularly 
Aspergillus spp. After granulocytopenia resolves, the lung infiltrates in 
aspergillosis may cavitate and cause massive hemoptysis. Thrombocy-
topenia and coagulation defects should be corrected, if possible. Sur-
gical evaluation is recommended in patients with aspergillosis-related 
cavitary lesions.

Bevacizumab,  an  antibody  to  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)  that  inhibits  angiogenesis,  has  been  associated  with  life- 
threatening  hemoptysis  in  patients  with  non-small-cell  lung  cancer, 
particularly  of  squamous  cell  histology.  Non-small-cell  lung  cancer 
patients with cavitary lesions or previous hemoptysis (≥2.5 mL) within 
the past 3 months have higher risk for pulmonary hemorrhage.
 ■ AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION
Airway  obstruction  refers  to  a  blockage  at  the  level  of  the  mainstem 
bronchi or above. It may result either from intraluminal tumor growth 
or from extrinsic compression of the airway. The most common cause 
of  malignant  upper  airway  obstruction  is  invasion  from  an  adjacent 
primary tumor, most commonly lung cancer, followed by esophageal, 
thyroid,  and  mediastinal  malignancies  including  lymphomas.  Extra-
thoracic  primary  tumors  such  as  renal,  colon,  or  breast  cancer  can 
cause  airway  obstruction  through  endobronchial  and/or  mediastinal 
lymph node metastases. Patients may present with dyspnea, hemopty-
sis,  stridor,  wheezing,  intractable  cough,  postobstructive  pneumonia, 
or  hoarseness.  Chest  radiographs  usually  demonstrate  obstructing 
lesions. CT scans reveal the extent of tumor. Cool, humidified oxygen, 
glucocorticoids, and ventilation with a mixture of helium and oxygen 
(Heliox) may provide temporary relief. If the obstruction is proximal to 
the larynx, a tracheostomy may be lifesaving. For more distal obstruc-
tions, particularly intrinsic lesions incompletely obstructing the airway, 
bronchoscopy  with  mechanical  debulking  and  dilation  or  ablational 
treatments  including  laser  treatment,  photodynamic  therapy,  argon 
plasma coagulation, electrocautery, or stenting can produce immediate 
relief in most patients (Fig. 75-3). However, radiation therapy (either 
external-beam irradiation or brachytherapy) given together with gluco-
corticoids may also open the airway. Symptomatic extrinsic compres-
sion may be palliated by stenting. Patients with primary airway tumors 
such as squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, adenocystic carci-
noma, or non-small-cell lung cancer, if resectable, should have surgery.

METABOLIC EMERGENCIES
 ■ HYPERCALCEMIA
Hypercalcemia  is  the  most  common  paraneoplastic  syndrome.  Its 
pathogenesis  and  management  are  discussed  fully  in  Chaps.  93  
and 410.
 ■ SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION OF 
ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE
Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality in cancer patients, 
and  syndrome  of  inappropriate  secretion  of  antidiuretic  hormone 
(SIADH)  is  the  most  common  cause  among  patients  with  cancer. 
SIADH is discussed fully in Chaps. 93 and 381.
 ■ LACTIC ACIDOSIS
Lactic acidosis is a rare and potentially fatal metabolic complication of 
cancer. Lactic acidosis associated with sepsis and circulatory failure is a 
common preterminal event in many malignancies. Lactic acidosis in the

absence of hypoxemia may occur in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, 
or  solid  tumors.  In  some  cases,  hypoglycemia  also  is  present.  Exten-
sive involvement of the liver by tumor is often present. In most cases, 
decreased  metabolism  and  increased  production  by  the  tumor  both 
contribute to lactate accumulation. Tumor cell overexpression of certain 
glycolytic enzymes and mitochondrial dysfunction can contribute to its 
increased lactate production. HIV-infected patients have an increased 
risk of aggressive lymphoma; lactic acidosis that occurs in such patients 
may be related either to the rapid growth of the tumor or from toxic-
ity  of  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors.  Symptoms  of  lactic 
acidosis  include  tachypnea,  tachycardia,  change  of  mental  status,  and 
hepatomegaly. The serum level of lactic acid may reach 10–20 mmol/L 
(90–180  mg/dL).  Treatment  is  aimed  at  the  underlying  disease.  The 
danger from lactic acidosis is from the acidosis, not the lactate. Sodium 
bicarbonate  should  be  added  if  acidosis  is  very  severe  or  if  hydrogen 
ion production is very rapid and uncontrolled. Other treatment options 
include renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, and thiamine 
replacement. The prognosis is poor regardless of the treatment offered.
 ■ HYPOGLYCEMIA
Persistent hypoglycemia is occasionally associated with tumors other 
than  pancreatic  islet  cell  tumors.  Usually  these  tumors  are  large; 
tumors of mesenchymal origin, hepatomas, or adrenocortical tumors 
may cause hypoglycemia. Mesenchymal tumors are usually located in 
the  retroperitoneum  or  thorax.  Obtundation,  confusion,  and  behav-
ioral aberrations occur in the postabsorptive period and may precede 
the  diagnosis  of  the  tumor.  These  tumors  often  secrete  incompletely 
processed  insulin-like  growth  factor  II  (IGF-II),  a  hormone  capable 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   572

21/01/22   3:48 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyof  activating  insulin  receptors  and  causing  hypoglycemia.  Tumors 
secreting  incompletely  processed  big  IGF-II  are  characterized  by  an 
increased  IGF-II  to  IGF-I  ratio,  suppressed  insulin  and  C-peptide 
level, and inappropriately low growth hormone and β-hydroxybutyrate 
concentrations.  Rarely,  hypoglycemia  is  due  to  insulin  secretion  by 
a  non–islet  cell  carcinoma.  The  development  of  hepatic  dysfunction 
from liver metastases and increased glucose consumption by the tumor 
can contribute to hypoglycemia. If the tumor cannot be resected, hypo-
glycemia symptoms may be relieved by the administration of glucose, 
glucocorticoids, recombinant growth hormone, or glucagon.

Hypoglycemia can be artifactual; hyperleukocytosis from leukemia, 
myeloproliferative diseases, leukemoid reactions, or colony-stimulating 
factor treatment can increase glucose consumption in the test tube after 
blood is drawn, leading to pseudohypoglycemia.

 ■ ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY
In  patients  with  cancer,  adrenal  insufficiency  may  go  unrecognized 
because the symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and ortho-
static hypotension, are nonspecific and may be mistakenly attributed 
to  progressive  cancer  or  to  therapy.  Primary  adrenal  insufficiency 
may  develop  owing  to  replacement  of  both  glands  by  metastases 
(lung,  breast,  colon,  or  kidney  cancer;  lymphoma),  to  removal  of 
both  glands,  or  to  hemorrhagic  necrosis  in  association  with  sepsis 
or  anticoagulation.  Impaired  adrenal  steroid  synthesis  occurs  in 
patients  being  treated  for  cancer  with  mitotane,  ketoconazole,  or 
aminoglutethimide  or  undergoing  rapid  reduction  in  glucocorticoid 
therapy.  Megestrol  acetate,  used  to  manage  cancer  and  HIV-related 
cachexia,  may  suppress  plasma  levels  of  cortisol  and  adrenocorti-
cotropic  hormone  (ACTH).  Patients  taking  megestrol  may  develop 
adrenal  insufficiency,  and  even  those  whose  adrenal  dysfunction  is 
not symptomatic may have inadequate adrenal reserve if they become 
seriously  ill.  Paradoxically,  some  patients  may  develop  Cushing’s 
syndrome  and/or  hyperglycemia  because  of  the  glucocorticoid-like 
activity  of  megestrol  acetate.  Ipilimumab,  an  anti-CTLA-4  antibody 
used for treatment of malignant melanoma, may cause autoimmunity 
including autoimmune-like enterocolitis, hypophysitis (leading to sec-
ondary  adrenal  insufficiency),  hepatitis,  and,  rarely,  primary  adrenal 
insufficiency.  Autoimmune  hypophysitis  may  present  with  headache, 
visual  field  defects,  and  pituitary  hormone  deficiencies  manifesting 
as hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), or 
hypothyroidism. Ipilimumab-associated hypophysitis symptoms occur 
at an average of 6–12 weeks after initiation of therapy. An MRI usually 
shows  homogenous  enhancement  of  pituitary  gland.  Early  glucocor-
ticoid  treatment  and  hormone  replacement  are  the  initial  treatment. 
The role of high-dose glucocorticoids in the treatment of hypophysitis 
is not clear. High-dose glucocorticoids may not improve the frequency 
of  pituitary  function  recovery.  Autoimmune  adrenalitis  can  also  be 
observed with anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Pituitary dysfunction is usually 
permanent, requiring long-term hormone replacement therapy. Other 
checkpoint  inhibitors,  such  as  monoclonal  antibodies  targeting  pro-
grammed  cell  death-1  (PD-1),  an  inhibitory  receptor  expressed  by  T 
cells or one of its ligands (PD-L1), may cause hypophysitis infrequently 
(~1%).  Autoimmune  adrenalitis  is  more  frequent  with  use  of  PD-1/
PD-L1  than  with  CTLA-4  inhibitors,  but  incidence  is  low.  Cranial 
irradiation for childhood brain tumors may affect the hypothalamus- 
pituitary-adrenal  axis,  resulting  in  secondary  adrenal  insufficiency. 
Rarely, metastatic replacement causes primary adrenal insufficiency as 
the first manifestation of an occult malignancy. Metastasis to the pitu-
itary or hypothalamus is found at autopsy in up to 5% of patients with 
cancer, but associated secondary adrenal insufficiency is rare.

Acute  adrenal  insufficiency  is  potentially  lethal.  Treatment  of  sus-
pected  adrenal  crisis  is  initiated  after  the  sampling  of  serum  cortisol 
and ACTH levels (Chap. 386).

TREATMENT-RELATED EMERGENCIES
 ■ TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME

kalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia and is caused by the

destruction of a large number of rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells. 
Acidosis may also develop. Acute renal failure occurs frequently.

TLS  is  most  often  associated  with  the  treatment  of  Burkitt’s  lym-
phoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and other rapidly proliferating 
lymphomas,  but  it  also  may  be  seen  with  chronic  leukemias  and, 
rarely,  with  solid  tumors.  This  syndrome  has  been  seen  in  patients 
with  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  after  treatment  with  nucleosides 
like fludarabine and is increased in frequency in lymphoid neoplasms 
treated with venetoclax, a bcl-2 antagonist. TLS has been observed with 
administration  of  glucocorticoids,  hormonal  agents  such  as  letrozole 
and tamoxifen, and monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, obinutu-
zumab, ofatumumab, and gemtuzumab. TLS usually occurs during or 
shortly (1–5 days) after chemotherapy. Rarely, spontaneous necrosis of 
malignancies causes TLS.

Hyperuricemia may be present at the time of chemotherapy. Effec-
tive treatment kills malignant cells and leads to increased serum uric 
acid  levels  from  the  turnover  of  nucleic  acids.  Owing  to  the  acidic 
local  environment,  uric  acid  can  precipitate  in  the  tubules,  medulla, 
and  collecting  ducts  of  the  kidney,  leading  to  renal  failure.  Lactic 
acidosis  and  dehydration  may  contribute  to  the  precipitation  of  uric 
acid in the renal tubules. The finding of uric acid crystals in the urine 
is strong evidence for uric acid nephropathy. The ratio of urinary uric 
acid to urinary creatinine is >1 in patients with acute hyperuricemic 
nephropathy and <1 in patients with renal failure due to other causes. 
Other events may lead to renal failure in TLS. Calcium phosphate also 
precipitates in the interstitium and renal microvasculature, leading to 
nephrocalcinosis. Both types of crystals are toxic to the tubular epithe-
lium, inducing local active inflammatory and pro-oxidative responses. 
Soluble uric acid may induce hemodynamic changes, with decreased 
renal blood flow due to vasoconstriction and impaired autoregulation 
(crystal-independent pathway).

Hyperphosphatemia, which can be caused by the release of intracel-
lular phosphate pools by tumor lysis, produces a reciprocal depression 
in serum calcium, which causes severe neuromuscular irritability and 
tetany. Deposition of calcium phosphate in the kidney and hyperphos-
phatemia may cause renal failure. Potassium is the principal intracel-
lular  cation,  and  massive  destruction  of  malignant  cells  may  lead  to 
hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia in patients with renal failure may rapidly 
become life threatening by causing ventricular arrhythmias and sudden 
death.

The  likelihood  that  TLS  will  occur  in  patients  with  Burkitt’s  lym-
phoma is related to the tumor burden and renal function. Hyperurice-
mia and high serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >1500 U/L), 
both of which correlate with total tumor burden, also correlate with the 
risk of TLS. In patients at risk for TLS, pretreatment evaluations should 
include a complete blood count, serum chemistry evaluation, and urine 
analysis.  High  leukocyte  and  platelet  counts  may  artificially  elevate 
potassium  levels  (“pseudohyperkalemia”)  due  to  lysis  of  these  cells 
after the blood is drawn. In these cases, plasma potassium instead of 
serum potassium should be followed. In pseudohyperkalemia, no elec-
trocardiographic abnormalities are present. In patients with abnormal 
baseline renal function, the kidneys and retroperitoneal area should be 
evaluated by sonography and/or CT to rule out obstructive uropathy. 
Urine output should be watched closely.

TREATMENT
Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Recognition of risk and prevention are the most important steps in 
the  management  of  this  syndrome (Fig. 75-4).  The  standard  pre-
ventive approach consists of allopurinol and aggressive hydration. 
Urinary alkalization with sodium bicarbonate is no longer recom-
mended. It increases uric acid solubility, but a high pH decreases 
the  solubility  of  xanthine,  hypoxanthine,  and  calcium  phosphate, 
potentially increasing the likelihood of intratubular crystallization. 
Intravenous allopurinol may be given in patients who cannot toler-
ate oral therapy. Febuxostat, a potent nonpurine selective xanthine 
oxidase  inhibitor,  is  indicated  for  treatment  of  hyperuricemia.  It

results in fewer hypersensitivity reactions than allopurinol. Febuxo-
stat  does  not  require  dosage  adjustment  in  patients  with  mild 
to  moderate  renal  impairment.  Febuxostat  achieved  significantly 
superior  serum  uric  acid  control  in  comparison  to  allopurinol  in 
patients with hematologic malignancies at intermediate to high TLS 
risk. In some cases, uric acid levels cannot be lowered sufficiently 
with the standard preventive approach. Rasburicase (recombinant 
urate oxidase) can be effective in these instances, particularly when 
renal failure is present. Urate oxidase is missing from primates and 
catalyzes the conversion of poorly soluble uric acid to readily sol-
uble allantoin. Rasburicase acts rapidly, decreasing uric acid levels 
within hours; however, it may cause hypersensitivity reactions such 
as bronchospasm, hypoxemia, and hypotension. Rasburicase should 
also be administered to high-risk patients for TLS prophylaxis. Ras-
buricase  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficiency who are unable to break down hydrogen 
peroxide, an end product of the urate oxidase reaction. Rasburicase 
is known to cause ex vivo enzymatic degradation of uric acid in test 
tube  at  room  temperature.  This  leads  to  spuriously  low  uric  acid 
levels during laboratory monitoring of the patient with TLS. Sam-
ples  must  be  cooled  immediately  to  deactivate  the  urate  oxidase. 
Despite aggressive prophylaxis, TLS and/or oliguric or anuric renal 
failure may occur. Renal replacement therapy is often necessary and 
should be considered early in the course. Hemodialysis is preferred. 
Hemofiltration  offers  a  gradual,  continuous  method  of  removing 
cellular by-products and fluid.

 ■ HUMAN ANTIBODY INFUSION REACTIONS
The initial infusion of human or humanized antibodies (e.g., rituximab, 
gemtuzumab, trastuzumab, alemtuzumab, panitumumab, brentuximab 
vedotin, blinatumomab) is associated with fever, chills, nausea, asthe-
nia, and headache in up to half of treated patients. Bronchospasm and 
hypotension occur in 1% of patients. Severe manifestations including 
pulmonary  infiltrates,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS), 
and cardiogenic shock occur rarely. Laboratory manifestations include 
elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels, thrombocytopenia, and pro-
longation  of  prothrombin  time.  The  pathogenesis  is  thought  to  be 
activation  of  immune  effector  processes  (cells  and  complement)  and 
release  of  inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor  α, 
interferon γ, interleukin (IL) 6, and IL-10 (cytokine release syndrome 
[CRS]).  Although  its  origins  are  not  completely  understood,  CRS  is 
believed  to  be  due  to  activation  of  a  variety  of  cell  types  including 
monocytes/macrophages and T and B lymphocytes. Hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH)/macrophage  activation  syndrome  (MAS) 
can  develop  as  part  of  CRS  and  usually  is  a  manifestation  of  severe 
CRS.

Severe CRS may require intensive support for ARDS and resistant 
hypotension.  Emerging  clinical  experience  at  several  institutions 
has  concluded  that  tocilizumab  is  an  effective  treatment  for  severe 
or  life-threatening  CRS.  Tocilizumab  prevents  IL-6  binding  to  both 
cell-associated and soluble IL-6 receptors and therefore inhibits both 
classical  and  trans-IL-6  signaling.  Other  cytokine-directed  therapies, 
such  as  siltuximab,  a  chimeric  anti-IL-6  monoclonal  antibody,  and 
anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, have been used.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyAdoptive transfer of CAR-engineered T cells is a promising therapy 
for cancers. The most common acute toxicity of CAR T cells is CRS. 
CAR T cell–associated CRS may be associated with cardiac dysfunc-
tion and neurotoxicity. The management includes supportive care and 
tocilizumab.

Severe reactions from rituximab have occurred with high numbers 
(>50 × 109 lymphocytes) of circulating cells bearing the target antigen 
(CD20) and have been associated with a rapid fall in circulating tumor 
cells, mild electrolyte evidence of TLS, and, very rarely, death. In addi-
tion, increased liver enzymes, d-dimer, and LDH and prolongation of 
the prothrombin time may occur. Diphenhydramine, hydrocortisone, 
and acetaminophen can often prevent or suppress the infusion-related 
symptoms. If they occur, the infusion is stopped and restarted at half 
the initial infusion rate after the symptoms have abated.

 ■ HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and, less commonly, thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Chap. 317) may rarely occur after 
treatment  with  antineoplastic  drugs,  including  mitomycin,  gemcita-
bine, cisplatin, bleomycin, and proteasome inhibitors, and with VEGF 
inhibitors. Mitomycin and gemcitabine are the most common offend-
ers. Unlike mitomycin, there is no clear-cut relationship between the 
cumulative dose of gemcitabine and risk of HUS. It occurs most often 
in patients with gastric, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and breast carci-
noma.  In  one  series,  35%  of  patients  were  without  evident  cancer  at 
the time this syndrome appeared. Secondary HUS/TTP has also been 
reported as a rare but sometimes fatal complication of bone marrow 
transplantation.

HUS usually has its onset 4–8 weeks after the last dose of chemother-
apy, but it is not rare to detect it several months later. HUS is charac-
terized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and 
renal failure. Dyspnea, weakness, fatigue, oliguria, and purpura are also 
common  initial  symptoms  and  findings.  Systemic  hypertension  and 
pulmonary  edema  frequently  occur.  Severe  hypertension,  pulmonary 
edema,  and  rapid  worsening  of  hemolysis  and  renal  function  may 
occur  after  a  blood  or  blood  product  transfusion.  Cardiac  findings 
include  atrial  arrhythmias,  pericardial  friction  rub,  and  pericardial 
effusion. Raynaud’s phenomenon is part of the syndrome in patients 
treated with bleomycin.

Laboratory findings include severe to moderate anemia associated 
with  red  blood  cell  fragmentation  and  numerous  schistocytes  on 
peripheral smear. Reticulocytosis, decreased plasma haptoglobin, and 
an LDH level document hemolysis. The serum bilirubin level is usually 
normal  or  slightly  elevated.  The  Coombs  test  is  negative.  The  white 
cell count is usually normal, and thrombocytopenia (<100,000/μL) is 
almost always present. Most patients have a normal coagulation profile, 
although some have mild elevations in thrombin time and in levels of 
fibrin degradation products. The serum creatinine level is elevated at 
presentation and shows a pattern of subacute worsening within weeks 
of the initial azotemia. The urinalysis reveals hematuria, proteinuria, 
and granular or hyaline casts, and circulating immune complexes may 
be present.

The  basic  pathologic  lesion  appears  to  be  deposition  of  fibrin  in 
the walls of capillaries and arterioles, and these deposits are similar to 
those  seen  in  HUS  due  to  other  causes.  These  microvascular  abnor-
malities involve mainly the kidneys and rarely occur in other organs. 
The pathogenesis of cancer treatment–related HUS is not completely 
understood,  but  probably  the  most  important  factor  is  endothelial 
damage. Primary forms of HUS/TTP are related to a decrease in pro-
cessing of von Willebrand factor by a protease called ADAMTS13.

The case-fatality rate is high; most patients die within a few months. 
Optimal  treatment  for  chemotherapy-induced  HUS  is  debated. 
Immunocomplex  removal  through  plasmapheresis,  plasma  exchange, 
immunoadsorption,  or  exchange  transfusion,  antiplatelet  and  antico-
agulant  therapies,  and  immunosuppression  have  all  been  employed 
with varying degrees of success.

The  outcome  with  plasma  exchange  is  generally  poor,  as  in  many 
other cases of secondary TTP. Rituximab is successfully used in patients 
with chemotherapy-induced HUS as well as in ADAMTS13-deficient 

TTP. Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, is now approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and considered first line for the 
treatment of atypical HUS. Vaccination against Neisseria meningitis is 
mandatory before eculizumab is administered.

 ■ NEUTROPENIA AND INFECTION
These remain the most common serious complications of cancer ther-
apy. They are covered in detail in Chap. 74.

 ■ PULMONARY INFILTRATES
Patients with cancer may present with dyspnea associated with diffuse 
interstitial  infiltrates  on  chest  radiographs.  Such  infiltrates  may  be 
due  to  progression  of  the  underlying  malignancy,  treatment-related 
toxicities, infection, and/or unrelated diseases. The cause may be mul-
tifactorial; however, most commonly, they occur as a consequence of 
treatment. Infiltration of the lung by malignancy has been described in 
patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and breast and other solid cancers. 
Pulmonary  lymphatics  may  be  involved  diffusely  by  neoplasm  (pul-
monary  lymphangitic  carcinomatosis),  resulting  in  a  diffuse  increase 
in  interstitial  markings  on  chest  radiographs.  The  patient  is  often 
mildly  dyspneic  at  the  onset,  but  pulmonary  failure  develops  over  a 
period  of  weeks.  In  some  patients,  dyspnea  precedes  changes  on  the 
chest radiographs and is accompanied by a nonproductive cough. This 
syndrome is characteristic of solid tumors. In patients with leukemia, 
diffuse microscopic neoplastic peribronchial and peribronchiolar infil-
tration is frequent but may be asymptomatic. However, some patients 
present  with  diffuse  interstitial  infiltrates,  an  alveolar  capillary  block 
syndrome,  and  respiratory  distress.  Thickening  of  bronchovascular 
bundles  and  prominence  of  peripheral  arteries  are  CT  findings  sug-
gestive of leukemic infiltration. In these situations, glucocorticoids can 
provide symptomatic relief, but specific chemotherapy should always 
be started promptly.

Several cytotoxic agents, such as bleomycin, methotrexate, busulfan, 
nitrosoureas,  gemcitabine,  mitomycin,  vinorelbine,  docetaxel,  pacli-
taxel, fludarabine, pentostatin, and ifosfamide, may cause pulmonary 
damage. The most frequent presentations are interstitial pneumonitis, 
alveolitis,  and  pulmonary  fibrosis.  Some  cytotoxic  agents,  including 
methotrexate  and  procarbazine,  may  cause  an  acute  hypersensitivity 
reaction.  Cytosine  arabinoside  has  been  associated  with  noncardio-
genic pulmonary edema. Administration of multiple cytotoxic drugs, 
as well as radiotherapy and preexisting lung disease, may potentiate the 
pulmonary toxicity. Supplemental oxygen may potentiate the effects of 
drugs and radiation injury. Patients should always be managed with the 
lowest Fio2 that is sufficient to maintain hemoglobin saturation.

The onset of symptoms may be insidious, with symptoms including 
dyspnea,  nonproductive  cough,  and  tachycardia.  Patients  may  have 
bibasilar crepitant rales, end-inspiratory crackles, fever, and cyanosis. 
The chest radiograph generally shows an interstitial and sometimes an 
intraalveolar pattern that is strongest at the lung bases and may be sym-
metric. A small effusion may occur. Hypoxemia with decreased carbon 
monoxide diffusing capacity is always present. Glucocorticoids may be 
helpful in patients in whom pulmonary toxicity is related to radiation 
therapy or to chemotherapy. Treatment is otherwise supportive.

Molecular  targeted  agents,  imatinib,  erlotinib,  and  gefitinib  are 
potent inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. These drugs may cause interstitial 
lung  disease  (ILD).  In  the  case  of  gefitinib,  preexisting  fibrosis,  poor 
performance status, and prior thoracic irradiation are independent risk 
factors; this complication has a high fatality rate. In Japan, incidence 
of ILD associated with gefitinib was ~4.5% compared to 0.5% in the 
United States. Temsirolimus and everolimus, both esters of rapamycin 
(sirolimus),  are  agents  that  block  the  effects  of  mammalian  target  of 
rapamycin (mTOR), an enzyme that has an important role in regulat-
ing the synthesis of proteins that control cell division. These agents may 
cause ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the lung with or without diffuse 
interstitial disease and lung parenchymal consolidation. Patients may 
be asymptomatic with only radiologic findings or may be symptomatic. 
Symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and/or hypoxemia, and sometimes 
patients  present  with  systemic  symptoms  such  as  fever  and  fatigue. 
The incidence of everolimus-induced ILD also appears to be higher in

Japanese  patients.  Treatment  includes  dose  reduction  or  withdrawal 
and, in some cases, the addition of glucocorticoids.

The FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) of the PD-1 
and  PD-L1  pathway,  including  nivolumab,  pembrolizumab,  durval-
umab,  avelumab,  atezolizumab,  and  cemiplimab,  enhance  antitumor 
activity  by  blocking  negative  regulators  of  T-cell  function.  Immune-
mediated  pneumonitis  is  rare  (10%)  but  may  be  a  life-threatening 
complication  of  these  drugs.  Pneumonitis  symptoms  include  cough, 
shortness of breath, dyspnea, and fever, and often involve only asymp-
tomatic radiographic changes. Pneumonitis shows ground-glass patchy 
lesions and/or disseminated nodular infiltrates, predominantly in the 
lower lobes. Identifying the exact cause of a pneumonitis in a patient 
treated with ICIs could be challenging during the current COVID-19 
outbreak (Fig. 75-5A). Chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 include 
an  imaging  pattern  of  pure  GGO,  consolidation,  nodules,  fibrous 
stripes,  and  mixed  patterns,  with  the  distribution  slightly  predom-
inant  in  the  lower  lobe  and  peripheral  areas  of  the  lung.  Treatment 
of  immune-mediated  pneumonitis  includes  temporary  or  permanent 
withdrawal  of  drug  and  the  addition  of  high-dose  glucocorticoids 
(Fig. 75-5B).

Radiation  pneumonitis  and/or  fibrosis  are  relatively  frequent  side 
effects  of  thoracic  radiation  therapy.  It  may  be  acute  or  chronic.  
Radiation-induced  lung  toxicity  is  a  function  of  the  irradiated  lung 
volume, dose per fraction, and radiation dose. The larger the irradiated 
lung  field,  the  higher  is  the  risk  for  radiation  pneumonitis.  The  use 
of  concurrent  chemoradiation,  particularly  regimens  including  pacl-
itaxel,  increases  pulmonary  toxicity.  Radiation  pneumonitis  usually 
develops  2–6  months  after  completion  of  radiotherapy.  The  clinical 

syndrome,  which  varies  in  severity,  consists  of  dyspnea,  cough  with 
scanty sputum, low-grade fever, and an initial hazy infiltrate on chest 
radiographs. The infiltrate and tissue damage usually are confined to 
the radiation field. The CT scan may show GGOs, consolidation, fibro-
sis, atelectatic cicatrization, pleural volume loss, or pleural thickening. 
The patients subsequently may develop a patchy alveolar infiltrate and 
air  bronchograms,  which  may  progress  to  acute  respiratory  failure 
that is sometimes fatal. A lung biopsy may be necessary to make the 
diagnosis. Asymptomatic infiltrates found incidentally after radiation 
therapy need not be treated. However, prednisone should be adminis-
tered to patients with fever or other symptoms. The dosage should be 
tapered slowly after the resolution of radiation pneumonitis, because 
abrupt  withdrawal  of  glucocorticoids  may  cause  an  exacerbation  of 
pneumonia. Delayed radiation fibrosis may occur years after radiation 
therapy and is signaled by dyspnea on exertion. Often it is mild, but it 
can progress to chronic respiratory failure. Therapy is supportive.

Classic  radiation  pneumonitis  that  leads  to  pulmonary  fibrosis  is 
due to radiation-induced production of local cytokines such as platelet- 
derived growth factor β, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, and trans-
forming growth factor β in the radiation field.

SBRT is a radiotherapy treatment method that has been applied to 
the treatment of stage I lung cancers in medically inoperable patients. 
SBRT  accurately  delivers  a  high  dose  of  irradiation  in  one  or  few 
treatment fractions to an image-defined lung mass. Most of the acute 
changes after SBRT occur later than 3 months after treatment, and the 
shape of the SBRT-induced injury conforms more tightly to the tumor.
Pneumonia is a common problem in patients undergoing treatment 
for cancer (Chap 74). In patients with pulmonary infiltrates who are

ential diagnosis.
 ■ NEUTROPENIC ENTEROCOLITIS
Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) is the inflammation and necrosis of 
the cecum and surrounding tissues that may complicate the treatment 
of  acute  leukemia.  Nevertheless,  it  may  involve  any  segment  of  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  including  small  intestine,  appendix,  and  colon. 
This complication has also been seen in patients with other forms of 
cancer  treated  with  taxanes,  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan,  vinorelbine, 
cisplatin, carboplatin, and high-dose chemotherapy (Fig. 75-6). It also 
has been reported in patients with AIDS, aplastic anemia, cyclic neu-
tropenia, idiosyncratic drug reactions involving antibiotics, and immu-
nosuppressive  therapies.  The  patient  develops  right  lower  quadrant 
abdominal pain, often with rebound tenderness and a tense, distended 
abdomen, in a setting of fever and neutropenia. Watery diarrhea (often 
containing sloughed mucosa) and bacteremia are common, and bleed-
ing may occur. Plain abdominal films are generally of little value in the 
diagnosis; CT scan may show marked bowel wall thickening, particu-
larly in the cecum, with bowel wall edema, mesenteric stranding, and 
ascites,  and  may  help  to  differentiate  neutropenic  colitis  from  other 
abdominal disorders such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, and Clostrid-
ium  difficile–associated  colitis  in  this  high-risk  population.  Patients

with  bowel  wall  thickness  >10  mm  on  ultrasonogram  have  higher 
mortality rates. However, bowel wall thickening is significantly more 
prominent in patients with C. difficile colitis. Pneumatosis intestinalis 
is a more specific finding, seen only in those with neutropenic entero-
colitis and ischemia. The combined involvement of the small and large 
bowel suggests a diagnosis of neutropenic enterocolitis. Rapid institu-
tion of broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest, and nasogastric suction 
may  reverse  the  process.  Use  of  myeloid  growth  factors  improved 
outcome significantly. Surgical intervention is reserved for severe cases 
of  neutropenic  enterocolitis  with  evidence  of  perforation,  peritonitis, 
gangrenous  bowel,  or  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  despite  correction 
of any coagulopathy.

C. difficile colitis is increasing in incidence. Newer strains of C. diffi-
cile produce ~20 times more of toxins A and B compared to previously 
studied  strains.  C.  difficile  risk  is  also  increased  with  chemotherapy. 
Antibiotic coverage for C. difficile should be added if pseudomembra-
nous colitis cannot be excluded.

 ■ HEMORRHAGIC CYSTITIS
Hemorrhagic  cystitis  is  characterized  by  diffuse  bladder  mucosal 
bleeding that develops secondary to chemotherapy (mostly cyclophos-
phamide or ifosfamide), radiation therapy, bone marrow transplanta-
tion (BMT), and/or opportunistic infections. Both cyclophosphamide 
and ifosfamide are metabolized to acrolein, which is a strong chemical 
irritant  that  is  excreted  in  the  urine.  Prolonged  contact  or  high  con-
centrations may lead to bladder irritation and hemorrhage. Symptoms 
include gross hematuria, frequency, dysuria, burning, urgency, inconti-
nence, and nocturia. The best management is prevention. Maintaining 
a  high  rate  of  urine  flow  minimizes  exposure.  In  addition,  2-mer-
captoethanesulfonate  (mesna)  detoxifies  the  metabolites  and  can  be 
coadministered with the instigating drugs. Mesna usually is given three 
times  on  the  day  of  ifosfamide  administration  in  doses  that  are  each 
20% of the total ifosfamide dose. If hemorrhagic cystitis develops, the 
maintenance of a high urine flow may be sufficient supportive care. If 
conservative management is not effective, irrigation of the bladder with 
a 0.37–0.74% formalin solution for 10 min stops the bleeding in most 
cases. N-Acetylcysteine may also be an effective irrigant. Prostaglandin 
(carboprost) can inhibit the process. In extreme cases, ligation of the 
hypogastric arteries, urinary diversion, or cystectomy may be necessary.
In  the  BMT  setting,  early-onset  hemorrhagic  cystitis  is  related  to 
drugs  in  the  treatment  regimen  (e.g.,  cyclophosphamide),  and  late- 
onset hemorrhagic cystitis is usually due to the polyoma virus BKV or 
adenovirus type 11. BKV load in urine alone or in combination with 
acute graft-versus-host disease correlates with development of hemor-
rhagic cystitis. Viral causes are usually detected by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)–based diagnostic tests. Treatment of viral hemorrhagic 
cystitis is largely supportive, with reduction in doses of immunosup-
pressive agents, if possible. No antiviral therapy is approved, although 
cidofovir was reported to be effective in a small series. Hyperbaric oxy-
gen therapy has been used successfully in patients with BKV-associated 
and cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis during hemato-
poietic stem cell transplantation, as well as in hemorrhagic radiation 
cystitis that occurs in up to 5% of patients after pelvic radiation.

 ■ HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO 
ANTINEOPLASTIC DRUGS
Many antineoplastic drugs may cause hypersensitivity reaction. These 
reactions are unpredictable and potentially life threatening. Most reac-
tions occur during or within hours of parenteral drug administration. 
Taxanes, platinum compounds, asparaginase, etoposide, procarbazine, 
and  biologic  agents,  including  rituximab,  bevacizumab,  trastuzumab, 
gemtuzumab,  cetuximab,  and  alemtuzumab,  are  more  commonly 
associated with acute hypersensitivity reactions than are other agents. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to some drugs, such as taxanes, occur dur-
ing the first or second dose administered. Hypersensitivity to platinum 
compounds occurs after prolonged exposure. Skin testing may identify 
patients with high risk for hypersensitivity after carboplatin exposure. 
Premedication  with  histamine  H1  and  H2  receptor  antagonists  and 
glucocorticoids  reduces  the  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  reaction  to 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   577

21/01/22   3:48 PM

 
 
578

taxanes,  particularly  paclitaxel.  Despite  premedication,  hypersensi-
tivity reactions may still occur. In these cases, rapid desensitization in 
the intensive care unit setting or re-treatment may be attempted with 
care, but the use of alternative agents may be required. Skin testing is 
used to assess the involvement of IgE in the reaction. Tryptase levels 
measured at the time of the reaction help to explain the mechanism of 
the reaction and its severity. Increased tryptase levels indicate underly-
ing mast cell activation. Candidate patients for desensitization include 
those who have mild to severe hypersensitivity type I, with mast cell– 
mediated and IgE-dependent reactions occurring during a chemother-
apy infusion or shortly thereafter.

76 Cancer of the Skin

Brendan D. Curti, John T. Vetto,  
Sancy A. Leachman

MELANOMA
Pigmented  lesions  are  among  the  most  common  findings  on  skin 
examination. The challenge for the physician is to distinguish benign 
lesions  from  cutaneous  melanomas  and  nonmelanoma  skin  cancers 
(NMSCs).  Both  melanoma  and  NMSC  are  increasing  in  frequency, 
and  melanoma  accounts  for  over  half  of  the  deaths  resulting  from 
skin  cancer.  Melanoma  is  an  aggressive  malignancy  of  melanocytes,  
pigment-producing  cells  that  originate  from  the  neural  crest  and 
migrate to the skin, meninges, mucous membranes, upper esophagus, 
and eyes. Melanocytes in each of these locations have the potential for 
malignant transformation, but the vast majority of melanomas arise in 
the skin, often permitting detection at a time when complete surgical 
excision  leads  to  cure.  Cutaneous  melanoma  can  occur  in  people  of 
all ages and all colors. Examples of malignant melanoma of the skin, 
mucosa, eye, and nail are shown in Fig. 76-1.

 ■ RISK FACTORS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
The epidemiologic patterns seen in melanoma reflect the genetic and 
biologic features of melanocytes and their response to environmental 
ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Clinical features that confer an increased 
risk for melanoma include: (1) vulnerability to sun damage (light/red 
coloration of skin, hair, or eyes; photodamaged skin; history of expo-
sure to natural or artificial UVR; prior history of skin cancers of any 
type); (2) abnormal growth of melanocytes (increased absolute number 
of nevi, increased size of nevi, or atypical features of moles such as mul-
tiple colors, speckles, or shapes); and (3) immunosuppression (innate, 
functional, or drug-induced). Table 76-1 summarizes melanoma risk 
factors and the relative risk associated with these factors.

The incidence and mortality rates are strongly influenced by ethnic 
and  geographic/environmental  factors,  which  superimpose  substan-
tial variability on melanoma rates. Specifically, the incidence of mela-
noma is 1/100,000 per year in populations with high skin eumelanin 
content and up to 27/100,000 per year in populations with low skin 
eumelanin.  Men  are  affected  slightly  more  than  women  (1.3:1),  and 
the median age at diagnosis is the late fifties. Melanoma is one of the 
few cancer types with increasing incidence in the United States and 
is  now  the  fifth  leading  cancer  in  men  (60,190  new  cases  estimated 
in  2020;  probability  1:28)  and  the  sixth  leading  cancer  in  women 
(40,160 new cases estimated in 2020; probability 1:41). Although these 
rankings  are  based  on  the  total  number  of  new  invasive  melanoma 
cases  (100,350  in  2020),  an  additional  95,710  cases  of  melanoma  in 
situ  are  expected  to  occur  in  2020.  Given  the  stable  or  decreasing 
mortality (see below), it seems likely that new cases include some that 
represent  overdiagnosis  of  cancers  that  would  not  progress  to  fatal  
disease.

Mortality rates begin to rise at age 55, with the greatest mortality in 
men age >65 years. In contrast to the increasing incidence, the mortal-
ity rates for melanoma are decreasing, though this trend appears less 
dramatic outside of the United States. The reasons for the decrease are 
not  entirely  clear  but  have  been  attributed  in  part  to  the  recent  suc-
cess of melanoma therapeutics on survival. After U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA)  approval  of  ipilimumab  and  vemurafenib  in 
2011, the 1-year relative survival rate increased from 42% (2008–2010) 
to  55%  (2013–2015).  The  mortality  rate  from  2013  to  2017  dropped 
annually by 7% in those aged 20–64 years old and dropped 5–6% per 
year for individuals aged ≥65 years.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The  incidence  of  both  nonmelanoma  and  melanoma  skin  cancers 
around  the  world  has  been  increasing.  Every  year,  between  2  and  
3  million  people  develop  NMSC,  and  in  2018,  there  were  300,000 
cases  of  melanoma.  A  disproportionate  number  of  cases  and  deaths 
occur  in  North  America,  Europe,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand.  The 
highly  variable  incidence  rates  of  melanoma  in  different  populations 
are due to the interplay between risk factors, including host genetics 
and  environmental  factors,  that  distribute  risk  unevenly  across  these 
populations and account for the absolute risk in different ethnic groups 
and geographic areas.

Dark-skinned  populations  (such  as  those  of  India  and  Puerto 
Rico),  blacks,  and  East  Asians  also  develop  melanoma  but  at  rates 
10–20  times  lower  than  those  in  whites.  Cutaneous  melanomas  in 
dark-skinned populations are more often diagnosed at a higher stage, 
and  patients  tend  to  have  worse  outcomes.  Surveillance,  Epidemi-
ology,  and  End  Results  (SEER)  data  (2000–2004)  reveal  that  whites 
have  the  highest  incidence  of  melanoma  at  27.2/100,000  and  that 
the  incidence  drops  substantially  in  Hispanics  (4.5/100,000),  Native 
Americans  (4.1/100,000),  Asians/Pacific  Islanders  (1.7/100,000),  and 
blacks (1.1/100,000). In nonwhite populations, the frequency of acral 
(subungual, plantar, palmar) and mucosal melanomas is much higher; 
the incidence of melanoma in black and Hispanic populations is not 
associated with ultraviolet (UV) exposure. In China, about 20,000 new 
melanomas are reported each year, and in contrast to the United States, 
mortality  is  increasing.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  in  Asians 
and  dark-skinned  populations,  more  melanomas  arise  from  acral 
and mucosal areas, which have a different biology and carry a poorer

effects of mixed ethnicity on melanoma risk.

 ■ GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MELANOMA
Approximately 20–40% of hereditary melanomas (0.2–2% of all mel-
anomas)  are  due  to  germline  mutations  in  the  cell  cycle  regulatory 
gene  cyclin-dependent  kinase  inhibitor  2A  (CDKN2A).  In  fact,  70% 
of all cutaneous melanomas have mutations or deletions affecting the 
CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p21. This locus encodes two distinct 
tumor-suppressor  proteins  from  alternate  reading  frames:  p16  and 
ARF  (p14ARF).  The  p16  protein  inhibits  CDK4/6-mediated  phospho-
rylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein, whereas 
ARF inhibits MDM2 ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53. The loss 
of  CDKN2A  results  in  inactivation  of  two  critical  tumor-suppressor 
pathways, RB and p53, which control entry of cells into the cell cycle. 
Several  studies  have  shown  an  increased  risk  of  pancreatic  cancer 
among melanoma-prone families with CDKN2A mutations. A second 
high-risk locus for melanoma susceptibility, CDK4, is located on chro-
mosome 12q13 and encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibited by 
p16. CDK4 mutations, which also inactivate the RB pathway, are much 
rarer than CDKN2A mutations. Germline mutations in the melanoma 

lineage-specific  oncogene  microphthalmia-associated  transcription 
factor  (MITF),  BRCA1-associated  protein  1  (BAP-1),  protection  of 
telomeres 1 (POT-1), and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) also 
predispose to familial melanoma with a not yet quantified high pene-
trance, based on families that have been tested.

The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is a moderate-risk inher-
ited melanoma susceptibility factor. UVR stimulates the production of 
melanocortin (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone [α-MSH]), the lig-
and for MC1R, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor that signals via 
cyclic AMP and regulates the amount and type of pigment produced 
by  melanocytes.  MC1R  is  highly  polymorphic,  and  many  among  its 
~80  variants  result  in  partial  or  full  loss  of  signaling  and  lead  to  the 
production  of  non-photoprotective  red/yellow  pheomelanins,  rather 
than  photoprotective  brown/black  eumelanins.  The  red  hair  color 
(RHC) phenotype produced by MC1R mutations includes lightly col-
ored  skin,  red  hair,  freckles,  increased  sun  sensitivity,  and  increased 
risk of melanoma. In addition to its weak UV-shielding capacity rela-
tive to eumelanin, increased pheomelanin production in patients with 
inactivating polymorphisms of MC1R also provides a UV-independent 
carcinogenic  contribution  to  melanomagenesis  via  oxidative  damage 
and reduced DNA damage repair.

Other  more  common,  low-penetrance  polymorphisms  in  genes 
related to pigmentation, nevus count, immune responses, DNA repair, 
metabolism,  and  the  vitamin  D  receptor  have  small  effects  on  mela-
noma susceptibility. In sum, ~50–60% of the genetic risk for hereditary 
melanoma can be attributed to known melanoma predisposition genes, 
with  ~40%  of  the  known  genetic  risk  attributable  to  CDKN2A.  The 
other components of inherited risk are most likely due to the presence 
of  additional  modifier  genes  and/or  shared  environmental  exposures 
of the host.
 ■ PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION
Primary  prevention  of  melanoma  and  NMSC  is  based  on  protection 
from the sun. Public health initiatives, such as the SunSmart program 
that started in Australia and is now operative in Europe and the United 
States,  have  demonstrated  that  behavioral  change  can  decrease  the 
incidence of NMSC and melanoma. Preventive measures should start 
early in life because damage from UV light begins early despite the fact 
that cancers develop years later. Early episodes of sun burns may be a 
greater risk than chronic tanning. Some individuals tan compulsively. 
There is greater understanding of tanning addiction and the cutaneous- 
neural  connections  that  may  give  rise  to  this  behavior.  Compulsive 
tanners  exhibit  differences  in  dopamine  binding  and  reactivity  in 
reward pathways in the brain, such as the basal striatum, resulting in 
cutaneous  secretion  of  β-endorphins  after  UV  exposure.  Identifying 
individuals with tanning addiction may be another prevention method. 
Regular use of broad-spectrum sunscreens that block UVA and UVB 

with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and protective clothing 
should be encouraged. Physical blockers such as zinc oxide and tita-
nium dioxide have less likelihood of being absorbed or of generating 
an allergic reaction than chemical sunscreens. Avoidance of sunburns, 
tanning beds, and midday sun exposure is recommended.

Secondary prevention comprises education and screening with the 
goal of early detection and can be individualized based on risk factors. 
A full-body skin exam is warranted in populations at higher risk for 
melanoma  such  as  patients  with  clinically  atypical  moles  (dysplastic 
nevi) and those with a personal history of melanoma. Surveillance in 
high-risk patients should be performed by a dermatologist and include 
total-body photography and dermoscopy where appropriate. Individ-
uals with three or more primary melanomas and families with at least 
one  invasive  melanoma  and  two  or  more  cases  of  melanoma  and/or 
pancreatic cancer among first- or second-degree relatives on the same 
side  of  the  family  may  benefit  from  genetic  testing.  Severely  atypical 
nevi and melanoma in situ should be removed. Early detection of small 
lesions allows the use of simpler treatment modalities with higher cure 
rates  and  lower  morbidity.  Monthly  self-screening  augments  provid-
er-based screening. Patients should be taught to recognize the clinical 
features of melanoma and advised to report any change in a pigmented 
lesion. There is evidence supporting the ability of media campaigns to 
reduce cancer mortality in lung cancer, and results from Australia’s skin 
cancer campaigns demonstrate improvement in attitude and behavior 
and  a  reduction  in  melanoma  incidence.  A  benefit/cost  analysis  in  
Australia  showed  a  return  of  $3.85  for  every  $1  invested.  Although 
the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient 
evidence  to  recommend  skin  screening  for  the  general  population, 
additional research is anticipated to find best practices for skin cancer 
detection and prevention.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The  goal  is  to  identify  a  melanoma  before  it  becomes  invasive  and 
life-threatening metastases have occurred. Early detection may be facil-
itated by applying the ABCDEs: asymmetry (benign lesions are usually 
symmetric);  border  irregularity  (most  nevi  have  clear-cut  borders); 
color  variegation  (benign  lesions  usually  have  uniform  light  or  dark 
pigment); diameter >6 mm (the size of a pencil eraser); and evolving 
(any change in size, shape, color, or elevation or new symptoms such 
as bleeding, itching, and crusting). In addition, any nevus that appears 
atypical and different from the rest of the nevi on that individual (an 
“ugly duckling”) should be considered suspicious.

The entire skin surface, including the scalp and mucous membranes, 
as well as the nails should be examined in each patient. Bright room 
illumination is important, and a hand lens or dermatoscope is helpful 
for  evaluating  variation  in  pigment  pattern.  Any  suspicious  lesions 
should be biopsied, evaluated by a specialist, or recorded by chart and/
or photography for follow-up. Dermoscopy employs low-level magni-
fication  of  the  epidermis  with  polarized  light  or  water  interface  and 
permits a more precise visualization of patterns of pigmentation than 
is possible with the naked eye (Fig. 76-2).

Biopsy  Any  pigmented  cutaneous  lesion  that  has  changed  in  size 
or  shape  or  has  other  features  suggestive  of  malignant  melanoma  is 
a  candidate  for  biopsy.  An  excisional  biopsy  with  1-  to  3-mm  mar-
gins (narrow-margin excision) is suggested. This facilitates histologic 
assessment  of  the  lesion,  permits  accurate  measurement  of  thickness 
if  the  lesion  is  melanoma,  and  constitutes  definitive  treatment  if  the 
lesion is benign. For lesions that are large or on anatomic sites where 
excisional biopsy may not be feasible (such as the face, hands, and feet), 
an incisional biopsy (partial biopsy) through the most nodular or dark-
est area of the lesion is acceptable. Incisional biopsy does not appear to 
facilitate the spread of melanoma. For suspicious lesions, every attempt 
should be made to preserve the ability to assess the deep and peripheral 
margins and to perform immunohistochemistry. Shave, saucerization, 
or punch biopsies are an acceptable alternative, particularly if the sus-
picion of malignancy is low. They should be deep enough to include the 
deepest component of the entire lesion, and any pigment at the base of 
the lesion should be removed and included with the biopsy specimen.

FIGURE 76-2  Clinical and confocal diagnostic findings of melanoma. Left panel: A clinical image of a large melanoma of a 60-year-old woman used to illustrate classic 
features of nodular melanoma (1), superficial spreading melanoma (2), and amelanotic melanoma (3). Panels 1A, 2A, and 3A correspond to the dermoscopy images taken 
at sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Sklip Dermatoscope, Sklip LLC, Las Vegas, NV). Panels 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C, 3B, and 3C are reflectance confocal microscopy images of the 
epidermis and upper dermis taken at sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Vivascope 1500 Gen 4, Caliber I.D., Rochester, NY). 1A. Site 1 dermoscopy shows a pink nodule with 
polymorphous vessels and ulceration with active bleeding consistent with malignancy. 1B. Site 1 reflectance confocal microscopy of the epidermis shows an atypical 
enlarged honeycombed pattern frequently seen in melanoma. 1C. Site 1 reflectance confocal microscopy of the upper dermis shows cerebriform nests (*) seen in nodular 
melanoma. 2A. Site 2 dermoscopy shows a pigmented area with an atypical, thickened network, blue-gray structures, and polymorphous vessels. 2B. Site 2 reflectance 
confocal microscopy of the epidermis shows an irregular honeycombed pattern and pagetoid cells with nuclei (↑) typically seen in a superficial spreading melanoma.

amelanotic melanoma. 3B. Site 3 reflectance confocal microscopy of the epidermis shows an irregular enlarged honeycombed pattern, dermal nests protruding upward into 
the epidermis (↑), and artefacts (*). 3C. Site 3 reflectance confocal microscopy image of the dermoepidermal junction shows thickened collagen bundles (*) with atypical 
polymorphous vessels (↑).

Punch biopsies are more likely to clear the deep margin but more likely 
to be positive at the radial margins; the opposite is true for shave biop-
sies. The choice of biopsy type should be guided by which is most likely 
to remove the entire lesion for histologic evaluation.

The  biopsy  should  be  read  by  a  pathologist  experienced  in  pig-
mented  lesions,  and  the  report  should  include  Breslow  thickness, 
mitotic  rate,  presence  or  absence  of  ulceration,  lymphatic  invasion, 
regression, microsatellitosis, and the status of the peripheral and deep 
margins. Breslow thickness is the greatest thickness of a primary cuta-
neous melanoma measured on the slide from the top of the epidermal 
granular layer, or from the ulcer base, to the bottom of the tumor. To 

distinguish  melanomas  from  benign  nevi  in  challenging  cases,  fluo-
rescence  in  situ  hybridization  with  multiple  probes  or  comparative 
genomic hybridization can be helpful. Gene expression profile (GEP) 
assays have been developed to determine prognosis and are commer-
cially available.

FIGURE 76-3  Cutaneous melanoma development and associated driver mutations. Chronic sun damage (A) predisposes to a lentigo maligna (in situ) (B), which can evolve 
into  lentigo  maligna  melanoma  (invasive)  (C).  Similarly,  nonchronic  sun  damage  can  initiate  melanoma  de  novo  or  in  nevomelanocytes,  where  clinical  and  histologic 
changes of atypia may be seen prior to complete transformation. Nevi (D, E) can evolve into atypical lesions (F, G), in situ melanoma (H, I), and eventually invasive nodular 
(J) or superficial spreading melanomas (K).

superficial  (radial)  growth  during  which  it  increases  in  surface  area 
but does not penetrate deeply and is most capable of being cured by 
surgical  excision.  Melanomas  with  a  radial  growth  phase  are  char-
acterized  by  irregular  and  sometimes  notched  borders,  variation  in 
pigment pattern, and variation in color. Nodular melanoma does not 
have a radial growth phase but usually presents with penetration deep 
into the skin (vertical growth phase). Desmoplastic melanoma is asso-
ciated with a fibrotic response, neural invasion, and a greater tendency 
for local recurrence. Occasionally, melanomas appear clinically to be 
amelanotic (not pigmented), in which case the diagnosis is established 
microscopically after biopsy.

Although  these  subtypes  are  clinically  distinct,  they  are  primarily 
of historical interest because this classification has minimal prognostic 
value and is not part of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
staging. Characterizing the genomic and mutational profiles of mela-
noma  has  become  increasingly  common,  informs  prognosis,  reflects 
the  mechanisms  of  tumorigenesis,  and  may  influence  surveillance 
strategies and treatment.

Genomic  The  advent  of  next-generation  sequencing  has  led  to 
whole exome sequencing of hundreds of cutaneous melanomas derived 
from  nonglabrous  skin.  This  has  revealed  very  complex  genomic 
changes  resulting  from  both  germline  (see  “Genetic  Susceptibility  to 
Melanoma”  above)  and  somatic  mutations.  Cutaneous  melanomas 
have  one  of  the  highest  somatic  mutation  rates  (>10  mutations/Mb) 
among all cancers; the majority (76% of primary tumors and 84% of 
metastatic melanomas) exhibit mutations indicative of UVR exposure. 
The  mutation  rate  varies  based  on  body  site;  melanomas  arising  in 
chronic sun-damaged skin harbor substantially more mutations than 
melanomas from non-sun-damaged skin.

Melanomas  can  harbor  thousands  of  mutations,  but  only  a  few  are 
“driver”  mutations  that  promote  cell  proliferation  or  inhibit  normal 

pathways of apoptosis or DNA repair and confer a growth advantage to the 
neoplastic cell. Some of the driver mutations for cutaneous melanoma are 
depicted in Fig. 76-3 along with the clinical evolution of melanoma lesions. 
Driver mutations are often found in combination with mutations to germ-
line susceptibility genes such as p16, which affect cell cycle arrest, and ARF, 
which  result  in  defective  apoptotic  responses  to  genotoxic  damage.  The 
altered melanocytes accumulate DNA damage and develop the malignant 
phenotype characterized by invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

A genomic classification of cutaneous melanoma has been proposed 
based on the pattern of the most prevalent mutated genes, BRAF, RAS, 
and NF1, along with a triple wild-type (WT) in which no mutations in 
these three genes are found. The pattern of DNA mutations can vary 
with the site of origin and is independent of the histologic subtype of 
the tumor. An important aspect of this classification is that the muta-
tional  profile  can  guide  therapy.  The  proliferative  pathways  affected 
by the mutations include the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase 
and  phosphatidylinositol  3′  kinase/AKT  pathways.  RAS  and  BRAF, 
members of the MAP kinase pathway, which mediate the transcription 
of  genes  involved  in  cell  proliferation  and  survival,  undergo  somatic 
mutation in melanoma and thereby generate potential therapeutic tar-
gets. NRAS is mutated in ∼20% of melanomas, and somatic activating 
BRAF mutations are found in most benign nevi and 40–50% of cuta-
neous melanomas. Neither mutation by itself appears to be sufficient to 
cause melanoma; thus, they often are accompanied by other mutations, 
such as TERT. The BRAF mutation is most commonly a T→A point 
mutation  that  results  in  a  valine-to-glutamate  amino  acid  substitu-
tion (V600E). V600E BRAF mutations are more common in younger 
patients  and  are  present  in  most  melanomas  that  arise  on  sites  with 
intermittent  sun  exposure  and  are  less  common  in  melanomas  from 
chronically sun-damaged skin (i.e., those of older patients).

Melanomas may harbor mutations in AKT (primarily in AKT3) and 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog). AKT can be amplified, and 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   582

PART 4Oncology and Hematology 
 
 
 
PTEN  may  be  deleted  or  undergo  epigenetic  silencing  that  leads  to 
constitutive  activation  of  the  PI3K/AKT  pathway  and  enhanced  cell 
survival by antagonizing the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. A loss-of-
function mutation in NF1, which can affect both the MAP kinase and 
PI3K/AKT  pathways,  has  been  described  in  10–15%  of  melanomas. 
In melanoma, these two signaling pathways (MAP kinase and PI3K/
AKT)  enhance  tumorigenesis,  chemoresistance,  migration,  and  cell 
cycle dysregulation.

 ■ PROGNOSTIC FACTORS
The most important prognostic factors for a newly diagnosed patient 
are  incorporated  in  the  staging  classification.  The  best  predictor  of 
recurrence is Breslow thickness, followed by ulceration, which together 
make up the T stage of the AJCC system for melanoma. The anatomic 
site  of  the  primary  tumor  is  also  prognostic;  favorable  sites  are  the 
forearm  and  leg,  and  unfavorable  sites  include  the  scalp,  hands,  feet, 
and mucous membranes. Women with stage I or II disease have better 
survival than men, perhaps in part because of earlier diagnosis; women 
frequently have melanomas on the lower leg, where self-recognition is 
more likely and the prognosis is better.

Older  individuals,  especially  men  >60,  have  a  tendency  toward 
delayed  diagnosis  (and  thus  thicker  tumors),  have  more  head  and 
neck and acral melanomas (which tend to have earlier vertical growth 
and  distant  metastases),  and  are  more  likely  to  develop  melanomas 
in chronically UVR-damaged skin (which are more often BRAF wild 
type, with fewer options for therapy). Other important adverse factors 
include  high  mitotic  rate,  microscopic  evidence  of  regression,  and  
lymphatic/vascular  invasion.  Clinical  features  such  as  microsatellite 
lesions  and/or  in-transit  metastases,  evidence  of  nodal  involvement, 
elevated  serum  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  and  presence  and  site 
of distant metastases all portend a higher stage and worse prognosis.

GEPs  and  machine-learning  algorithms  that  associate  genomic 
changes with clinical outcomes have been used to estimate the prog-
nosis of melanoma. A commercially available 31-gene GEP is available 
that predicts for all-site (particularly distant) relapse and incorporates 
the increased and decreased expression, as well as the dysregulation, of 
genes involved in many of the cellular processes leading to melanoma 
progression described earlier. Although this 31-gene GEP can estimate 
the probability of distant relapse, it has not supplanted the prognostic 
estimates derived from surgical staging. It is anticipated that GEPs will 
be incorporated into future cutaneous melanoma management guide-
lines,  as  they  have  been  for  uveal  melanoma,  breast  cancer,  thyroid 
cancer, and other malignancies.

 ■ STAGING
Once the diagnosis of melanoma has been made, the tumor is staged 
to determine the prognosis and aid in treatment selection. The current 
melanoma  staging  criteria  and  estimated  10-year  survival  by  stage 
are depicted in Table 76-3. The clinical stage is determined after the 
microscopic evaluation of the melanoma skin lesion and clinical and 
radiologic assessment. The pathologic stage also includes microscopic 
examination  of  clinically  negative  regional  lymph  nodes  obtained  at 
sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  (SLNB),  any  enlarged  nodes  found  on 
exam or imaging, and any suspected metastases amenable to open or 
image-guided biopsy.

All patients should have a complete history, with attention to symp-
toms  that  suggest  metastatic  disease,  such  as  new  palpable  masses, 
malaise,  weight  loss,  headaches,  changes  in  vision  or  bowel  habits, 
hemoptysis,  and  pain.  The  provider  should  look  for  persistent  dis-
ease  at  the  biopsy  site,  dermal  or  subcutaneous  nodules  that  could 
represent  satellite  or  in-transit  metastases,  and  lymphadenopathy.  A 
complete  blood  count,  complete  metabolic  panel,  and  LDH  should 
be  performed.  Although  these  tests  rarely  help  uncover  occult  meta-
static disease, a microcytic anemia would raise the possibility of bowel 
metastases,  elevated  liver  function  tests  can  suggest  liver  metastases, 
and LDH is part of the AJCC system for stage IV disease. Abnormal 
test  results  should  prompt  a  more  extensive  evaluation,  including 
computed tomography (CT) scan or a positron emission tomography 
(PET) scan (or CT/PET combined).

Despite all the above considerations, >80% of patients at presenta-
tion will have disease confined to the skin and a negative history and 
physical examination, in which case imaging is not indicated. Although 
controversial, an exception is sometimes made for very-high-risk pri-
maries  (e.g.,  >4  mm  with  ulceration)  in  which  the  chance  for  occult 
distant metastases is higher than that for a positive SLNB.

TREATMENT
Melanoma 

MANAGEMENT OF CLINICALLY LOCALIZED MELANOMA 
(STAGE I, II)
For a newly diagnosed cutaneous melanoma, wide surgical excision 
of the lesion with a margin of normal skin is necessary to remove 
all malignant cells and minimize the probability of local recurrence. 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), based on 
data from six randomized trials, recommends the following radial 
margins for a primary melanoma: in situ, 0.5–1.0 cm; invasive up 
to  1  mm  thick,  1  cm;  >1.01–2  mm,  1–2  cm;  and  >2  mm,  2  cm. 
Smaller margins may be used for special locations such as the face, 
hands, feet, and genitalia due to the higher likelihood of morbidity 
in  these  regions.  In  all  instances,  however,  inclusion  of  subcuta-
neous  fat  in  the  surgical  specimen  facilitates  adequate  thickness 
measurement and assessment of surgical margins by the patholo-
gist. When feasible, excision should go down to fascia, with fascial 
resection for thick (T4) lesions. Topical imiquimod can be used to 
treat lentigo maligna in cosmetically sensitive locations with narrow 
resection margins by promoting local immune response resulting in 
decreased local recurrence.

SLNB is a valuable staging tool providing prognostic information 
to  identify  patients  at  high  risk  for  relapse  who  may  be  candidates 
for  adjuvant  therapy.  The  first  (sentinel)  draining  node(s)  from  the 
primary  site  is  (are)  located  by  injecting  a  blue  dye  and  a  gamma- 
emitting radioisotope around the primary site. The sentinel node(s) 
then is (are) identified using a handheld gamma detector brought ster-
ilely into the operative field. The surgeon makes an incision of the area 
of uptake and looks for the blue-stained, “hot” node(s), which is (are) 
removed and subjected to histopathologic analysis with serial section-
ing  using  hematoxylin  and  eosin  and  immunohistochemical  stains 
(e.g., S100, HMB45, MART-1, and MelanA) to identify melanocytes.
NCCN guidelines recommend SLNB to patients with a 10% or 
greater chance of having tumor in the node. This includes patients 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   583

with tumors >1 mm thick (T2) or T1 tumors that have ulceration 
(T1b). Patients with a 5–10% risk of node positivity, such as those 
with  tumors  measuring  between  0.75  and  1.0  mm,  transected 
tumors, regressed tumors, or lymphovascular invasion, should also 
be considered for SLNB. The NCCN does not recommend SLNB for 
patients with a risk of a positive SLNB ≤5% such as those with mela-
nomas ≤0.75 mm thick and no high-risk features. In these patients, 
wide excision alone is the usual definitive therapy.

Patients whose SLNB is negative can either be followed or con-
sidered for a clinical trial if the primary lesion is considered high 
risk (i.e., stages IIB and IIC). Patients with a positive sentinel lymph 
node  should  undergo  imaging  (CT  or  PET  scanning)  to  rule  out 
distant metastatic disease, and if none is found (i.e., stage III), adju-
vant therapy on or off a clinical study should be offered (see next 
section). Complete lymphadenectomy for a positive sentinel lymph 
node has been shown to improve relapse-free but not overall sur-
vival, and therefore, it is no longer offered routinely. This avoids the 
morbidity  of  regional  node  dissection  in  most  patients.  However, 
patients  not  undergoing  immediate  completion  node  dissection 
should have nodal bed surveillance with physical examination and 
ultrasound at 4- to 6-month intervals for approximately 3 years to 
rule  out  isolated  nodal  bed  progression.  Complete  node  dissec-
tion  is  therefore  still  offered  to  patients  who  cannot  comply  with   
follow-up and/or forgo adjuvant therapy. 

MANAGEMENT OF REGIONALLY METASTATIC MELANOMA 
(STAGE III)
Patients with a positive sentinel lymph node, resected regional nodal 
macrometastases, or resected locoregional disease (e.g., recurrences 
in the wide excision site, within 2 cm of the site [“satellite metas-
tases”],  or  >2  cm  from  the  site  [“in-transit  metastases”])  are  all 
considered as having stage III disease. Even after complete resection 
of  stage  III  disease,  the  risk  for  progression  to  distant  metastases 
(stage IV) may be high, and adjuvant systemic therapy should be 
offered. Melanomas may recur at the edge of the incision or graft, 
as  satellite  metastases,  in-transit  metastases,  or  most  commonly, 
regional  spread  to  a  draining  lymph  node  basin.  Each  of  these 
presentations  is  managed  surgically  and,  increasingly,  with  post-
surgical adjuvant immunotherapy or targeted therapy, after which 
there  is  the  possibility  of  long-term  disease-free  survival.  Topical 
therapy  with  imiquimod  has  been  useful  for  patients  with  low- 
volume dermal lesions. Talimogene laherparepvec is an engineered, 
oncolytic  herpes  simplex  virus  type  1  that  is  FDA  approved  for 
injection of primary or recurrent melanomas including cutaneous 
and  subcutaneous  lesions  or  lymph  node  deposits  that  cannot  be 
completely removed by surgery.

Stage  III  patients  rendered  free  of  disease  after  surgery  are  at 
risk for local or distant recurrence and should be offered adjuvant 
therapy. Radiotherapy can reduce the risk of local recurrence after 
lymphadenectomy but does not influence overall survival. Patients 
with large nodes (>3–4 cm), four or more involved lymph nodes, or 
extranodal spread on microscopic examination should be consid-
ered for radiation. Systemic adjuvant therapy is indicated primarily 
for  patients  with  stage  III  disease,  but  high-risk,  node-negative 
patients (>4 mm thick or ulcerated lesions) and patients with com-
pletely resected stage IV disease also may benefit.

Current  options 

include  anti-PD-1 
for  adjuvant  therapy 
(nivolumab or pembrolizumab) or targeted therapy in melanomas 
that express a BRAF V600 mutation. Both anti-PD-1 and targeted 
therapy have been shown to confer disease-free and overall survival 
benefits in stage III and stage IV melanoma (see below for further 
discussion).  Other  agents  such  as  ipilimumab  and  interferon  α2b 
(IFN-α2b)  have  been  used  in  the  adjuvant  setting,  but  due  to  a 
higher percentage of immune-mediated side effects in the case of 
ipilimumab and limited efficacy in the case of interferon, they have 
been  supplanted  by  better  alternatives.  Ongoing  clinical  trials  are 
comparing  systemic  therapy  before  surgery  (neoadjuvant)  with 
adjuvant  treatment,  the  optimal  sequence  of  immunotherapy  and 
targeted  therapies,  and  the  utility  of  anti-PD-1  in  high-risk  stage 

II melanoma. GEP may help to identify patients with stage II or III 
melanoma who are at lower risk of recurrence and could avoid the 
toxicity and expense of adjuvant therapy.

TREATMENT
Metastatic Disease

At  diagnosis,  84%  patients  with  melanoma  will  have  stage  I  or 
II  disease  and  4%  will  present  with  metastases.  Many  others  will 
develop  metastases  after  initial  therapy  for  locoregional  disease. 
The probability of recurrence is related to initial stage, ranging from 
<5% with stage IA to >90% for subsets of patients with stage IIID 
disease  at  presentation.  Patients  with  a  history  of  melanoma  who 
develop  signs  or  symptoms  suggesting  recurrent  disease  should 
undergo  restaging  as  described  earlier.  Distant  metastases  (stage 
IV)  commonly  involve  skin  and  lymph  nodes  as  well  as  viscera, 
bone,  or  the  brain.  The  prognosis  is  better  for  patients  with  skin 
and subcutaneous metastases (M1a) than for lung (M1b) and worst 
for those with metastases to bone or other visceral organs (M1c) or 
brain (M1d). An elevated serum LDH is a poor prognostic factor 
and places the patient in stage M1c regardless of the metastatic sites. 
The 15-year survival of patients with melanoma was <10% before 
2010; however, the development of targeted therapy and immuno-
therapy  has  improved  disease-free  and  overall  survival,  especially 
for  patients  with  M1a  and  M1b  disease,  such  that  currently  the 
15-year survival exceeds 25%. Even patients with M1c disease may 
have  prolonged  survival,  and  those  who  are  progression-free  for   
>2 years after immunotherapy or targeted therapy have a high prob-
ability of living >5 years from the onset of metastasis.

FDA-approved  agents  since  2011  include  three  immune  T-cell 
checkpoint  inhibitors  (ipilimumab,  nivolumab,  and  pembrolizumab), 
combination  immunotherapy  (ipilimumab  plus  nivolumab),  six  oral 
agents  that  target  the  MAP  kinase  pathway  (the  BRAF  inhibitors 
vemurafenib,  dabrafenib,  and  encorafenib,  and  the  MEK  inhibitors 
trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib), and the oncolytic virus tali-
mogene laherparepvec (Table 76-4).

Local  modalities,  such  as  surgery  and  stereotactic  radiosur-
gery,  should  be  considered  for  patients  with  oligometastatic  dis-
ease  because  they  may  experience  long-term  disease-free  survival 
after metastasectomy or ablative high-dose-per-fraction radiation. 
Patients with solitary metastases are the best candidates, but local 
modalities  can  also  be  used  for  patients  with  metastases  at  more 
than  one  site  if  a  complete  resection  or  treatment  of  all  sites  can 
be achieved with reasonable side effects. Patients rendered free of 
disease  can  be  considered  for  adjuvant  therapy  or  a  clinical  trial 
because their risk of developing additional metastases remains high. 
Surgery can also be used as an adjunct to systemic therapy when, 
for  example,  a  few  of  many  metastatic  lesions  prove  resistant  to

immunotherapy; it may also be helpful to obtain tumor to establish 
the mutational profile of the recurrent melanoma. 

IMMUNOTHERAPY 
Checkpoint Blockade 
Immunotherapies are based on an under-
standing  of  the  control  mechanisms  of  the  normal  immune 
response.  Inhibitory  receptors  or  checkpoints,  including  CTLA-4 
and PD-1, are upregulated on T cells after engagement of the T-cell 
receptor by cognate tumor antigen in the context of the appropriate 
class I or II HLA molecules during the interaction between a T cell 
and  antigen-presenting  cell.  Immune  checkpoints  are  an  absolute 
requirement  to  ensure  proper  regulation  of  a  normal  immune 
response; however, the continued expression of inhibitory receptors 
during  chronic  infection  (hepatitis,  HIV)  and  in  cancer  patients 
leads  to  exhausted  T  cells  with  limited  potential  for  proliferation, 
cytokine production, or cytotoxicity. Checkpoint blockade with an 
antagonistic monoclonal antibody results in improved T-cell func-
tion  and  eradication  of  tumor  cells  in  preclinical  animal  models. 
Ipilimumab, a fully human IgG1 antibody that binds CTLA-4 and 
blocks inhibitory signals, was the first drug shown in a randomized 
trial  to  improve  survival  in  patients  with  metastatic  melanoma. 
Although  response  rates  are  low  (about  10%),  overall  survival  is 
improved.  Anti-CTLA-4  monotherapy  has  been  supplanted  by 
combination anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 monother-
apy due to enhanced survival and, in the case of anti-PD-1 mono-
therapy, better patient tolerance, as detailed below.

Chronic  T-cell  activation  also  leads  to  induction  of  PD-1  on 
the surface of T cells. Expression of one of its ligands, PD-L1, on 
tumor cells can protect them from immune destruction. Blockade 
of  the  PD-1:PD-L1  axis  by  intravenous  (IV)  administration  of 
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 has substantial clinical activity, including 
cure,  in  some  patients  with  advanced  melanoma  and  other  solid 
tumors with significantly less toxicity than ipilimumab. The PD-1 
blockers,  nivolumab  and  pembrolizumab,  have  been  approved  to 
treat patients with advanced melanoma. Combination T-cell check-
point therapy, blocking both inhibitory pathways with ipilimumab 
and  nivolumab,  leads  to  superior  antitumor  activity  compared  to 
treatment with either agent alone. Combined therapy with IV ipil-
imumab  and  nivolumab  is  administered  in  the  outpatient  setting 
every  3  weeks  for  four  doses  (induction),  followed  by  nivolumab 
given every 2–4 weeks (maintenance) for up to 1 year, and is associ-
ated with an objective response rate of 56% and enhanced survival 
compared  to  ipilimumab  monotherapy.  There  may  be  subsets  of 
patients,  specifically  those  who  have  >5%  expression  of  PD-1  on 
T  cells  in  a  melanoma  biopsy  sample,  who  derive  a  similar  level 
of  clinical  benefit  from  nivolumab  monotherapy,  although  using 
PD-1  expression  to  select  therapy  remains  problematic  as  some 
patients  whose  melanoma  has  no  detectable  PD-1  expression  can 
still respond to immunotherapy.

T-cell  checkpoint  antibodies  can  also  interfere  with  normal 
immune regulatory mechanisms, which may produce a novel spec-
trum  of  side  effects.  The  most  common  immune-related  adverse 
events were skin rash and diarrhea (sometimes severe, life-threatening  
colitis),  but  toxicity  can  involve  almost  any  organ  (e.g.,  thyroid-
itis,  hypophysitis,  hepatitis,  nephritis,  pneumonitis,  myocarditis, 
neuritis).  The  severity  and  frequency  of  toxicity  are  greatest  with 
combination T-cell checkpoint antibody therapy, followed by anti-
CTLA-4  and  then  anti-PD-1  monotherapies.  Vigilance,  interrup-
tion  of  therapy,  and  early  intervention  with  steroids  or  other 
immunosuppressive  agents,  such  as  anti–tumor  necrosis  factor 
antibodies or mycophenolate mofetil, can mitigate toxicity and pre-
vent permanent organ damage. The management of drug-induced 
toxicity with immunosuppressive agents does not appear to inter-
fere with antitumor activity, and benefit is manifest even in patients 
who have to discontinue immunotherapy due to immune-mediated 
toxicity. The use of T-cell checkpoint antibodies for metastatic mel-
anoma  has  become  commonplace,  but  there  is  controversy  about 
whether  all  patients  need  combined  anti-CTLA-4  and  anti-PD-1, 
whether biomarkers can be used to select patients who may benefit 

from  anti-PD-1  alone,  and  the  best  sequence  of  targeted  therapy 
and  immunotherapy  in  patients  whose  melanomas  have  a  BRAF 
mutation.  There  is  also  a  significant  economic  impact  with  any 
anticancer  therapy,  which  must  be  placed  in  the  context  of  the 
survival benefit.

TARGETED THERAPY
The  RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK  pathway  delivers  proliferation  and  sur-
vival  signals  from  the  cell  surface  to  the  cytoplasm  and  nucleus 
and is mutated in approximately 50% of melanomas. Inhibitors of 
BRAF and MEK can induce regression of melanomas that harbor a 
BRAF mutation. Three BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, 
and encorafenib, have been approved for the treatment of patients 
whose  stage  IV  melanomas  harbor  a  mutation  at  position  600  in 
BRAF.  Monotherapy  with  BRAF  inhibitors  has  been  supplanted 
with  combined  BRAF  and  MEK  inhibition  to  address  the  rapid 
adaptation  of  the  majority  of  melanomas  that  use  MAP  kinase 
pathway reactivation to facilitate growth when BRAF is inhibited. 
Combined therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib and 
trametinib, vemurafenib with cobimetinib, or encorafenib and bin-
imetinib) improved progression-free and overall survival compared 
to monotherapy with a BRAF inhibitor. Long-term results of inhibi-
tion of the MAP kinase pathway confirm that some patients achieve 
long  intervals  of  disease  control,  yet  the  major  limitation  of  both 
monotherapy and combined therapy appears to be the acquisition 
of resistance; the majority of patients relapse and eventually die. The 
mechanisms of resistance are diverse and reflect the genomic het-
erogeneity of melanoma; however, most instances involve reactiva-
tion of the MAPK pathway, often through RAS mutations or mutant 
BRAF amplification. Patients who develop resistance to BRAF and 
MEK inhibition are candidates for immunotherapy or clinical trials.
Targeted therapy is accompanied by manageable side effects that 
differ  from  those  experienced  during  immunotherapy  or  chemo-
therapy. A class-specific side effect of BRAF inhibitor monotherapy 
is the development of hyperproliferative skin lesions, some of which 
are well-differentiated squamous cell skin cancers (SCCs) occurring 
in up to 25% of patients. Paradoxical activation of the MAP kinase 
pathway occurs from BRAF inhibitor–mediated changes in BRAF 
wild-type  cells,  and  the  activation  is  blocked  by  MEK  inhibitor, 
which explains why these lesions occur much less frequently during 
combined therapy. Metastases of the treatment-induced SCCs have 
not been reported, and BRAF and MEK inhibitors can be continued 
safely  following  simple  excision  of  the  SCCs.  Cardiac  and  ocular 
toxicities,  although  infrequent,  can  occur  with  BRAF  and  MEK 
inhibitors and require medical evaluation, management, and usu-
ally discontinuation of targeted therapy.

Activating  mutations  in  the  c-kit  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  are 
found in a minority of cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun dam-
age  but  are  more  common  in  mucosal  and  acral  lentiginous  sub-
types. Overall, the number of patients with c-kit mutations is small, 
but when present, they are similar to those found in gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors and melanomas with activating c-kit mutations and 
can have clinically meaningful responses to imatinib. The probabil-
ity of objective response in patients whose melanomas harbor a c-kit 
mutation is 29%. N-RAS mutations occur in 15–20% of melanomas. 
At present, there are no effective targeted agents for these patients, 
but N-RAS inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials.

Other  systemic  therapies  used  to  treat  stage  IV  melanoma 
patients  include  high-dose  interleukin  2,  which  is  also  associated 
with durable remissions in some patients. Chemotherapy with dac-
arbazine or taxanes is infrequently used, and clinical trials remain 
an important option for patients with advanced melanoma. 

INITIAL APPROACH TO PATIENT WITH METASTATIC 
DISEASE
Upon diagnosis of stage IV disease, a sample of the patient’s tumor 
should be submitted for molecular testing to determine whether a 
BRAF or  c-kit mutation is present. Analysis of a metastatic lesion 
biopsy (if possible) is preferred, but any sample will suffice because 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   585

586

there is little discordance between primary and metastatic lesions. 
Treatment algorithms start with the tumor’s BRAF status. For BRAF 
wild-type  tumors,  immunotherapy  is  recommended.  For  patients 
whose tumors harbor a BRAF mutation, initial therapy with either 
combination  BRAF  and  MEK  inhibitors  or  immunotherapy  is 
acceptable.  Combined  therapy  with  BRAF  and  MEK  inhibitors  is 
recommended for patients with rapidly growing and symptomatic 
disease when a BRAF mutation is present. The sequence of immu-
notherapy  and  targeted  therapy  that  confers  the  greatest  survival 
benefit  in  patients  with  minimally  symptomatic  melanoma  is  not 
yet known, but ongoing randomized phase III trials should answer 
this  important  question.  Despite  improvements  in  therapy,  the 
majority of patients with metastatic melanoma will not be cured, so 
enrollment in a clinical trial is always an important consideration, 
even for previously untreated patients.

Clinical  trials  should  be  considered  for  patients  with  stage  IV 
disease who experience tumor progression despite current therapy. 
Many  will  be  poor  candidates  for  therapy  because  of  extensive 
disease  burden,  poor  performance  status,  or  concomitant  illness; 
thus, the timely integration of palliative care and hospice remains 
an important element of care. 
FOLLOW-UP
Skin examination and surveillance at least once a year are recom-
mended for all patients with melanoma. Routine blood work and 
imaging for patients with stage IA–IIA disease is not recommended 
unless symptoms are present. Surveillance diagnostic imaging can 
be  considered  in  patients  with  stage  III  high-risk  disease  but  is 
mainly reserved for patients with signs or symptoms of recurrent 
disease or to follow response to therapy. For stage-specific recom-
mendations,  please  consult  the  NCCN  guidelines  (see  “Further 
Reading”).

NONMELANOMA SKIN CANCERS
NMSCs  (mostly  SCCs  and  basal  cell  cancer  [BCC])  are  the  most 
common  cancers  in  the  United  States.  Although  tumor  registries  do 
not routinely gather data on the incidence of NMSCs, it is estimated 
that the annual incidence is more than 5.3 million cases in the United 
States; SCCs and BCCs account for 80% and 18%, respectively. While 
less common, the incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has tri-
pled over the past 20 years. There are now an estimated 1600 cases per 
year  with  an  annual  increase  in  incidence  of  8%.  While  all  forms  of 
NMSCs can metastasize, MCCs do this most commonly, with sentinel 
lymph  node  positivity  rates  of  25%  (compared  to  12–19%  for  mela-
noma) and mortality rates approaching 33% at 3 years. SCCs, partic-
ularly those with high-risk features, can also metastasize and account 
for 2400 deaths annually.

Similar  to  melanoma,  the  most  significant  cause  of  NMSCs  is  UVR, 
with  a  dose-response  relationship  between  tanning  bed  use  and  the 
incidence of NMSC. As few as four tanning bed visits per year confers 
a 15% increase in BCC and an 11% increase in SCC. The risk of lip or 
oral SCC is increased with cigarette smoking and, like SCC of the ear, 
has a worse prognosis than that seen on other body sites. Human papil-
lomaviruses and UVR may act as co-carcinogens. Inherited disorders 
of DNA repair, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, are associated with 
a greatly increased incidence of skin cancer and help to establish the 
link between UV-induced DNA damage, inadequate DNA repair, and 
skin cancer.

The  genes  damaged  most  commonly  by  UV  in  SCC  include  p53 
and  N-RAS,  whereas  BCC  is  associated  with  damage  to  hedgehog 
signaling  pathway  (Hh)  genes,  which  lead  to  basal  cell  proliferation. 
This is usually the result of loss of function of the tumor-suppressor 
patched  homolog  1  (PTCH1),  which  normally  inhibits  the  signaling 
of smoothened homolog (SMO). Two oral SMO inhibitors, vismode-
gib and sonidegib, have been approved by the FDA to treat advanced 
inoperable  or  metastatic  BCC  and  locally  advanced  BCC  that  has 
recurred  following  surgery  or  radiotherapy,  respectively.  Vismodegib 

also  reduces  the  incidence  of  BCC  in  patients  with  basal  cell  nevus 
syndrome  who  have  PTCH1  mutations,  affirming  the  importance  of 
Hh in the onset of BCC.

Immunosuppression has also been associated with the development 
of  NMSCs;  chronically  immunosuppressed  solid  organ  transplant 
recipients  have  a  65-fold  increase  in  SCC  and  a  10-fold  increase  in 
BCC.  The  frequency  of  skin  cancer  is  proportional  to  the  level  and 
duration of immunosuppression and the extent of sun exposure before 
and  after  transplantation.  SCCs  in  this  population  are  particularly 
aggressive,  demonstrating  higher  rates  of  local  recurrence,  metasta-
sis,  and  mortality.  Tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  antagonist  therapy 
of  inflammatory  bowel  disease  and  autoimmune  disorders,  such  as 
rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, may also confer an increased risk 
of NMSC.

Other  risk  factors  for  NMSCs  include  HIV  infection,  ionizing 
radiation,  thermal  burn  scars,  BRAF  inhibitor  monotherapy,  and 
chronic  ulcerations.  Albinism,  xeroderma  pigmentosum,  Muir-Torre 
syndrome, Rombo’s syndrome, Bazex-Dupré-Christol syndrome, dys-
keratosis congenita, and basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) 
also increase the incidence of NMSC.

Although  MCC  is  also  clearly  related  to  UV  exposure,  age,  and 
immunosuppression, this neural crest–derived cancer also appears to 
have a viral etiology; an oncogenic Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) 
is present in 80% of tumors. In patients with MCPyV-positive tumors, 
there  is  inactivation  of  tumor-suppressor  genes,  specifically  the  p53 
transcription factor and retinoblastoma protein (Rb). In addition, the 
viral  large  T  antigen  is  expressed  on  tumor  cells,  and  many  patients 
have  detectable  cellular  or  humoral  immune  responses  to  polyoma 
viral proteins, although this immune response is insufficient to eradi-
cate the malignancy.
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Basal  Cell  Carcinoma  BCC  arises  from  epidermal  basal  cells. 
The least invasive of BCC subtypes, superficial BCC, consists of often 
subtle, erythematous scaling plaques that slowly enlarge and are most 
commonly  seen  on  the  trunk  and  proximal  extremities  (Fig.  76-4). 
This subtype may be confused with benign inflammatory dermatoses, 
especially  nummular  eczema  and  psoriasis  or  premalignant  actinic 
keratoses.  BCC  also  can  present  as  a  small,  slowly  growing,  pearly 
nodule, often with tortuous telangiectatic vessels on its surface, rolled 
borders, and a central crust (nodular BCC). The occasional presence of 
melanin in this variant of nodular BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead to 
confusion with melanoma. Morpheaform (fibrosing), infiltrative, and 
micronodular BCC, the most invasive and potentially aggressive sub-
types, manifest as solitary, flat or slightly depressed, indurated whitish, 
yellowish,  or  pink  scar-like  plaques.  Borders  are  typically  indistinct, 
and  lesions  can  be  subtle;  thus,  delay  in  treatment  is  common,  and 
tumors  can  be  more  extensive  than  expected  clinically.  An  archaic 
name for this tumor is “rodent ulcer.”

Squamous  Cell  Carcinoma  Primary  cutaneous  SCC  is  a  malig-
nant neoplasm of keratinizing epidermal cells that has a variable clini-
cal course, ranging from indolent to rapid growth, with the potential to 
metastasize to regional and distant sites. Commonly, SCC appears as an 
ulcerated erythematous nodule or superficial erosion on sun-exposed 
skin of the head, neck, trunk, and extremities (Fig. 76-5). It may also 
appear as a banal, firm, dome-shaped papule or rough textured plaque. 
It is commonly mistaken for a wart or callous when the inflammatory 
response to the lesion is minimal. Dotted or coiled vessels are a hall-
mark of SCC when viewed through a dermatoscope. The margins of 
this  tumor  may  be  ill  defined,  and  fixation  to  underlying  structures 
may occur (“tethering”).

A very rapidly growing low-grade form of SCC, called keratoacan-
thoma (KA), typically appears as a large dome-shaped papule with a 
central keratotic crater. Some KAs regress spontaneously without ther-
apy, but because progression to metastatic SCC has been documented, 
KAs should be treated in the same manner as other types of cutaneous 
SCC. KAs occur in 15–25% of patients receiving monotherapy with a 
BRAF inhibitor.

Actinic  keratoses  and  cheilitis  (actinic  keratoses  on  the  lip),  both 
premalignant  forms  of  SCC,  present  as  hyperkeratotic  papules  on 
sun-exposed  areas.  Malignant  transformation  occurs  in  0.25–20% 
of  untreated  lesions.  SCC  in  situ,  also  called  Bowen’s  disease,  is  the 
intraepidermal form of SCC and usually presents as a scaling, eryth-
ematous plaque. SCC in situ most commonly arises on sun-damaged 
skin but can occur anywhere on the body. Bowen’s disease occurring 
secondary  to  infection  with  human  papillomavirus  can  arise  on  skin 

with minimal or no prior sun exposure, such as the buttock or poste-
rior thigh. Treatment of premalignant and in situ lesions reduces the 
subsequent risk of invasive disease.

Merkel  Cell  Carcinoma  MCC,  also  known  as  cutaneous  apu-
doma, primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, primary small 
cell carcinoma of the skin, and trabecular carcinoma of the skin, arises 
from  Merkel  cells,  which  are  neuroendocrine  skin  cells  that  act  as

pressure  receptors.  Like  other  skin  cancers,  MCCs  most  commonly 
arise  as  visible  skin  lesions,  usually  as  raised,  flesh-colored  nodules 
or masses; they can also be red or blue in color and vary in size from  
0. 5 to >5 cm in diameter and may enlarge rapidly. Although MCCs 
may  arise  almost  anywhere  on  the  body,  they  are  most  commonly 
found  in  sun-exposed  areas  such  as  the  head,  neck,  or  extremities. 
They can also be found around the anus and on eyelids. The common 
clinical features of MCC can be summarized by the acronym AEIOU: 
asymptomatic/nontender, expand rapidly, immune suppression, older 
than 50 years, and ultraviolet-exposed site.
 ■ NATURAL HISTORY
Basal  Cell  Carcinoma  The  natural  history  of  BCC  is  that  of 
a  slowly  enlarging,  locally  invasive  neoplasm.  The  degree  of  local 
destruction and risk of recurrence vary with the size, duration, loca-
tion, and histologic subtype of the tumor. Location on the central face, 
ears,  or  scalp  may  portend  a  higher  risk.  Small  nodular,  pigmented, 
cystic,  or  superficial  BCCs  respond  well  to  most  treatments.  Large 
lesions and micronodular, infiltrative, and morpheaform subtypes may 
be more aggressive. The metastatic potential of BCC is low (0.1%) in 
immunocompetent  patients,  but  the  risk  of  recurrence  or  a  new  pri-
mary NMSC is about 40% over 5 years.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma  The natural history of SCC depends 
on  tumor  and  host  characteristics.  Tumors  arising  on  sun-damaged 
skin  have  a  lower  metastatic  potential  than  do  those  on  non-sun-
exposed areas. Cutaneous SCC metastasizes in 0.3–5.2% of individuals, 
most  frequently  to  regional  lymph  nodes.  Tumors  occurring  on  the 
lower lip and ear develop regional metastases in 13 and 11% of patients, 
respectively, whereas the metastatic potential of SCC arising in scars, 
chronic ulcerations, and genital or mucosal surfaces is higher. Recur-
rent  SCC  has  a  30%  probability  for  metastatic  spread.  Large,  poorly 
differentiated,  deep  tumors  with  perineural  or  lymphatic  invasion, 
multifocal  tumors,  and  those  arising  in  immunosuppressed  patients 
often behave aggressively.

Merkel  Cell  Carcinoma  MCCs  have  clinical  features  of  both 
skin cancers and neuroendocrine tumors (particularly small cell lung 
cancer [SCLC]); thus, they can present locally and develop spread to 
lymph nodes and distant sites. Molecular markers of neuroendocrine 
origin such as synaptophysin or chromogranin A are useful to diagnose 
MCC. Unlike other neuroendocrine tumors, MCCs are not associated 
with measurable hormone secretion or endocrine syndromes.

Survival with MCC depends on extent of disease: 90% of patients with 
local disease are cured, whereas 52% with nodal involvement and 10% 
with distant disease survive. MCC has its own tumor-node-metastasis 
(TNM) staging system, which incorporates tumor size (<2 cm vs. >2 cm), 
nodal status (which can be determined by SLNB for clinically negative 
nodes), and the presence of distant metastases.

Independent of stage, the prognosis of MCC is improved if the tumor 
cells  contain  virus,  RB  protein  expression,  and  intratumoral  CD8+  T 
lymphocyte infiltration, whereas p63 expression, lymphovascular infil-
trative  pattern,  and  the  presence  of  immunosuppression  (e.g.,  organ 
transplant, HIV infection, certain cancers) portend a worse prognosis.

TREATMENT
Basal Cell, Squamous Cell, and Merkle Cell 
Carcinoma 

BASAL CELL CARCINOMA
Treatment  for  BCC  includes  electrodesiccation  and  curettage 
(ED&C), excision, cryosurgery, radiation therapy (RT), laser ther-
apy,  Mohs  micrographic  surgery  (MMS),  topical  5-fluorouracil, 
photodynamic  therapy  (PDT),  and  topical  immunomodulators, 
such  as  imiquimod.  The  choice  of  therapy  depends  on  tumor 
characteristics  including  depth  and  location,  patient  age,  medical 
status, and patient preference. ED&C remains the most commonly 
employed  treatment  for  superficial,  minimally  invasive  nodular 

BCCs and low-risk tumors (e.g., a small tumor of a less aggressive 
subtype in a favorable location). Wide local excision with standard 
margins  is  usually  selected  for  invasive,  ill-defined,  and  more 
aggressive  subtypes  of  tumors  or  for  cosmetic  reasons.  MMS,  a 
specialized type of surgical excision that provides the best method 
for tumor removal while preserving uninvolved tissue, is associated 
with cure rates >98%. It is the preferred modality for lesions that are 
recurrent, in high-risk or cosmetically sensitive locations (including 
recurrent tumors in these locations), and for which maximal tissue 
conservation is critical (e.g., the eyelids, lips, ears, nose, and digits). 
RT can cure patients not considered surgical candidates and can be 
used as a surgical adjunct in high-risk tumors. Imiquimod can be 
used  to  treat  superficial  and  smaller  nodular  BCCs,  although  it  is 
not FDA approved for nodular BCC. Topical 5-fluorouracil therapy 
should  be  limited  to  superficial  BCC.  PDT,  which  uses  selective 
activation  of  a  photoactive  drug  by  visible  light,  has  been  used  in 
patients with numerous tumors. Intralesional therapy (5-fluorouracil 
or  IFN)  can  also  be  employed.  Like  RT,  it  remains  an  option  for 
selected  patients  who  cannot  or  will  not  undergo  surgery.  Sys-
temic therapy with an SMO inhibitor, vismodegib or sonidegib, is 
indicated  for  patients  with  metastatic  or  advanced  BCC  that  has 
recurred  after  local  therapy  and  who  are  not  candidates  for  sur-
gery or RT. Targeted therapy with SMO antagonists does not cure 
patients with BCC but induces regression in approximately 50% of 
patients with a median duration of response >9 months. 
SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
The  principles  for  surgical  management  of  SCC  are  the  same  as 
for  BCC.  Previously,  advanced  disease  was  treated  with  cisplatin- 
containing  chemotherapy,  intralesional  5-fluorouracil,  or  cetux-
imab.  These  regimens  have  been  supplanted  by  cemiplimab,  a 
monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1, which causes tumor regres-
sion in 47% of patients with advanced disease. SCC and KAs that 
develop  in  patients  receiving  BRAF-targeted  therapy  should  be 
excised, after which BRAF therapy can be continued. 
MERKEL CELL CARCINOMA
The epidemiology, clinical features, and treatments for MCC over-
lap  those  for  melanoma  and  NMSC.  Early-stage  MCCs  may  be 
cured with wide local excision of the primary tumor and nodal stag-
ing with SLNB. Like SCLCs, MCC is sensitive to radiation, PD-1-
directed immunotherapy, and platinum-based chemotherapy. RT is 
often  used  as  postoperative  adjuvant  therapy  at  both  the  primary 
excision and SLNB sites, although its use may be withheld around 
sensitive  areas  such  as  the  eyelids  and  hands  and  after  a  negative 
SLNB. For nonsensitive areas, RT may allow for primary excision 
margins  smaller  than  the  traditionally  recommended  2-cm  radial 
margins. Similar to melanoma, completion node dissection is now 
uncommonly used for a positive sentinel node. Adjuvant RT, close 
observation, and clinical trials investigating immunotherapy based 
on anti-PD-1 agents are favored.

For  patients  with  metastatic  disease,  immunotherapy  has  sup-
planted  chemotherapy.  Avelumab  (anti-PD-L1)  therapy  led  to 
objective responses in 33% of patients with advanced MCC; 82% of 
the responses were durable.

Follow-up of patients with MCC is based on stage and risk. Rou-
tine skin exams by a dermatologist familiar with MCC and regular 
examinations of the nodal basins are recommended. A serum titer 
of  monoclonal  antibody  to  MCPyV  should  be  obtained  in  newly 
diagnosed MCC patients. The test can be used to follow patients for 
relapse if the titer is elevated at baseline and returns to normal after 
treatment.  Conversely,  if  the  titer  is  elevated  but  does  not  return 
to normal after treatment, imaging should be obtained to look for 
occult metastases.

 ■ PREVENTION
The principles for prevention are those described for melanoma earlier. 
Unique  strategies  for  NMSC  include  active  surveillance  for  patients 
on  immunosuppressive  medications  or  BRAF-targeted  therapy.

Chemoprophylaxis using synthetic retinoids and immunosuppression 
reduction when possible may be useful in controlling new lesions and 
managing  patients  with  multiple  tumors.  Field  therapy  with  topical 
5-fluorouracil,  ingenol  mebutate,  or  imiquimod  can  reduce  transfor-
mation to SCC in patients with severely sun-damaged skin and numer-
ous premalignant actinic keratoses. Older, immunosuppressed patients 
should  be  managed  with  the  lowest  doses  of  immunosuppression 
possible  and  encouraged  to  be  particularly  careful  to  minimize  UV 
exposure. Earlier biopsy of unusual-appearing skin lesions may lead to 
better control of aggressive lesions.
 ■ OTHER NONMELANOMA CUTANEOUS 
MALIGNANCIES
Neoplasms of cutaneous adnexae and sarcomas of fibrous, mesenchy-
mal, fatty, and vascular tissues make up the remaining 1–2% of NMSCs 
(Fig. 76-6). Lymphomas of B- or T-cell origin can also manifest in the 
skin and can mimic benign conditions such as psoriasis and eczema.

Extramammary  Paget’s  disease  is  an  uncommon  apocrine  malig-
nancy arising from stem cells of the epidermis that is characterized his-
tologically by the presence of Paget cells. These tumors present as moist 
erythematous patches on anogenital or axillary skin of the elderly.

Outcomes  are  generally  good  with  surgery,  and  5-year  disease- 
specific  survival  is  95%  with  localized  disease.  Advanced  age  and 
extensive disease at presentation confer poorer prognosis. RT or top-
ical  imiquimod  can  be  considered  for  more  extensive  disease.  Local 
management may be challenging because these tumors often extend far 
beyond clinical margins; surgical excision with MMS has the highest 
cure rates. Similarly, MMS is the treatment of choice in other rare cuta-
neous tumors with extensive subclinical extension such as dermatofi-
brosarcoma protuberans.

Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a soft tissue sarcoma of vascular origin that 
is induced by the human herpesvirus 8. The incidence of KS increased 

dramatically during the AIDS epidemic, but has now decreased tenfold 
with the institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

77 Head and Neck Cancer

Everett E. Vokes

Epithelial  carcinomas  of  the  head  and  neck  arise  from  the  mucosal 
surfaces in the head and neck and typically are squamous cell in origin. 
This category includes tumors of the paranasal sinuses, the oral cavity, 
and the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Tumors 
of the salivary glands differ from the more common carcinomas of the 
head  and  neck  in  etiology,  histopathology,  clinical  presentation,  and 
therapy. They are rare and histologically highly heterogeneous. Thyroid 
malignancies are described in Chap. 385.

 ■ INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
The number of new cases of head and neck cancers (oral cavity, phar-
ynx, and larynx) in the United States was estimated at 65,630 in 2020, 
accounting for about 4% of adult malignancies; estimated deaths were 
14,500.  The  worldwide  incidence  exceeds  half  a  million  cases  annu-
ally. In North America and Europe, the tumors usually arise from the 
oral  cavity,  oropharynx,  or  larynx.  The  incidence  of  oropharyngeal 
cancers is increasing in recent years, especially in Western countries. 
Nasopharyngeal cancer is more commonly seen in the Mediterranean 
countries and in the Far East, where it is endemic in some areas.

 ■ ETIOLOGY AND GENETICS
Alcohol and  tobacco use  are  the most  significant environmental risk 
factors  for  head  and  neck  cancer,  and  when  used  together,  they  act 
synergistically.  Smokeless  tobacco  is  an  etiologic  agent  for  oral  can-
cers. Other potential carcinogens include marijuana and occupational 
exposures  such  as  nickel  refining,  exposure  to  textile  fibers,  and 
woodworking.

Some head and neck cancers have a viral etiology. Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) infection is frequently associated with nasopharyngeal cancer, 
especially  in  endemic  areas  of  the  Mediterranean  and  Far  East.  EBV 
antibody  titers  can  be  measured  to  screen  high-risk  populations  and 
are  under  investigation  to  monitor  treatment  response.  Nasopharyn-
geal  cancer  has  also  been  associated  with  consumption  of  salted  fish 
and indoor pollution.

In  Western  countries,  the  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  is  associ-
ated  with  a  rising  incidence  of  tumors  arising  from  the  oropharynx, 
that  is,  the  tonsillar  bed  and  base  of  tongue.  Over  50%  of  orophar-
yngeal tumors are caused by HPV in the United States, and in many 
urban centers, this proportion is higher. HPV 16 is the dominant viral 
subtype, although HPV 18 and other oncogenic subtypes are seen as 
well.  Alcohol-  and  tobacco-related  cancers,  on  the  other  hand,  have 
decreased in incidence. HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer frequently 
occurs in a younger patient population and is associated with increased 
numbers of sexual partners and oral sexual practices. It is associated 
with  a  better  prognosis,  especially  for  nonsmokers.  Vaccination  with 
the  nine-valent  HPV  vaccine  may  prevent  the  disease  in  high-risk 
populations.

Dietary  factors  may  contribute.  The  incidence  of  head  and  neck 
cancer is higher in people with the lowest consumption of fruits and 
vegetables. Certain vitamins, including carotenoids, may be protective 
if  included  in  a  balanced  diet.  Supplements  of  retinoids,  such  as  cis- 
retinoic acid, have not been shown to prevent head and neck cancers 
(or lung cancer) and may increase the risk in active smokers. No spe-
cific risk factors or environmental carcinogens have been identified for 
salivary gland tumors.

 ■ HISTOPATHOLOGY, CARCINOGENESIS, AND 
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Squamous  cell  head  and  neck  cancers  are  divided  into  well- 
differentiated,  moderately  well-differentiated,  and  poorly  differenti-
ated  categories.  Poorly  differentiated  tumors  have  a  worse  prognosis 
than well-differentiated tumors. For nasopharyngeal cancers, the less 

common differentiated squamous cell carcinoma is distinguished from 
nonkeratinizing and undifferentiated carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma) 
that  contains  infiltrating  lymphocytes  and  is  commonly  associated 
with EBV.

Salivary gland tumors can arise from the major (parotid, subman-
dibular, sublingual) or minor salivary glands (located in the submucosa 
of the upper aerodigestive tract). Most parotid tumors are benign, but 
half  of  submandibular  and  sublingual  gland  tumors  and  most  minor 
salivary gland tumors are malignant. Malignant tumors include muco-
epidermoid and adenoid cystic carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.

The  mucosal  surface  of  the  entire  pharynx  is  exposed  to  alcohol- 
and  tobacco-related  carcinogens  and  is  at  risk  for  the  development 
of  a  premalignant  or  malignant  lesion.  Erythroplakia  (a  red  patch) 
or  leukoplakia  (a  white  patch)  can  be  histopathologically  classified 
as  hyperplasia,  dysplasia,  carcinoma  in  situ,  or  carcinoma.  However, 
most head and neck cancer patients do not present with a known his-
tory of premalignant lesions. Multiple synchronous or metachronous 
cancers can also be observed. In fact, over time, patients with treated 
early-stage  tobacco-  and  alcohol-related  head  and  neck  cancer  are  at 
greater risk of dying from a second malignancy than from a recurrence 
of the primary disease.

Second head and neck malignancies are usually not therapy induced; 
they  reflect  the  exposure  of  the  upper  aerodigestive  mucosa  to  the 
same  carcinogens  that  caused  the  first  cancer.  These  second  prima-
ries  develop  in  the  head  and  neck  area,  the  lung,  or  the  esophagus. 
Thus, computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer in heavy 
smokers who have already developed a head and neck cancer is rec-
ommended. Rarely, patients can develop a radiation therapy–induced 
sarcoma  after  having  undergone  prior  radiotherapy  for  a  head  and 
neck cancer.

Much progress has been made in describing the molecular features 
of  head  and  neck  cancer.  These  features  have  allowed  investigators 
to describe the genetic and epigenetic alterations and the mutational 
spectrum of these tumors. Early reports demonstrated frequent overex-
pression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Overexpres-
sion was shown to correlate with poor prognosis. However, it has not 
proved to be a good predictor of tumor response to EGFR inhibitors, 
which  are  active  in  only  about  10–15%  of  patients  as  single  agents. 
Complex  genetic  analyses,  including  those  by  The  Cancer  Genome 
Atlas  project,  have  been  performed.  p53  mutations  are  found  fre-
quently with other major affected oncogenic driver pathways including 
the mitotic signaling and Notch pathways and cell cycle regulation in 
HPV-negative tumors. HPV oncogenes act through direct inhibition of 
the p53 and RB tumor-suppressor genes, thereby initiating the carcino-
genic process. HRAS appears to be emerging as a potentially targetable 
mutation  in  a  small  patient  subset.  While  overall  mutation  rates  are 
similar in HPV-positive and carcinogen-induced tumors, the specific 
mutational  signature  of  HPV-positive  tumors  differs,  with  frequent 
alteration  of  the  PI3K  pathway  and  occasional  mutations  in  KRAS. 
Overall,  these  alterations  affect  mitogenic  signaling,  genetic  stability, 
cellular proliferation, and differentiation.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIFFERENTIAL 
DIAGNOSIS
Most  tobacco-related  head  and  neck  cancers  occur  in  patients  older 
than age 60 years. HPV-related malignancies are frequently diagnosed 
in  younger  patients,  usually  in  their  forties  or  fifties,  whereas  EBV- 
related nasopharyngeal cancer can occur at all ages, including in teen-
agers. The manifestations vary according to the stage and primary site 
of the tumor. Patients with nonspecific signs and symptoms in the head 
and  neck  area  should  be  evaluated  with  a  thorough  otolaryngologic 
examination, particularly if symptoms persist longer than 2–4 weeks. 
Males are more frequently affected than women by head and neck can-
cers, including HPV-positive tumors.

Cancer of the nasopharynx typically does not cause early symptoms. 
However, it may cause unilateral serous otitis media due to obstruction 
of  the  eustachian  tube,  unilateral  or  bilateral  nasal  obstruction,  or 
epistaxis. Advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma causes neuropathies of 
the cranial nerves due to skull base involvement.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyCarcinomas of the oral cavity present as nonhealing ulcers, changes 
in  the  fit  of  dentures,  or  painful  lesions  and  masses.  Tumors  of  the 
tongue base or oropharynx can cause decreased tongue mobility and 
alterations  in  speech.  Cancers  of  the  oropharynx  or  hypopharynx 
rarely  cause  early  symptoms,  but  they  may  cause  sore  throat  and/or 
otalgia. HPV-related tumors frequently present with neck lymphade-
nopathy as the first sign.

Hoarseness  may  be  an  early  symptom  of  laryngeal  cancer,  and 
persistent hoarseness requires referral to a specialist for indirect laryn-
goscopy and/or radiographic studies. If a head and neck lesion treated 
initially  with  antibiotics  does  not  resolve  in  a  short  period,  further 
workup is indicated; to simply continue the antibiotic treatment may 
be to lose the chance of early diagnosis of a malignancy.

Advanced head and neck cancers in any location can cause severe 
pain, otalgia, airway obstruction, cranial neuropathies, trismus, odyn-
ophagia, dysphagia, decreased tongue mobility, fistulas, skin involve-
ment, and massive cervical lymphadenopathy, which may be unilateral 
or  bilateral.  Some  patients  have  enlarged  lymph  nodes  even  though 
no  primary  lesion  can  be  detected  by  endoscopy  or  biopsy;  these 
patients  are  considered  to  have  carcinoma  of  unknown  primary  
(Fig. 77-1). Tonsillectomy and directed biopsies of the base of tongue 
can frequently identify a small primary tumor that frequently will be 
HPV related. If the enlarged nodes are located in the upper neck and 
the tumor cells are of squamous cell histology, the malignancy proba-
bly arose from a mucosal surface in the head or neck. Tumor cells in 
supraclavicular lymph nodes may also arise from a primary site in the 
chest or abdomen.

The  physical  examination  should  include  inspection  of  all  visible 
mucosal surfaces and palpation of the floor of the mouth and of the 
tongue  and  neck.  In  addition  to  tumors  themselves,  leukoplakia  (a 
white mucosal patch) or erythroplakia (a red mucosal patch) may be 
observed; these “premalignant” lesions can represent hyperplasia, dys-
plasia,  or  carcinoma  in  situ  and  require  biopsy.  Further  examination 
should  be  performed  by  a  specialist.  Additional  staging  procedures 
include CT or MRI of the head and neck to identify the extent of the 
disease. Patients with lymph node involvement should have CT scan 
of  the  chest  and  upper  abdomen  to  screen  for  distant  metastases.  In 
heavy smokers, the CT scan of the chest can also serve as a screening 
tool  to  rule  out  a  second  lung  primary  tumor.  A  positron  emission 
tomography (PET) scan can help to identify or exclude distant metas-
tases. CT and PET scans may also be useful in evaluating response to 
therapy. The definitive staging procedure is an endoscopic examination 
under  anesthesia,  which  may  include  laryngoscopy,  esophagoscopy,

and bronchoscopy; during this procedure, multiple biopsy samples are 
obtained to establish a primary diagnosis, define the extent of primary 
disease,  and  identify  any  additional  premalignant  lesions  or  second 
primaries.

Head and neck tumors are classified according to the tumor-node- 
metastasis (TNM) system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) (Fig. 77-2). This classification varies according to the specific 
anatomic subsite. In general, primary tumors are classified as T1 to T3 
by increasing size, whereas T4 usually represents invasion of another 
structure  such  as  bone,  muscle,  or  root  of  tongue.  Lymph  nodes  are 
staged  by  size,  number,  and  location  (ipsilateral  vs  contralateral  to 
the  primary).  Distant  metastases  are  found  in  <10%  of  patients  at 
initial  diagnosis  and  are  more  common  in  patients  with  advanced 
lymph  node  stage;  microscopic  involvement  of  the  lungs,  bones,  or 
liver  is  more  common,  particularly  in  patients  with  advanced  neck 
lymph  node  disease.  Modern  imaging  techniques  may  increase  the 
number of patients with clinically detectable distant metastases in the 
future.  HPV-related  oropharyngeal  malignancies  have  consistently 
been  shown  to  have  a  better  prognosis,  and  in  the  eighth  edition  of 
the  AJCC  staging  manual,  a  separate  staging  system  that  takes  into 
account the more favorable outlook of these patients will be included. 
According to this system, patients with advanced nodal stage can still 
be considered to have an overall early stage (and associated good prog-
nosis), especially if the patient is a nonsmoker or has limited lifelong 
tobacco exposure.

In  patients  with  lymph  node  involvement  and  no  visible  primary, 
the diagnosis should be made by lymph node excision (Fig. 77-1). If the 
results indicate squamous cell carcinoma, a panendoscopy should be per-
formed, with biopsy of all suspicious-appearing areas and directed biop-
sies of common primary sites, such as the nasopharynx, tonsil, tongue 
base, and pyriform sinus. HPV-positive tumors especially can have small 
primary tumors that spread early to locoregional lymph nodes.

TREATMENT
Head and Neck Cancer

Patients  with  head  and  neck  cancer  can  be  grossly  categorized 
into three clinical groups: those with localized disease, those with 
locally or regionally advanced disease (lymph node positive), and 
those  with  recurrent  and/or  metastatic  disease  below  the  neck. 
Comorbidities associated with tobacco and alcohol abuse can affect 
treatment outcome and define long-term risks for patients who are 
cured of their disease. 

LOCALIZED DISEASE
Nearly one-third of patients have localized disease, that is, T1 or T2 
(stage I or stage II) lesions without detectable lymph node involve-
ment or distant metastases. These patients are treated with curative 
intent by either surgery or radiation therapy. The choice of modality 
differs  according  to  anatomic  location  and  institutional  expertise. 
Radiation therapy is often preferred for laryngeal cancer to preserve 
voice function, and surgery is preferred for small lesions in the oral 
cavity  to  avoid  the  long-term  complications  of  radiation,  such  as 
xerostomia  and  osteoradionecrosis  and  dental  decay.  Randomized 
data have shown that a prophylactic staging neck dissection should 
be part of the surgical procedure to eliminate occult nodal metastatic 
disease. Overall 5-year survival is 60–90%. Most recurrences occur 
within the first 2 years following diagnosis and are usually local. 

LOCALLY OR REGIONALLY ADVANCED DISEASE
Locally or regionally advanced disease—disease with a large primary 
tumor and/or lymph node metastases—is the stage of presentation 
for >50% of patients. Such patients can also be treated with curative 
intent,  but  not  usually  with  surgery  or  radiation  therapy  alone. 
Combined-modality  therapy,  including  surgery  and/or  radiation 
therapy and chemotherapy, is most successful. Chemotherapy can 
be administered as induction chemotherapy (chemotherapy before 
surgery  and/or  radiotherapy)  or  as  concomitant  (simultaneous)

chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy.  The  latter  is  currently  most 
commonly  used  and  supported  by  the  best  evidence.  Five-year 
survival rates exceed 50% in many trials, but part of this increased 
survival may be due to an increasing fraction of study populations 
with HPV-related tumors who carry a better prognosis. HPV test-
ing  of  newly  diagnosed  tumors  should  be  performed  for  patients 
with oropharyngeal tumors at the time of diagnosis. Clinical trials 
for  HPV-related  tumors  are  focused  on  exploring  reductions  in 

treatment intensity, especially radiation dose, in order to ameliorate 
long-term toxicities (fibrosis, swallowing dysfunction).

In  patients  with  intermediate-stage  tumors  (stage  III  and  early 
stage  IV),  concomitant  chemoradiotherapy  can  be  administered 
as  a  primary  treatment  for  patients  with  unresectable  disease,  to 
pursue  an  organ-preserving  approach  especially  for  patients  with 
laryngeal cancer (omission of surgery), or in the postoperative set-
ting for smaller resectable tumors with adverse prognostic features.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyInduction  Chemotherapy 
In  this  strategy,  patients  receive  che-
motherapy (current standard is a three-drug regimen of docetaxel, 
cisplatin,  and  fluorouracil  [5-FU])  before  surgery  and  radiation 
therapy.  Most  patients  who  receive  three  cycles  show  tumor 
reduction, and the response is clinically “complete” in up to half of 
patients. This “sequential” multimodality therapy allows for organ 
preservation in patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer 
and results in higher cure rates compared with radiotherapy alone. 

Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy  With the concomitant strategy, 
chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy  are  given  simultaneously 
rather  than  in  sequence.  Tumor  recurrences  from  head  and  neck 
cancer  develop  most  commonly  locoregionally  (in  the  head  and 
neck area of the primary and draining lymph nodes). The concom-
itant approach is aimed at enhancing tumor cell killing by radiation 
therapy in the presence of chemotherapy (radiation enhancement) 
and is a conceptually attractive approach for bulky tumors. Toxicity 
(especially  mucositis,  grade  3  or  4,  in  70–80%)  is  increased  with 
concomitant  chemoradiotherapy.  However,  meta-analyses  of  ran-
domized trials document an improvement in 5-year survival of 8% 
with  concomitant  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy.  Cisplatin 
is preferentially given weekly during a course of daily radiotherapy 
over a 6- to 7-week course. In addition, concomitant chemoradio-
therapy produces better laryngectomy-free survival (organ preser-
vation)  than  radiation  therapy  alone  in  patients  with  advanced 
larynx cancer. The use of radiation therapy together with cisplatin 
produces  improved  survival  in  patients  with  advanced  nasophar-
yngeal  cancer.  The  outcome  of  HPV-related  cancers  seems  to  be 
especially  favorable  following  cisplatin-based  chemoradiotherapy. 
Trials substituting cisplatin with the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab in 
that patient population have shown inferior survival.

The success of concomitant chemoradiotherapy in patients with 
unresectable disease has led to the testing of a similar approach in 
patients  with  resected  intermediate-stage  disease  as  a  postopera-
tive  therapy.  Concomitant  chemoradiotherapy  produces  a  signifi-
cant  improvement  over  postoperative  radiation  therapy  alone  for 
patients  whose  tumors  demonstrate  higher  risk  features,  such  as 
extracapsular  spread  beyond  involved  lymph  nodes,  involvement 
of  multiple  lymph  nodes,  or  positive  margins  at  the  primary  site 
following surgery.

A  monoclonal  antibody  to  EGFR  (cetuximab)  increases  sur-
vival rates when administered during radiotherapy. EGFR blockade 
results in radiation sensitization and has milder systemic side effects 
than traditional chemotherapy agents, although an acneiform skin 
rash  is  commonly  observed.  Nevertheless,  the  addition  of  cetuxi-
mab  to  current  standard  chemoradiotherapy  regimens  has  failed 
to show further improvement in survival and is not recommended. 

TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR HPV-RELATED HEAD AND 
NECK CANCERS
Given  consistent  observations  of  high  survival  rates  for  patients 
with  advanced  HPV-related  oropharyngeal  tumors  using  com-
bined-modality  treatment  strategies,  de-escalation  protocols  have 
attracted  widespread  interest.  The  goal  here  is  to  decrease  the 
long-term  morbidity  resulting  from  high-dose  radiation  therapy, 
including extensive neck fibrosis, swallowing problems, and oste-
oradionecrosis of the jaw. Current studies are investigating the use 
of  lower  radiation  doses,  the  use  of  induction  chemotherapy  and 
subsequent  omission  of  chemotherapy  or  administration  of  sig-
nificantly reduced chemoradiation doses in very good responders, 
and other strategies. In addition, interest has increased in surgical 
approaches  using  robotic  surgery,  which  allows  better  visualiza-
tion  of  the  base  of  tongue  and  tonsil.  While  technically  feasible, 
this  approach  remains  investigational  because  a  large  number  of 
patients  with  disease  involving  multiple  lymph  nodes  will  still 
require  postoperative  chemoradiotherapy,  thus  negating  the  goal 
of  treatment  de-escalation.  It  is  expected  that  distinct  treatment 
guidelines from carcinogen-induced tumors will be defined in the 
coming years.

RECURRENT AND/OR METASTATIC DISEASE
Five to ten percent of patients present with metastatic disease, and 
30–50%  of  patients  with  locoregionally  advanced  disease  expe-
rience  recurrence,  frequently  outside  the  head  and  neck  region. 
Patients  with  recurrent  and/or  metastatic  disease  are,  with  few 
exceptions, treated with palliative intent. Some patients may require 
local  or  regional  radiation  therapy  for  pain  control,  but  most  are 
given systemic therapy.

Combination chemotherapy formerly was the first-line systemic 
therapeutic approach to patients with recurrent disease after prior 
curative intent surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy or those present-
ing initially with metastatic disease. In particular, a combination of 
cisplatin with 5-FU and cetuximab (the EXTREME regimen) was 
frequently used.

However,  immunotherapies  have  proven  to  be  of  value  in  this 
setting.  In  particular,  inhibitors  of  the  immunosuppressive  lym-
phocyte  surface  receptor  (PD-1)  pathway  have  shown  activity  in 
squamous  cell  cancers  of  the  head  and  neck.  A  randomized  trial 
evaluating the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus traditional chemo-
therapy in the second-line treatment of patients with recurrent or 
metastatic disease showed a significant increase in 1-year survival 
rates  with  fewer  severe  treatment-related  toxicities.  In  addition, 
some responses were of long duration, allowing a cohort of patients 
to  live  far  beyond  the  historical  median  of  <1  year.  The  PD-1 
inhibitor pembrolizumab also demonstrated activity in a similarly 
designed randomized trial.

Following establishment of second-line activity, pembrolizumab 
was compared as single-agent therapy or in combination with cis-
platin and 5-FU with prior standard chemotherapy alone (cisplatin, 
5-FU, and cetuximab). In this trial, overall survival was improved 
with  pembrolizumab  versus  chemotherapy  as  well  as  with  the 
combination  of  chemotherapy  plus  pembrolizumab.  No  statisti-
cally significant impact on progression-free survival was noted. In 
addition,  expression  of  PD-L1  in  the  tumor  tissue  was  shown  to 
be of importance. Patients with tumors high in expression (PD-L1 
score >20%; i.e., expression of PD-L1 on 20% of tumor cells) had 
a  marked  survival  benefit  with  pembrolizumab  as  single  agent, 
whereas patients with lower PD-L1 expression had a less impressive 
but  still  statistically  significant  survival  benefit.  However,  for  the 
group expressing lower levels of PD-L1, the combination of pem-
brolizumab  with  chemotherapy  showed  more  substantial  benefit. 
Current  standard  treatment  therefore  frequently  consists  of  com-
bination chemoimmunotherapy for patients with a low combined 
positive score (CPS; the fraction of tumor cells expressing PD-L1), 
whereas those with higher CPS scores can be treated with immuno-
therapy alone, especially if overall tumor burden is limited. Patients 
who experience progression after first-line chemoimmunotherapy 
or immunotherapy can then be treated with additional single-agent 
or combination chemotherapy.

EGFR-directed therapies, including monoclonal antibodies (e.g., 
cetuximab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR sig-
naling pathway (e.g., erlotinib or gefitinib), have single-agent activ-
ity  of  ∼10%.  Side  effects  are  usually  limited  to  an  acneiform  rash 
and diarrhea (for the TKIs). The addition of cetuximab to standard 
combination chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin and 5-FU 
results in a significant increase in median survival. Drugs targeting 
specific mutations are under investigation, and patients with HRAS 
mutations have tumor shrinkage with the farnesyltransferase inhib-
itor tipifarnib. 
COMPLICATIONS
Complications from treatment of head and neck cancer are usually 
correlated  to  the  extent  of  surgery  and  exposure  of  normal  tissue 
structures  to  radiation.  Currently,  the  extent  of  surgery  has  been 
limited  or  completely  replaced  by  chemotherapy  and  radiation 
therapy  as  the  primary  approach.  Acute  complications  of  radia-
tion  include  mucositis  and  dysphagia.  Long-term  complications 
include xerostomia, loss of taste, decreased tongue mobility, second 
malignancies,  dysphagia,  and  neck  fibrosis.  The  complications  of

chemotherapy vary with the regimen used but usually include mye-
losuppression, mucositis, nausea and vomiting, and nephrotoxicity 
(with cisplatin).

The  mucosal  side  effects  of  therapy  can  lead  to  malnutrition 
and  dehydration.  Many  centers  address  issues  of  dentition  before 
starting treatment, and some place feeding tubes to ensure control 
of  hydration  and  nutrition  intake.  About  50%  of  patients  develop 
hypothyroidism from the treatment; thus, thyroid function should 
be monitored.

 ■ SALIVARY GLAND TUMORS
Most benign salivary gland tumors are treated with surgical excision, 
and  patients  with  invasive  salivary  gland  tumors  are  treated  with 
surgery  and  radiation  therapy.  These  tumors  may  recur  regionally; 
adenoid  cystic  carcinoma  has  a  tendency  to  recur  along  the  nerve 
tracks.  Distant  metastases  may  occur  as  late  as  10–20  years  after  the 
initial diagnosis. For metastatic disease, therapy is given with palliative 
intent, usually chemotherapy with doxorubicin and/or cisplatin. Iden-
tification of novel agents with activity in these tumors is a high priority. 
It is hoped that comprehensive genomic characterization of these rare 
tumors will facilitate these efforts.

78 Neoplasms of the Lung

Leora Horn, Wade T. Iams

Lung  cancer,  which  was  rare  before  1900  with  fewer  than  400  cases 
described in the medical literature, is considered a disease of modern 
man,  killing  over  three  times  as  many  men  as  prostate  cancer  and 
nearly  twice  as  many  women  as  breast  cancer.  Although  lung  cancer 
remains the number one cause of cancer-related mortality, a decline in 
lung cancer deaths has emerged, attributed to improvements in testing 
and  therapeutic  strategies  and  a  decline  in  tobacco  usage.  Tobacco 
consumption  is  the  primary  cause  of  lung  cancer,  a  reality  firmly 

established in the mid-twentieth century and codified with the release 
of  the  U.S.  Surgeon  General’s  1964  report  on  the  health  effects  of 
tobacco smoking. Following the report, cigarette use started to decline 
in North America and parts of Europe, and with it, so did the incidence 
of lung cancer. Although tobacco smoking remains the primary cause 
of lung cancer worldwide, approximately 60% of new lung cancers in 
the United States occur in former smokers (smoked ≥100 cigarettes per 
lifetime, quit ≥1 year), many of whom quit decades ago, or never smok-
ers (smoked <100 cigarettes per lifetime). Moreover, one in five women 
and one in 12 men diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Lung  cancer  is  the  most  common  cause  of  cancer  death  among  
American  men  and  women.  Approximately  228,000  individuals  will 
be  diagnosed  with  lung  cancer  in  the  United  States  in  2020,  and  
>135, 000 individuals will die from the disease. Lung cancer is uncom-
mon below age 40, with rates increasing until age 80, after which the rate 
tapers off. The projected lifetime probability of developing lung cancer 
is estimated to be ∼8% among males and ∼6% among females. The inci-
dence of lung cancer varies by racial and ethnic group, with the highest 
age-adjusted incidence rates among African Americans. The excess in 
age-adjusted rates among African Americans occurs only among men, 
but examinations of age-specific rates show that below age 50, mortal-
ity  from  lung  cancer  is  >25%  higher  among  African  American  than  
Caucasian women. Incidence and mortality rates among Hispanics and 
Native and Asian Americans are ∼40–50% those of whites.

 ■ RISK FACTORS
Cigarette smokers have a 10-fold or greater increased risk of developing 
lung cancer compared to those who have never smoked. A large-scale 
genomic study suggested that one genetic mutation is induced for every 
15 cigarettes smoked. The risk of lung cancer is lower among persons 
who quit smoking than among those who continue smoking. The size 
of the lung cancer risk reduction increases with the length of time the 
person  has  quit  smoking,  although  even  long-term  former  smokers 
have higher risks of lung cancer than those who never smoked. Cig-
arette smoking has been shown to increase the risk of all major types 
of lung cancer. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or second-hand 
smoke is also an established cause of lung cancer. The risk from ETS 
is  less  than  from  active  smoking,  with  about  a  20–30%  increase  in 
lung  cancer  observed  among  never  smokers  married  for  many  years 
to  smokers,  in  comparison  to  the  2000%  increase  among  continuing 
active smokers. The impact on the development of lung cancer among 
users of alternate nicotine delivery devices (e-cigarettes or vaping) is 
undefined. While one large randomized study demonstrated the supe-
riority  of  e-cigarettes  compared  to  traditional  nicotine  replacement 
therapy in aiding smoking cessation, e-cigarette– or vaping-associated 
lung injury (EVALI) is an emerging phenomenon that poses risks that 
may  counterbalance  the  potential  benefit  in  helping  patients  reduce 
traditional cigarette consumption and lung cancer risk.

Although  cigarette  smoking  is  the  cause  of  the  majority  of  lung 
cancers,  several  other  risk  factors  have  been  identified,  including 
occupational  exposure  to  asbestos,  arsenic,  bischloromethyl  ether, 
hexavalent chromium, mustard gas, nickel (as in certain nickel-refining 
processes), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Ionizing radiation is also an established lung carcinogen, most con-
vincingly demonstrated from studies showing increased rates of lung 
cancer  among  survivors  of  the  atom  bombs  dropped  on  Hiroshima 
and  Nagasaki  and  large  excesses  among  workers  exposed  to  alpha 
irradiation  from  radon  in  underground  uranium  mining.  Prolonged 
exposure  to  low-level  radon  in  homes  might  impart  a  risk  of  lung 
cancer equal to or greater than that of ETS. Prior lung diseases such as 
chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and tuberculosis have been linked to 
increased risks of lung cancer as well. The risk of lung cancer appears to 
be higher among individuals with low fruit and vegetable intake during 
adulthood. This observation led to hypotheses that specific nutrients, 
in particular retinoids and carotenoids, might have chemopreventative 
effects  for  lung  cancer.  However,  randomized  trials  failed  to  validate 
this hypothesis.

ill-defined  cell  borders,  finely  granular  nuclear  chromatin,  absent  or 
inconspicuous  nucleoli,  and  a  high  mitotic  count.  SCLC  may  be  dis-
tinguished  from  NSCLC  by  the  presence  of  neuroendocrine  markers 
including CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), synaptophysin, 
and chromogranin. Adenocarcinomas possess glandular differentiation 
or  mucin  production  and  may  show  acinar,  papillary,  lepidic,  or  solid 
features or a mixture of these patterns. Squamous cell carcinomas of the 
lung are morphologically identical to extrapulmonary squamous cell car-
cinomas and cannot be distinguished by immunohistochemistry alone. 
Squamous  cell  tumors  show  keratinization  and/or  intercellular  bridges 
that arise from bronchial epithelium. The tumor consists of sheets of cells 
rather than the three-dimensional groups of cells characteristic of adeno-
carcinomas. Large-cell carcinomas compose <10% of lung carcinomas. 
These tumors lack the cytologic and architectural features of small-cell 
carcinoma  and  glandular  or  squamous  differentiation.  Together,  these 
four histologic types account for ∼90% of all epithelial lung cancers.

All histologic types of lung cancer can develop in current and for-
mer smokers, although squamous and small-cell carcinomas are most 
commonly associated with tobacco use. With the decline in cigarette 
consumption,  adenocarcinoma  has  become  the  most  frequent  his-
tologic subtype of lung cancer in the United States. In lifetime never 
smokers  or  former  light  smokers  (<10  pack-year  history),  women, 
and younger adults (<60 years), adenocarcinoma tends to be the most 
common form of lung cancer.

In  addition  to  distinguishing  between  SCLC  and  NSCLC,  because 
these  tumors  have  quite  different  natural  histories  and  therapeutic 
approaches  (see  below),  it  is  necessary  to  classify  whether  NSCLC  is 
squamous or nonsquamous. The classification system, developed jointly 
by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the Amer-
ican  Thoracic  Society,  and  the  European  Respiratory  Society,  provides 
an integrated approach to the classification of lung adenocarcinoma that 
includes clinical, molecular, radiographic, and pathologic information.

It is recognized that most lung cancers present in an advanced stage 
and  are  often  diagnosed  based  on  small  biopsies  or  cytologic  speci-
mens, rendering clear histologic distinctions difficult, if not impossible. 
In  such  cases,  particularly  in  patients  with  advanced-stage  disease,  a 
repeat  biopsy  is  recommended  to  obtain  additional  tissue  for  further 
clarification.  The  distinction  between  squamous  and  nonsquamous 
lung cancer is viewed as critical to optimal therapeutic decision making, 
and  a  diagnosis  of  non-small-cell  carcinoma,  not  otherwise  specified  is 
no longer considered acceptable. This distinction can be achieved using 
a single marker for adenocarcinoma (thyroid transcription factor-1 or 
napsin-A) plus a squamous marker (p40 or p63) and/or mucin stains. If 
tissue is limited and a clear morphologic pattern is evident, a diagnosis 
can  be  made  without  immunohistochemistry  staining.  In  addition  to 
determining  histologic  subtype,  preservation  of  sufficient  specimen 
material for appropriate molecular testing and PD-L1 testing necessary 
to help guide therapeutic decision making is recommended (see below).

Smoking Cessation  Given the undeniable link between cigarette 
smoking  and  lung  cancer,  physicians  must  promote  tobacco  absti-
nence. Stopping tobacco use before middle age avoids >90% of the lung 
cancer risk attributable to tobacco. Importantly, smoking cessation can 
even be beneficial in individuals with an established diagnosis of lung 
cancer,  as  it  is  associated  with  improved  survival,  fewer  side  effects 
from  therapy,  and  an  overall  improvement  in  quality  of  life.  Conse-
quently,  it  is  important  to  promote  smoking  cessation  even  after  the 
diagnosis of lung cancer is established.

Physicians  need  to  understand  the  essential  elements  of  smoking 
cessation therapy. The individual must want to stop smoking and must 
be  willing  to  work  hard  to  achieve  the  goal  of  smoking  abstinence. 
Self-help  strategies  alone  only  marginally  affect  quit  rates,  whereas 
individual  and  combined  pharmacotherapies  in  combination  with 
counseling can significantly increase rates of cessation. Therapy with 
an antidepressant (e.g., bupropion) and nicotine replacement therapy 
(varenicline, a α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist) are 
approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  as  first-
line treatments for nicotine dependence. In a randomized trial, vareni-
cline  was  shown  to  be  more  efficacious  than  bupropion  or  placebo. 
Prolonged use of varenicline beyond the initial induction phase proved 
useful in maintaining smoking abstinence. Clonidine and nortriptyline 
are recommended as second-line treatments. A role for e-cigarettes has 
not been definitively established (Chap. 454).

Inherited Predisposition to Lung Cancer  Exposure to environ-
mental  carcinogens,  such  as  those  found  in  tobacco  smoke,  induce  or 
facilitate the transformation from bronchoepithelial cells to a malignant 
phenotype. The contribution of carcinogens to transformation is modu-
lated by polymorphic variations in genes that affect aspects of carcinogen 
metabolism. Certain genetic polymorphisms of the P450 enzyme system, 
specifically CYP1A1, and chromosome fragility are associated with the 
development of lung cancer. These genetic variations occur at relatively 
high frequency in the population, but their contribution to an individ-
ual’s lung cancer risk is generally low. However, because of their popu-
lation frequency, the overall impact on lung cancer risk could be high.

First-degree relatives of lung cancer probands have a two- to three-
fold excess risk of lung cancer and other cancers, many of which are not 
smoking-related. These data suggest that specific genes and/or genetic 
variants may contribute to susceptibility to lung cancer. However, very 
few  such  genes  have  yet  been  identified.  Individuals  with  inherited 
mutations in RB (patients with retinoblastoma living to adulthood) and 
p53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) genes may develop lung cancer. Common 
gene variants involved in lung cancer have identified three separate loci 
that are associated with lung cancer (5p15, 6p21, and 15q25) and include 
genes  that  regulate  acetylcholine  nicotinic  receptors  and  telomerase 
production.  A  rare  germline  mutation  (T790M)  involving  the  epider-
mal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  maybe  be  linked  to  lung  cancer 
susceptibility in never smokers. Likewise, a suscep-
tibility  locus  on  chromosome  6q  greatly  increases 
lung  cancer  risk  among  light  and  never  smokers. 
Although  progress  has  been  made,  there  is  a  sig-
nificant  amount  of  work  that  remains  to  be  done 
in identifying heritable risk factors for lung cancer. 
Currently no molecular criteria are suitable to select 
patients for more intense screening programs or for 
specific chemopreventive strategies.

 ■ PATHOLOGY
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  defines 
lung  cancer  as  tumors  arising  from  the  respira-
tory epithelium (bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli). 
The  WHO  classification  system  divides  epithelial 
lung  cancers  into  four  major  cell  types:  small-cell 
lung  cancer  (SCLC),  adenocarcinoma,  squamous 
cell  carcinoma,  and  large-cell  carcinoma;  the  latter 
three types are collectively known as non-small-cell 
carcinomas (NSCLCs) (Fig. 78-1). Small-cell carci-
nomas  consist  of  small  cells  with  scant  cytoplasm,

The  terms  adenocarcinoma  in  situ  and  minimally  invasive  adeno-
carcinoma  are  now  recommended  for  small  solitary  adenocarcinomas  
(≤3  cm)  with  either  pure  lepidic  growth  (term  used  to  describe  single- 
layered  growth  of  atypical  cuboidal  cells  coating  the  alveolar  walls)  or 
predominant lepidic growth with ≤5 mm invasion. Individuals with these 
entities experience 100% or near 100% 5-year disease-free survival with 
complete tumor resection. Invasive adenocarcinomas, representing more 
than 70–90% of surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas, are now clas-
sified by their predominant pattern: lepidic, acinar, papillary, and solid 
patterns. Lepidic-predominant subtype has a favorable prognosis, acinar 
and  papillary  have  an  intermediate  prognosis,  and  solid-predominant 
has a poor prognosis. The terms signet ring and clear cell adenocarcinoma 
have been eliminated from the variants of invasive lung adenocarcinoma, 
whereas the term micropapillary, a subtype with a particularly poor prog-
nosis, has been added. Because of prognostic implications, squamous cell 
carcinoma has also been modified to consist of keratinizing, nonkeratin-
izing, and basaloid, analogous to head and neck cancers.

 ■ IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
The diagnosis of lung cancer most often rests on the morphologic or 
cytologic  features  correlated  with  clinical  and  radiographic  findings. 
Immunohistochemistry may be used to verify neuroendocrine differ-
entiation within a tumor, with markers such as neuron-specific enolase 
(NSE),  CD56  or  NCAM,  synaptophysin,  chromogranin,  and  Leu7. 
Immunohistochemistry is also helpful in differentiating primary from 
metastatic  adenocarcinomas;  thyroid  transcription  factor-1  (TTF-1), 
identified  in  tumors  of  thyroid  and  pulmonary  origin,  is  positive  in 
>70%  of  pulmonary  adenocarcinomas  and  is  a  reliable  indicator  of 
primary lung cancer, provided a thyroid primary has been excluded. A 
negative TTF-1, however, does not exclude the possibility of a lung pri-
mary. TTF-1 is also positive in neuroendocrine tumors of pulmonary 
and extrapulmonary origin. Napsin-A (Nap-A) is an aspartic protease 
that  plays  an  important  role  in  maturation  of  surfactant  B7  and  is 
expressed  in  cytoplasm  of  type  II  pneumocytes.  In  several  studies, 
Nap-A has been reported in >90% of primary lung adenocarcinomas. 
Notably, a combination of Nap-A and TTF-1 is useful in distinguishing 
primary lung adenocarcinoma (Nap-A positive, TTF-1 positive) from 
primary  lung  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (Nap-A 
negative,  TTF-1  negative)  and  primary  SCLC 
(Nap-A  negative,  TTF-1  positive).  Cytokeratins 
7  and  20  used  in  combination  can  help  narrow 
the  differential  diagnosis;  nonsquamous  NSCLC, 
SCLC,  and  mesothelioma  may  stain  positive  for 
CK7  and  negative  for  CK20,  whereas  squamous 
cell lung cancer often will be both CK7 and CK20 
negative. p63 is a useful marker for the detection of 
NSCLCs with squamous differentiation when used 
in  cytologic  pulmonary  samples.  Mesothelioma 
can be easily identified ultrastructurally, but it has 
historically been difficult to differentiate from ade-
nocarcinoma  through  morphology  and  immuno-
histochemical staining. Several markers in the past 
few years have proven to be more helpful including 
CK5/6, calretinin, and Wilms tumor gene-1 (WT-
1), all of which show positivity in mesothelioma.

Unknown

the study of lung cancer, the sequence of events that leads to disease is 
clearly different for the various histopathologic entities.

For cancers in general, one theory holds that a small subset of the 
cells within a tumor (i.e., “stem cells”) are responsible for the full malig-
nant behavior of the tumor. As part of this concept, the large bulk of 
the cells in a cancer are “offspring” of these cancer stem cells. While 
clonally  related  to  the  cancer  stem  cell  subpopulation,  most  cells  by 
themselves cannot regenerate the full malignant phenotype. The stem 
cell concept may explain the failure of standard medical therapies to 
eradicate lung cancers, even when there is a clinical complete response. 
Disease recurs because therapies do not eliminate the stem cell com-
ponent, which may be more resistant to therapy. Precise human lung 
cancer stem cells have yet to be identified.

Among  lung  cancer  histologies,  adenocarcinomas  have  been  the 
most  extensively  catalogued  for  recurrent  genomic  gains  and  losses 
as  well  as  for  somatic  mutations  (Fig. 78-2, Table 78-1).  While  mul-
tiple  different  kinds  of  aberrations  have  been  found,  a  major  class 
involves  “driver  mutations,”  which  are  mutations  that  occur  in  genes 
encoding  signaling  proteins  that,  when  aberrant,  drive  initiation  and 
maintenance  of  tumor  cells.  Importantly,  driver  mutations  can  serve 
as  a  potential  Achilles’  heels  for  tumors,  if  their  gene  products  can 
be  targeted  appropriately.  These  genes  encode  cell-surface  receptors 
consisting  of  an  extracellular  ligand-binding  domain,  a  transmem-
brane structure, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. The 
binding  of  ligand  to  receptor  activates  receptor  dimerization  and  TK 
autophosphorylation,  initiating  a  cascade  of  intracellular  events,  and 
leading to increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and a 
decrease in apoptosis. Lung adenocarcinomas can arise when normal 
alveolar type II cells develop mutations in EGFR, BRAF, MET, KRAS, 
and  PIK3CA.  These  same  tumors  display  high  sensitivity  to  small- 
molecule  TK  inhibitors  (TKIs).  Additional  subsets  of  lung  adenocar-
cinoma  have  been  identified  as  defined  by  the  presence  of  specific 
chromosomal  rearrangements,  resulting  in  the  aberrant  activation  of 
the TKs ALK, ROS1, NTRK, and RET. Notably, most driver mutations in 
lung cancer appear to be mutually exclusive, suggesting that acquisition 
of one of these mutations is sufficient to drive tumorigenesis. Although 
driver  mutations  have  mostly  been  found  in  adenocarcinomas,  three

 ■ MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS
As proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg, virtually 
all  cancer  cells  acquire  six  hallmark  capabilities: 
self-sufficiency  in  growth  signals,  insensitivity  to 
antigrowth  signals,  evading  apoptosis,  limitless 
replicative  potential,  sustained  angiogenesis,  and 
tissue invasion and metastasis. The order in which 
these hallmark capabilities are acquired is variable. 
Events  leading  to  acquisition  of  these  hallmarks 
vary  widely,  although  broadly,  cancers  arise  as  a 
result of accumulations of gain-of-function muta-
tions in oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations 
in  tumor-suppressor  genes.  Further  complicating

potential molecular targets have been identified in squamous cell lung 
carcinomas:  FGFR1  amplification,  DDR2  mutations,  and  PIK3CA 
mutations/PTEN loss as well as BRAF and MET (Table 78-1).

A  large  number  of  tumor-suppressor  genes  have  also  been  identi-
fied that are inactivated during the pathogenesis of lung cancer. These 
include TP53, RB1, RASSF1A, CDKN2A/B, LKB1 (STK11), and FHIT. 
Nearly  90%  of  SCLCs  harbor  mutations  in  TP53  and  RB1.  Several 
tumor-suppressor  genes  on  chromosome  3p  appear  to  be  involved  in 
nearly  all  lung  cancers.  Allelic  loss  of  this  region  occurs  very  early  in 
lung cancer pathogenesis, including in histologically normal smoking- 
damaged lung epithelium.
EARLY DETECTION AND SCREENING
In lung cancer, clinical outcome is related to the stage at diagnosis, and 
hence, it is generally assumed that early detection of occult tumors will 
lead  to  improved  survival.  Early  detection  is  a  process  that  involves 
screening  tests,  surveillance,  diagnosis,  and  early  treatment.  Screen-
ing  refers  to  the  use  of  tests  across  a  healthy  population  in  order  to 
identify  individuals  who  harbor  asymptomatic  disease.  For  a  screen-
ing program to be successful, the target population must have a high 
burden of disease; the test must be sensitive, specific, accessible, and 
cost effective; and effective treatment must be available that can reduce 
mortality.  With  any  screening  procedure,  it  is  important  to  consider 
the  possible  influence  of  lead-time  bias  (detecting  the  cancer  earlier 
without  an  effect  on  survival),  length-time  bias  (indolent  cancers  are 
detected on screening and may not affect survival, whereas aggressive 
cancers  are  likely  to  cause  symptoms  earlier  in  patients  and  are  less 
likely  to  be  detected),  and  overdiagnosis  (diagnosing  cancers  so  slow 
growing that they are unlikely to cause the death of the patient).

Because  a  majority  of  lung  cancer  patients  present  with  advanced 
disease beyond the scope of surgical resection, the value of screening 
for  this  condition  is  debated.  Indeed,  randomized  controlled  trials 
conducted in the 1960s to 1980s using screening chest x-rays (CXR), 
with or without sputum cytology, reported no impact on lung cancer– 
specific  mortality  in  patients  characterized  as  high  risk  (males  age  
≥45 years with a smoking history). These studies have been criticized 
for their design, statistical analyses, and outdated imaging modalities. 
In contrast to CXR, low-dose, noncontrast, thin-slice spiral chest com-
puted tomography (LDCT) has emerged as an effective tool to screen 
for  lung  cancer.  In  nonrandomized  studies  conducted  in  the  1990s, 
LDCT scans were shown to detect more lung nodules and cancers than 
standard CXR in selected high-risk populations (e.g., age ≥60 years and 
a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years). Notably, up to 85% of the lung 
cancers discovered in these trials were classified as stage I disease and 
therefore considered potentially curable with surgical resection.

These  data  prompted  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  to  ini-
tiate  the  National  Lung  Screening  Trial  (NLST),  a  randomized  study 
designed  to  determine  if  LDCT  screening  could  reduce  mortality 
from lung cancer in high-risk populations as compared with standard 
posterior anterior CXR. High-risk patients were defined as individuals 
between 55 and 74 years of age, with a ≥30 pack-year history of cig-
arette  smoking;  former  smokers  must  have  quit  within  the  previous  
15 years. Excluded from the trial were individuals with a previous lung 
cancer diagnosis, a history of hemoptysis, an unexplained weight loss 
of  >15  lb  in  the  preceding  year,  or  a  chest  CT  within  18  months  of 
enrollment. A total of 53,454 persons were enrolled and randomized to 
annual screening yearly for 3 years (LDCT screening, n = 26,722; CXR 
screening, n = 26,732). Any noncalcified nodule measuring ≥4 mm in 
any diameter found on LDCT and CXR images with any noncalcified 
nodule or mass were classified as “positive.” Participating radiologists 
had  the  option  of  not  calling  a  final  screen  positive  if  a  noncalcified 
nodule had been stable on the three screening examinations. Overall, 
39.1% of participants in the LDCT group and 16% in the CXR group 
had at least one positive screening result. Of those who screened pos-
itive, the false-positive rate was 96.4% in the LDCT group and 94.5% 
in the CXR group. This was consistent across all three rounds. In the 
LDCT group, 1060 cancers were identified compared with 941 cancers 
in the CXR group (645 vs 572 per 100,000 person-years; relative risk 
[RR],  1.13;  95%  confidence  interval  [CI],  1.03–1.23).  Nearly  twice  as 
many  stage  IA  cancers  were  detected  in  the  LDCT  group  compared 
with  the  CXR  group  (40%  vs  21%).  The  overall  rates  of  lung  can-
cer  death  were  247  and  309  deaths  per  100,000  participants  in  the 
LDCT  and  CXR  groups,  respectively,  representing  a  20%  reduction 
in  lung  cancer  mortality  in  the  LDCT-screened  population  (95%  CI, 
6.8–26.7%; p = .004). Compared with the CXR group, the rate of death 
in  the  LDCT  group  from  any  cause  was  reduced  by  6.7%  (95%  CI, 
1.2–13.6%; p = .02). The number needed to screen (NNTS) to prevent 
one lung cancer death was calculated to be 320.

The  Nelson  study  was  a  second  randomized  trial  comparing  no 
screening to CT scans at baseline and in years 1, 3, and 5.5 in 13,195 
men and 2594 women. Participants were 50–75 years of age and were 
current  and  former  smokers  with  10  years  or  less  of  cessation  who 
smoked  >15  cigarettes  a  day  for  >25  years  or  >10  cigarettes  daily 
for  >30  years.  Participants  were  selected  from  four  regions  in  the  
Netherlands or Belgium and were excluded if they were in moderate or 
bad self-reported health, were unable to climb two flights of stairs, had 
a body weight >140 kg, had a CT of the chest within the past year or 
a history of lung cancer <5 years ago or were still under treatment, or 
had current or past renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, or breast cancer. 
The hazard ratio for lung cancer mortality at 10 years was 0.74 (95% CI, 
0.60–0.91; p = .003) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.35–1.04; p = .0543) in men and 
women, respectively. These two trials have validated the use of annual 
CT scans for early detection of lung cancer in high-risk populations.

LDCT screening for lung cancer comes with known risks including 
a  high  rate  of  false-positive  results,  false-negative  results,  potential 
for  unnecessary  follow-up  testing,  radiation  exposure,  overdiagnosis, 
changes  in  anxiety  level  and  quality  of  life,  and  substantial  financial 
costs. By far, the biggest challenge confronting the use of CT screening 
is  the  high  false-positive  rate.  False  positives  can  have  a  substantial 
impact on patients through the expense and risk of unneeded further 
evaluation  and  emotional  stress.  The  management  of  these  patients 
usually consists of serial CT scans over time to see if the nodules grow, 
attempted fine-needle aspirates, or surgical resection. At $300 per scan 
(NCI estimated cost), the outlay for initial LDCT alone could run into 
the billions of dollars annually, an expense that only further escalates 
when  factoring  in  various  downstream  expenditures  an  individual 
might  incur  in  the  assessment  of  positive  findings.  A  formal  cost- 
effectiveness  analysis  of  the  NLST  demonstrated  differences  between 
sex,  age,  and  current  smoking  status  and  the  method  of  follow-up. 
Despite some questions, LDCT screening has been recommended for 
all patients meeting criteria for enrollment on NLST. When discussing 
the option of LDCT screening, use of absolute risks rather than relative 
risks is helpful because studies indicate the public can process absolute 
terminology  more  effectively  than  relative  risk  projections.  A  useful

(Table 78-2).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Over half of all patients diagnosed with lung cancer present with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The majority of 
patients present with signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities that 
can be attributed to the primary lesion, local tumor growth, invasion 
or obstruction of adjacent structures, growth at distant metastatic sites, 
or a paraneoplastic syndrome (Tables 78-3 and 78-4). The prototypical 
lung cancer patient is a current or former smoker of either sex, usually 
in the seventh decade of life. A history of chronic cough with or with-
out hemoptysis in a current or former smoker with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  age  40  years  or  older  should  prompt  a 
thorough  investigation  for  lung  cancer  even  in  the  face  of  a  normal 
CXR.  A  persistent  pneumonia  without  constitutional  symptoms  and 
unresponsive  to  repeated  courses  of  antibiotics  also  should  prompt 
an evaluation for the underlying cause. Lung cancer arising in a life-
time never smoker is more common in women and East Asians. Such 
patients  also  tend  to  be  younger  than  their  smoking  counterparts  at 
the time of diagnosis. The clinical presentation of lung cancer in never 
smokers tends to mirror that of current and former smokers.

Patients with central or endobronchial growth of the primary tumor 
may  present  with  cough,  hemoptysis,  wheeze,  stridor,  dyspnea,  or

postobstructive pneumonia. Peripheral growth of the primary tumor 
may cause pain from pleural or chest wall involvement, dyspnea on a 
restrictive basis, and symptoms of a lung abscess resulting from tumor 
cavitation.  Regional  spread  of  tumor  in  the  thorax  (by  contiguous 
growth  or  by  metastasis  to  regional  lymph  nodes)  may  cause  tra-
cheal obstruction, esophageal compression with dysphagia, recurrent 
laryngeal  nerve  paralysis  with  hoarseness,  phrenic  nerve  palsy  with 
elevation of the hemidiaphragm and dyspnea, and sympathetic nerve 
paralysis with Horner’s syndrome (enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis, and 
anhidrosis).  Malignant  pleural  effusions  can  cause  pain,  dyspnea,  or 
cough.  Pancoast  (or  superior  sulcus  tumor)  syndromes  result  from 
local extension of a tumor growing in the apex of the lung with involve-
ment of the eighth cervical and first and second thoracic nerves, and 
present with shoulder pain that characteristically radiates in the ulnar 
distribution of the arm, often with radiologic destruction of the first 
and  second  ribs.  Often  Horner’s  syndrome  and  Pancoast  syndrome 
coexist. Other problems of regional spread include superior vena cava 
syndrome from vascular obstruction; pericardial and cardiac extension 
with  resultant  tamponade,  arrhythmia,  or  cardiac  failure;  lymphatic 
obstruction  with  resultant  pleural  effusion;  and  lymphangitic  spread 
through  the  lungs  with  hypoxemia  and  dyspnea.  In  addition,  lung 
cancer  can  spread  transbronchially,  producing  tumor  growth  along 
multiple alveolar surfaces with impairment of gas exchange, respiratory 
insufficiency, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and sputum production. Constitu-
tional  symptoms  may  include  anorexia,  weight  loss,  weakness,  fever, 
and night sweats. Apart from the brevity of symptom duration, these 
parameters fail to clearly distinguish SCLC from NSCLC or even from 
neoplasms metastatic to lungs.

Extrathoracic  metastatic  disease  is  found  at  autopsy  in  >50%  of 
patients  with  squamous  carcinoma,  80%  of  patients  with  adenocar-
cinoma  and  large-cell  carcinoma,  and  >95%  of  patients  with  SCLC. 
Approximately one-third of patients present with symptoms as a result 
of  distant  metastases.  Lung  cancer  metastases  may  occur  in  virtually 
every  organ  system,  and  the  site  of  metastatic  involvement  largely 
determines other symptoms. Patients with brain metastases may pres-
ent with headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, or neurologic defi-
cits. Patients with bone metastases may present with pain, pathologic 
fractures, or spinal cord compression. The latter may also occur with 
epidural metastases. Individuals with bone marrow invasion may pres-
ent with cytopenias or leukoerythroblastosis. Those with liver metas-
tases may present with hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, fever, 
anorexia, and weight loss. Liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction are 
rare. Adrenal metastases are common but rarely cause pain or adrenal 
insufficiency unless they are large.

Paraneoplastic syndromes are common in patients with lung cancer, 
especially those with SCLC, and may be the presenting finding or the 
first  sign  of  recurrence.  In  addition,  paraneoplastic  syndromes  may 
mimic  metastatic  disease  and,  unless  detected,  lead  to  inappropriate

palliative  rather  than  curative  treatment.  Often  the  paraneoplastic 
syndrome may be relieved with successful treatment of the tumor. In 
some  cases,  the  pathophysiology  of  the  paraneoplastic  syndrome  is 
known, particularly when a hormone with biologic activity is secreted 
by a tumor. However, in many cases, the pathophysiology is unknown. 
Systemic symptoms of anorexia, cachexia, weight loss (seen in 30% of 
patients), fever, and suppressed immunity are paraneoplastic syndromes 
of  unknown  etiology  or  at  least  not  well  defined.  Weight  loss  >10% 
of  total  body  weight  is  considered  a  bad  prognostic  sign.  Endocrine 
syndromes  are  seen  in  12%  of  patients;  hypercalcemia  resulting  from 
ectopic production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or, more commonly, 
PTH-related  peptide  is  the  most  common  life-threatening  metabolic 
complication  of  malignancy,  primarily  occurring  with  squamous  cell 
carcinomas  of  the  lung.  Clinical  symptoms  include  nausea,  vomiting, 
abdominal pain, constipation, polyuria, thirst, and altered mental status.
Hyponatremia  may  be  caused  by  the  syndrome  of  inappropriate 
secretion  of  antidiuretic  hormone  (SIADH)  or  possibly  atrial  natri-
uretic  peptide  (ANP)  (Chap.  93).  SIADH  resolves  within  1–4  weeks 
of  initiating  chemotherapy  in  the  vast  majority  of  cases.  During  this 
period, serum sodium can usually be managed and maintained above 
128  mEq/L  via  fluid  restriction.  Demeclocycline  can  be  a  useful 
adjunctive measure when fluid restriction alone is insufficient. Vaso-
pressin receptor antagonists like tolvaptan also have been used in the 
management of SIADH. However, the use of tolvaptan has significant 
limitations  including  liver  injury  and  overly  rapid  correction  of  the 
hyponatremia, which can lead to irreversible neurologic injury. Like-
wise, the cost of tolvaptan may be prohibitive (as high as $300 per tablet 
in  some  areas).  Of  note,  patients  with  ectopic  ANP  may  have  wors-
ening hyponatremia if sodium intake is not concomitantly increased. 
Accordingly, if hyponatremia fails to improve or worsens after 3–4 days 
of adequate fluid restriction, plasma levels of ANP should be measured 
to determine the causative syndrome.

Ectopic  secretion  of  ACTH  by  SCLC  and  pulmonary  carcinoids 
usually results in additional electrolyte disturbances, especially hypo-
kalemia,  rather  than  the  changes  in  body  habitus  that  occur  in  
Cushing’s syndrome from a pituitary adenoma (Chap. 93). Treatment 
with  standard  medications,  such  as  metyrapone  and  ketoconazole, 
is  largely  ineffective  due  to  extremely  high  cortisol  levels.  The  most 
effective strategy for management of the Cushing’s syndrome is effec-
tive treatment of the underlying SCLC. Bilateral adrenalectomy may be 
considered in extreme cases.

Skeletal–connective  tissue  syndromes  include  clubbing  in  30%  of 
cases  (usually  NSCLCs)  and  hypertrophic  primary  osteoarthropathy 
in  1–10%  of  cases  (usually  adenocarcinomas).  Patients  may  develop 
periostitis,  causing  pain,  tenderness,  and  swelling  over  the  affected 
bones  and  a  positive  bone  scan.  Neurologic–myopathic  syndromes 
are seen in only 1% of patients but are dramatic and include the myas-
thenic  Eaton-Lambert  syndrome  and  retinal  blindness  with  SCLC, 
whereas  peripheral  neuropathies,  subacute  cerebellar  degeneration, 
cortical degeneration, and polymyositis are seen with all lung cancer 
types.  Many  of  these  are  caused  by  autoimmune  responses  such  as 
the  development  of  anti-voltage-gated  calcium  channel  antibodies  in 
Eaton-Lambert  syndrome.  Patients  with  this  disorder  present  with 
proximal  muscle  weakness,  usually  in  the  lower  extremities,  occa-
sional  autonomic  dysfunction,  and  rarely,  cranial  nerve  symptoms 
or involvement of the bulbar or respiratory muscles. Depressed deep 
tendon  reflexes  are  frequently  present.  In  contrast  to  patients  with 
myasthenia gravis, strength improves with serial effort. Some patients 
who respond to chemotherapy will have resolution of the neurologic 
abnormalities.  Thus,  chemotherapy  is  the  initial  treatment  of  choice. 
Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and sensory neuropathies, cerebellar 
degeneration,  limbic  encephalitis,  and  brainstem  encephalitis  occur 
in SCLC in association with a variety of antineuronal antibodies such 
as  anti-Hu,  anti-CRMP5,  and  ANNA-3.  Paraneoplastic  cerebellar 
degeneration may be associated with anti-Hu, anti-Yo, or P/Q calcium 
channel autoantibodies. Coagulation or thrombotic or other hemato-
logic manifestations occur in 1–8% of patients and include migratory 
venous thrombophlebitis (Trousseau’s syndrome), nonbacterial throm-
botic  (marantic)  endocarditis  with  arterial  emboli,  and  disseminated 

intravascular  coagulation  with  hemorrhage,  anemia,  granulocytosis, 
and leukoerythroblastosis. Thrombotic disease complicating cancer is 
usually a poor prognostic sign. Cutaneous manifestations such as der-
matomyositis and acanthosis nigricans are uncommon (1%), as are the 
renal  manifestations  of  nephrotic  syndrome  and  glomerulonephritis 
(≤1%).

DIAGNOSING LUNG CANCER
Tissue sampling is required to confirm a diagnosis in all patients with 
suspected lung cancer. In patients with suspected metastatic disease, a 
biopsy of a distant site of disease is preferred for tissue confirmation. 
Given the greater emphasis placed on molecular and PD-L1 testing for 
NSCLC patients, a core biopsy is preferred to ensure adequate tissue 
for analysis. Tumor tissue may be obtained via minimally invasive tech-
niques  such  as  bronchial  or  transbronchial  biopsy  during  fiberoptic 
bronchoscopy, by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or percutaneous biopsy 
using image guidance, or via endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided 
biopsy. Depending on the location, lymph node sampling may occur 
via  transesophageal  endoscopic  ultrasound  (EUS)-guided  biopsy, 
EBUS-guided biopsy, or blind biopsy. In patients with suspected met-
astatic disease, a diagnosis may be confirmed by bronchoscopy, percu-
taneous biopsy of a soft tissue mass, lytic bone lesion, bone marrow, 
pleural or liver lesion, or an adequate cell block obtained from a malig-
nant  pleural  effusion.  In  patients  with  a  suspected  malignant  pleural 
effusion, if the initial thoracentesis is negative, a repeat thoracentesis is 
warranted. Although the majority of pleural effusions are due to malig-
nant disease, particularly if they are exudative or bloody, some may be 
parapneumonic. In the absence of distant disease, such patients should 
be considered for possible curative treatment.

The  diagnostic  yield  of  any  biopsy  depends  on  several  factors 
including location (accessibility) of the tumor, tumor size, tumor type, 
and technical aspects of the diagnostic procedure including the expe-
rience level of the bronchoscopist and pathologist. In general, central 
lesions  such  as  squamous  cell  carcinomas,  small-cell  carcinomas,  or 
endobronchial lesions such as carcinoid tumors are more readily diag-
nosed by bronchoscopic examination, whereas peripheral lesions such 
as adenocarcinomas and large-cell carcinomas are more amenable to 
transthoracic biopsy.

Sputum  cytology  is  inexpensive  and  noninvasive  but  has  a  lower 
yield than other specimen types due to poor preservation of the cells 
and more variability in acquiring a good-quality specimen. The yield 
for sputum cytology is highest for larger and centrally located tumors 
such as squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma histology. 
The specificity for sputum cytology averages close to 100%, although 
sensitivity  is  generally  <70%.  The  accuracy  of  sputum  cytology 
improves  with  increased  numbers  of  specimens  analyzed.  Conse-
quently, analysis of at least three sputum specimens is recommended. 
However, the quality of the specimen may not be adequate for histo-
logic subclassification and PD-L1 and molecular testing.

STAGING LUNG CANCER
Lung cancer staging consists of two parts: first, a determination of the 
location of the tumor and possible metastatic sites (anatomic staging), 
and  second,  an  assessment  of  a  patient’s  ability  to  withstand  various 
antitumor  treatments  (physiologic  staging).  All  patients  with  lung 
cancer should have a complete history and physical examination, with 
evaluation of all other medical problems, determination of performance 
status,  and  history  of  weight  loss.  Staging  with  regard  to  a  patient’s 
potential for surgical resection is principally applicable to NSCLC.

 ■ ANATOMIC STAGING OF PATIENTS WITH LUNG 
CANCER
The  accurate  staging  of  patients  with  NSCLC  is  essential  for  deter-
mining  the  appropriate  treatment  in  patients  with  resectable  disease 
and  for  avoiding  unnecessary  surgical  procedures  in  patients  with 
advanced  disease.  All  patients  with  NSCLC  should  undergo  initial 
radiographic  imaging  with  CT  scan,  positron  emission  tomography 
(PET), or preferably CT-PET. PET scanning attempts to identify sites 
of malignancy based on glucose metabolism by measuring the uptake

of  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG).  Rap-
idly  dividing  cells,  presumably  in  the 
lung  tumors,  will  preferentially  take  up 
18F-FDG  and  appear  as  a  “hot  spot.”  To 
date, PET has been mostly used for stag-
ing  and  detection  of  metastases  in  lung 
cancer  and  in  the  detection  of  nodules 
>15  mm  in  diameter.  Combined  18F-
FDG  PET-CT  imaging  has  been  shown 
to  improve  the  accuracy  of  staging  in 
NSCLC  compared  to  visual  correlation 
of  PET  and  CT  or  either  study  alone. 
CT-PET  has  been  found  to  be  superior 
in  identifying  pathologically  enlarged 
mediastinal  lymph  nodes  and  extratho-
racic metastases. A standardized uptake 
value  (SUV)  of  >2.5  on  PET  is  highly 
suspicious  for  malignancy.  False  nega-
tives  can  be  seen  in  diabetes,  in  lesions 
<8  mm,  and  in  slow-growing  tumors 
(e.g.,  carcinoid  tumors  or  well-differen-
tiated  adenocarcinoma).  False  positives 
can  be  seen  in  certain  infections  and 
granulomatous  disease  (e.g.,  tubercu-
losis).  Thus,  PET  should  never  be  used 
alone  to  diagnose  lung  cancer,  medias-
tinal  involvement,  or  metastases.  Con-
firmation with tissue biopsy is required. 
For  brain  metastases,  magnetic  reso-
nance imaging (MRI) is the most effec-
tive  method.  MRI  can  also  be  useful  in 
selected circumstances, such as superior 
sulcus tumors to rule out brachial plexus 
involvement,  but  in  general,  MRI  does 
not play a major role in NSCLC staging.
In patients with NSCLC, the following 
are  contraindications  to  potential  cura-
tive  resection:  extrathoracic  metastases, 
superior  vena  cava  syndrome,  vocal 
cord  and,  in  most  cases,  phrenic  nerve 
paralysis,  malignant  pleural  effusion, 
cardiac  tamponade,  tumor  within  2  cm 
of  the  carina  (potentially  curable  with 
combined  chemoradiotherapy),  metas-
tasis  to  the  contralateral  lung,  metas-
tases  to  supraclavicular  lymph  nodes, 
contralateral  mediastinal  node  metasta-
ses  (potentially  curable  with  combined 
chemoradiotherapy),  and  involvement 
of the main pulmonary artery. In situations where it will make a differ-
ence in treatment, abnormal scan findings require tissue confirmation 
of malignancy so that patients are not precluded from having poten-
tially curative therapy.

The  best  predictor  of  metastatic  disease  remains  a  careful  history 
and  physical  examination.  If  signs,  symptoms,  or  findings  from  the 
physical examination suggest the presence of malignancy, then sequen-
tial  imaging  starting  with  the  most  appropriate  study  should  be  per-
formed. If the findings from the clinical evaluation are negative, then 
imaging  studies  beyond  CT-PET  are  unnecessary  and  the  search  for 
metastatic disease is complete. In patients in whom distant metastatic 
disease has been ruled out, lymph node status needs to be assessed via 
minimally  invasive  techniques  such  as  those  mentioned  above  and/
or  invasive  techniques  such  as  mediastinoscopy,  mediastinotomy, 
thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy. Approximately one-quarter to one-half 
of patients diagnosed with NSCLC will have mediastinal lymph node 
metastases at the time of diagnosis. Lymph node sampling is recom-
mended  in  all  patients  with  enlarged  nodes  detected  by  CT  or  PET 
scan and in patients with large tumors or tumors occupying the inner 
third of the lung. The extent of mediastinal lymph node involvement is

important in determining the appropriate treatment strategy: surgical

moradiation  followed  by  immunotherapy  (durvalumab)  (see  below). 
A standard nomenclature for referring to the location of lymph nodes 
involved with lung cancer has evolved (Fig. 78-3).

In  SCLC  patients,  current  staging  recommendations  include  a 
PET-CT scan and MRI of the brain (positive in 10% of asymptomatic 
patients). Bone marrow biopsies and aspirations are rarely performed 
now  given  the  low  incidence  of  isolated  bone  marrow  metastases. 
Confirmation  of  metastatic  disease,  ipsilateral  or  contralateral  lung 
nodules, or metastases beyond the mediastinum may be achieved by 
the same modalities recommended earlier for patients with NSCLC.

If a patient has signs or symptoms of spinal cord compression (pain, 
weakness, paralysis, urinary retention), a spinal CT or MRI scan should 
be  performed.  If  metastases  are  evident  on  imaging,  a  neurosurgeon 
should be consulted for possible palliative surgical resection and/or a 
radiation oncologist should be consulted for palliative radiotherapy to 
the site of compression. If signs or symptoms of leptomeningeal dis-
ease develop at any time in a patient with lung cancer, an MRI of the 
brain and spinal cord should be performed, as well as a spinal tap, for

 ■ STAGING SYSTEM FOR NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG 
CANCER
The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) international staging system pro-
vides  useful  prognostic  information  and  is  used  to  stage  all  patients 
with  NSCLC.  The  various  T  (tumor  size),  N  (regional  node  involve-
ment),  and  M  (presence  or  absence  of  distant  metastasis)  stages  are 
combined to form different stage groups (Tables 74-5 and 74-6). The 
eighth  edition  of  the  TNM  staging  system  went  into  effect  in  2018. 
T1  tumors  are  divided  into  tumors  ≤1  cm  (T1a),  >1  cm  and  ≤2  cm 
(T1b),  and  >2  cm  and  ≤3  cm  (T1c).  T2  tumors  are  those  that  are  
>3 cm but ≤5 cm, involve the visceral pleura or main bronchus, or are 
associated with atelectasis; T2a tumors are >3 cm and ≤4 cm, and T2b 
are >4 cm and ≤5 cm. T3 tumors are >5 cm and ≤7 cm. T3 tumors also 
include  tumors  with  invasion  into  local  structures  such  as  the  chest 
wall  and  diaphragm  and  with  additional  nodules  in  the  same  lobe. 
T4 tumors include tumors >7 cm or tumors of any size with invasion 
into  mediastinum,  heart,  great  vessels,  trachea,  esophagus,  or  spine

or with multiple nodules in the ipsilateral lung. Lymph node staging 
depends  on  metastasis  to  ipsilateral  pulmonary  or  hilar  nodes  (N1), 
mediastinal  or  subcarinal  nodes  (N2),  or  contralateral  mediastinal, 
hilar, or supraclavicular nodes (N3). Patients with metastasis may be 
classified  as  M1a  (malignant  pleural  or  pericardial  effusion,  pleural 
nodules,  or  nodules  in  the  contralateral  lung),  M1b  (single  distant 
metastasis to a single organ; e.g., bone, liver, adrenal, or brain metas-
tasis),  or  M1c  (multiple  metastases  to  a  single  organ  or  metastases 
to  multiple  organs).  The  effect  of  stage  on  survival  is  illustrated  in  
Fig.  78-4.  Approximately  15%  of  patients  have  localized  disease  that 
can be treated with curative attempt (surgery or radiotherapy), about a 
quarter have local or regional disease that may or may not be amenable 
to a curative attempt, and half have metastatic disease at the time of 
diagnosis. In 10%, the extent of disease is undefined.
 ■ STAGING SYSTEM FOR SMALL-CELL LUNG 
CANCER
In patients with SCLC, it is now recommended that both the Veterans 
Administration system and the American Joint Committee on Cancer/
International Union Against Cancer eighth edition system (TNM) be 
used  to  classify  the  tumor  stage.  The  Veterans  Administration  sys-
tem  is  a  distinct  two-stage  system  dividing  patients  into  those  with  
limited- or extensive-stage disease. Patients with limited-stage disease 
(LD) have cancer that is confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax and can 
be encompassed within a tolerable radiation port. Thus, contralateral 
supraclavicular  nodes,  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  involvement,  and 
superior  vena  caval  obstruction  can  all  be  part  of  LD.  Patients  with 
extensive-stage  disease  (ED)  have  overt  metastatic  disease  by  imag-
ing  or  physical  examination.  Cardiac  tamponade,  malignant  pleural 
effusion, and bilateral pulmonary parenchymal involvement generally 
qualify disease as ED, because the involved organs cannot be encom-
passed safely or effectively within a single radiation therapy port. Sixty 
to 70% of patients are diagnosed with ED at presentation. The TNM 
staging  system  is  preferred  in  the  rare  SCLC  patient  presenting  with 
what appears to be clinical stage I disease (see above).
 ■ PHYSIOLOGIC STAGING
Patients with lung cancer often have other comorbid conditions related 
to  smoking  including  cardiovascular  disease  and  COPD.  To  improve 
their preoperative condition, correctable problems (e.g., anemia, elec-
trolyte and fluid disorders, infections, cardiac disease, and arrhythmias) 
should be addressed, appropriate chest physical therapy should be insti-
tuted, and patients should be encouraged to stop smoking. Patients with 
a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of >2 L or >80% of predicted 
can  tolerate  a  pneumonectomy,  and  those  with  an  FEV1  >1.5  L  have 
adequate reserve for a lobectomy. In patients with borderline lung func-
tion  but  a  resectable  tumor,  cardiopulmonary  exercise  testing  could 
be  performed  as  part  of  the  physiologic  evaluation.  This  test  allows 
an  estimate  of  the  maximal  oxygen  consumption  (Vo2max).  A  Vo2max

<15 mL/(kg.min) predicts for a higher risk of postoperative complica-
tions.  Patients  deemed  unable  to  tolerate  lobectomy  or  pneumonec-
tomy from a pulmonary functional standpoint may be candidates for 
more limited resections, such as wedge or anatomic segmental resec-
tion, although such procedures are associated with significantly higher 
rates of local recurrence and a trend toward decreased overall survival. 
All patients should be assessed for cardiovascular risk using American 
College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines. A 
myocardial infarction within the past 3 months is a contraindication 
to thoracic surgery because 20% of patients will die of reinfarction. An 
infarction  in  the  past  6  months  is  a  relative  contraindication.  Other 
major contraindications include uncontrolled arrhythmias, an FEV1 of 
<1 L, CO2 retention (resting Pco2 >45 mmHg), DLco <40%, and severe 
pulmonary hypertension.

TREATMENT
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer

The overall treatment approach to patients with NSCLC is shown 
in Fig. 78-5. 
OCCULT AND STAGE 0 CARCINOMAS
Patients with severe atypia on sputum cytology have an increased 
risk of developing lung cancer compared to those without atypia. In 
the uncommon circumstance where malignant cells are identified 
in a sputum or bronchial washing specimen but the chest imaging 
appears  normal  (TX  tumor  stage),  the  lesion  must  be  localized. 
More  than  90%  of  tumors  can  be  localized  by  meticulous  exami-
nation of the bronchial tree with a fiberoptic bronchoscope under 
general anesthesia and collection of a series of differential brushings 
and  biopsies.  Surgical  resection  following  bronchoscopic  localiza-
tion has been shown to improve survival compared to no treatment. 
Close follow-up of these patients is indicated because of the high 
incidence of second primary lung cancers (5% per patient per year). 
SOLITARY PULMONARY NODULE AND “GROUND-GLASS” 
OPACITIES
A  solitary  pulmonary  nodule  is  defined  as  an  x-ray  density  com-
pletely  surrounded  by  normal  aerated  lung  with  circumscribed 
margins,  of  any  shape,  usually  1–6  cm  in  greatest  diameter.  The 
approach  to  a  patient  with  a  solitary  pulmonary  nodule  is  based 
on an estimate of the probability of cancer, determined according 
to the patient’s smoking history, age, and characteristics on imag-
ing (Table 78-7). Prior CXRs and CT scans should be obtained if 
available for comparison. A PET scan may be useful if the lesion is 
greater than 7–8 mm in diameter. If no diagnosis is apparent, Mayo 
investigators  reported  that  clinical  characteristics  (age,  cigarette 

smoking  status,  and  prior  cancer  diagnosis)  and  three  radiologic 
characteristics (nodule diameter, spiculation, and upper lobe loca-
tion) were independent predictors of malignancy. At present, only 
two radiographic criteria are thought to predict the benign nature 
of  a  solitary  pulmonary  nodule:  lack  of  growth  over  a  period   
>2  years  and  certain  characteristic  patterns  of  calcification.  Cal-
cification  alone,  however,  does  not  exclude  malignancy;  a  dense 
central nidus, multiple punctuate foci, and “bull’s eye” (granuloma) 
and “popcorn ball” (hamartoma) calcifications are highly suggestive 
of  a  benign  lesion.  In  contrast,  a  relatively  large  lesion,  lack  of  or 
asymmetric  calcification,  chest  symptoms,  associated  atelectasis, 
pneumonitis, or growth of the lesion revealed by comparison with 
an old x-ray or CT scan or a positive PET scan may be suggestive 
of  a  malignant  process  and  warrant  further  attempts  to  establish 
a  histologic  diagnosis.  An  algorithm  for  assessing  these  lesions  is 
shown in Fig. 78-6.

Since the advent of screening CTs, small “ground-glass” opacities 
(GGOs)  have  often  been  observed,  particularly  as  the  increased 
sensitivity  of  CTs  enables  detection  of  smaller  lesions.  Many  of 
these GGOs, when biopsied, are found to be atypical adenomatous 
hyperplasia  (AAH),  adenocarcinoma  in  situ  (AIS),  or  minimally 
invasive  adenocarcinoma  (MIA).  AAH  is  usually  a  nodule  of   
<5  mm  and  is  minimally  hazy,  also  called  nonsolid  or  ground 
glass (i.e., hazy slightly increased attenuation, no solid component, 
and  preservation  of  bronchial  and  vascular  margins).  On  thin- 
section CT, AIS is usually a nonsolid nodule and tends to be slightly 
more opaque than AAH. MIA is mainly solid, usually with a small  
(<5 mm) central solid component. However, overlap exists among 
the  imaging  features  of  the  preinvasive  and  minimally  invasive 
lesions  in  the  lung  adenocarcinoma  spectrum.  Lepidic  adenocar-
cinomas are usually solid but may be nonsolid. Likewise, the small 
invasive adenocarcinomas also are usually solid but may exhibit a 
small nonsolid component. 
MANAGEMENT OF STAGES I AND II NSCLC 
Surgical  Resection  of  Stage  I  and  II  NSCLC  Surgical  resection, 
ideally  by  an  experienced  thoracic  surgeon,  is  the  treatment  of 
choice for patients with clinical stage I and II NSCLC who are able 
to  tolerate  the  procedure.  Operative  mortality  rates  for  patients 
resected by thoracic or cardiothoracic surgeons are lower compared 
to general surgeons. Moreover, survival rates are higher in patients 
who  undergo  resection  in  facilities  with  a  high  surgical  volume 
compared to those performing fewer than 70 procedures per year, 
even though the higher-volume facilities often serve older and less 
socioeconomically  advantaged  populations.  The  improvement  in 
survival  is  most  evident  in  the  immediate  postoperative  period. 
In  patients  with  stage  I  NSCLC,  lobectomy  is  superior  to  wedge

a  trend  toward  improvement  in  overall  survival.  In  patients  with 
comorbidities, compromised pulmonary reserve, and small periph-
eral lesions, a limited resection, wedge resection, or segmentectomy 
(potentially  by  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery)  may  be  rea-
sonable surgical options. Pneumonectomy is reserved for patients 
with central tumors and should be performed only in patients with 
excellent pulmonary reserve. The 5-year survival rates are 68–92% 
for patients with stage I NSCLC and 53–60% for patients with stage 
II NSCLC.

Accurate pathologic staging requires adequate segmental, hilar, 
and  mediastinal  lymph  node  sampling.  Ideally,  this  includes  a 
mediastinal lymph node dissection. On the right side, mediastinal 
stations 2R, 4R, 7, 8R, and 9R should be dissected; on the left side, 
stations 5, 6, 7, 8L, and 9L should be dissected. Hilar lymph nodes 
are typically resected and sent for pathologic review, although it is 
helpful to specifically dissect and label level 10 lymph nodes when 
possible.  On  the  left  side,  level  2  and  sometimes  level  4  lymph 
nodes are generally obscured by the aorta. Although the therapeutic 
benefit of nodal dissection versus nodal sampling is controversial, 
a pooled analysis of three trials involving patients with stages I to 
IIIA  NSCLC  demonstrated  a  superior  4-year  survival  in  patients 
undergoing resection and a complete mediastinal lymph node dis-
section compared with lymph node sampling. Moreover, complete 
mediastinal lymphadenectomy added little morbidity to a pulmo-
nary resection for lung cancer when carried out by an experienced 
thoracic surgeon. 

Radiation  Therapy  in  Stages  I  and  II  NSCLC  There  is  currently 
no  role  for  postoperative  radiation  therapy  in  patients  following 
resection of stage I or II NSCLC with negative margins. However, 
patients  with  stage  I  and  II  disease  who  either  refuse  or  are  not 
suitable candidates for surgery should be considered for radiation 
therapy  with  curative  intent.  Stereotactic  body  radiation  therapy 
(SBRT) is a technique used to treat patients with isolated pulmo-
nary nodules (≤5 cm) who are not candidates for or refuse surgical 
resection.  Treatment  is  typically  administered  in  three  to  five

fractions delivered over 1–2 weeks. In uncontrolled studies, disease 
control rates are >90%, and 5-year survival rates of up to 60% have 
been  reported  with  SBRT.  By  comparison,  survival  rates  typically 
range from 13 to 39% in patients with stage I or II NSCLC treated 
with standard external-beam radiotherapy. Cryoablation is another 
technique  occasionally  used  to  treat  small,  isolated  tumors  (i.e.,   
≤3 cm). However, very little data exist on long-term outcomes with 
this technique. 

Chemotherapy  in  Stages  I  and  II  NSCLC  Although  a  landmark 
meta-analysis  of  cisplatin-based  adjuvant  chemotherapy  trials  in 
patients  with  resected  stages  I  to  IIIA  NSCLC  (the  Lung  Adjuvant 
Cisplatin Evaluation [LACE] Study) demonstrated a 5.4% improve-
ment  in  5-year  survival  for  adjuvant  chemotherapy  compared  to 
surgery alone, the survival benefit was seemingly confined to patients 
with  stage  II  or  III  disease  (Table  78-8).  By  contrast,  survival  was 
actually worsened in stage IA patients with the application of adju-
vant therapy. In stage IB, there was a modest improvement in survival 
of  questionable  clinical  significance.  Adjuvant  chemotherapy  was 
also detrimental in patients with poor performance status (Eastern 
Cooperative  Oncology  Group  [ECOG]  performance  status  =  2). 
These  data  suggest  that  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  best  applied  in 
patients with resected stage II or III NSCLC. There is no apparent 
role for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected stage IA 
or  IB  NSCLC.  A  possible  exception  to  the  prohibition  of  adju-
vant therapy in this setting is the stage IB patient with a resected 

lesion ≥4 cm. Osimertinib, an EGFR TKI, demonstrated improved 
disease-free  survival  for  patients  with  EGFR  mutation  (exon  19 
deletion  or  L858R)–positive  NSCLC  treated  for  3  years  following 
chemotherapy. However, the effect on overall survival is unknown.
As with any treatment recommendation, the risks and benefits 
of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  should  be  considered  on  an  individual 
patient basis. If a decision is made to proceed with adjuvant che-
motherapy,  in  general,  treatment  should  be  initiated  6–12  weeks 
after surgery, assuming the patient has fully recovered, and should 
be  administered  for  no  more  than  four  cycles.  Although  cis-
platin-based  chemotherapy  is  the  preferred  treatment  regimen, 
carboplatin  can  be  substituted  for  cisplatin  in  patients  who  are 
unlikely  to  tolerate  cisplatin  for  reasons  such  as  reduced  renal 
function, presence of neuropathy, or hearing impairment. A large 
cooperative  group  trial  compared  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy 
with  vinorelbine,  pemetrexed,  gemcitabine,  or  docetaxel  with  or 
without antiangiogenic therapy. While adding antiangiogenic ther-
apy  to  platinum-based  chemotherapy  offered  no  benefit,  the  trial 
also demonstrated no difference in survival among the four chemo-
therapy regimens. Therefore, no specific chemotherapy regimen is 
considered superior in this setting, and treatment selection may be 
based on cost and patient comorbidities.

Neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  which  is  the  application  of  chemo-
therapy administered before an attempted surgical resection, has been 
advocated by some experts on the assumption that such an approach 
will more effectively extinguish occult micrometastases compared to

postoperative  chemotherapy.  In  addition,  it  is  thought  that  preop-
erative chemotherapy might render an inoperable lesion resectable. 
A meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials involving more 
than 2300 patients with stage I to III NSCLC suggested there may be 
a modest 5-year survival benefit (i.e., ∼5%) that is virtually identical 
to  the  survival  benefit  achieved  with  postoperative  chemotherapy. 
Accordingly, neoadjuvant therapy may prove useful in selected cases 
(see  below).  A  decision  to  use  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  should 
always be made in consultation with an experienced surgeon.

All patients with resected NSCLC are at high risk of developing 
a second primary lung cancer or recurrence, most of which occur 
within  18–24  months  of  surgery.  Thus,  it  is  reasonable  to  follow 
these  patients  with  periodic  imaging  studies.  Given  the  results  of 
the  NLST,  periodic  CT  scans  appear  to  be  the  most  appropriate 
screening modality. Based on the timing of most recurrences, some 
guidelines recommend a contrasted chest CT scan every 6 months 
for the first 3 years after surgery, followed by yearly CT scans of the 
chest without contrast thereafter. 

MANAGEMENT OF STAGE III NSCLC
Management  of  patients  with  stage  III  NSCLC  usually  requires 
a  combined-modality  approach.  Patients  with  stage  IIIA  disease 
commonly  are  stratified  into  those  with  “nonbulky”  or  “bulky” 
mediastinal  lymph  node  (N2)  disease.  Although  the  definition  of 
“bulky”  N2  disease  varies  somewhat  in  the  literature,  the  usual 
criteria  include  the  size  of  a  dominant  lymph  node  (i.e.,  >2–3 
cm  in  short-axis  diameter  as  measured  by  CT),  groupings  of 
multiple  smaller  lymph  nodes,  evidence  of  extracapsular  nodal 
involvement,  or  involvement  of  more  than  two  lymph  node  sta-
tions.  The  distinction  between  nonbulky  and  bulky  stage  IIIA 
disease  is  mainly  used  to  select  potential  candidates  for  upfront 
surgical resection or for resection after neoadjuvant therapy. Many 
aspects  of  therapy  of  patients  with  stage  III  NSCLC  remain  con-
troversial, and the optimal treatment strategy has not been clearly 
defined. Furthermore, because stage III disease is highly heteroge-
neous, no single treatment approach can be recommended for all 
patients. Key factors guiding treatment choices include the partic-
ular combination of tumor (T) and nodal (N) disease, the ability to 
achieve a complete surgical resection if indicated, and the patient’s

overall physical condition and preferences. For example, in carefully 
selected  patients  with  limited  stage  IIIA  disease  where  involved 
mediastinal lymph nodes can be completed resected, initial surgery 
followed by postoperative chemotherapy (with or without radiation 
therapy) may be indicated. By contrast, for patients with clinically 
evident  bulky  mediastinal  lymph  node  involvement,  the  standard 
approach  to  treatment  is  concurrent  chemoradiotherapy  followed 
by  a  year  of  immunotherapy  with  durvalumab  or  other  PD-L1-
directed antibody. 
Absent  and  Nonbulky  Mediastinal  (N2,  N3)  Lymph  Node  Disease   
For the subset of stage IIIA patients initially thought to have clini-
cal stage I or II disease (i.e., pathologic involvement of mediastinal 
[N2] lymph nodes is not detected preoperatively), surgical resection 
is often the treatment of choice. This is followed by adjuvant che-
motherapy in patients with microscopic lymph node involvement 
in  a  resection  specimen.  Postoperative  radiation  therapy  (PORT) 
may also have a role for those with close or positive surgical mar-
gins.  Patients  with  tumors  exceeding  7  cm  in  size  or  involving 
the chest wall or proximal airways within 2 cm of the carina with 
hilar  lymph  node  involvement  (but  not  N2  disease)  are  classified 
as  having  T3N1  stage  IIIA  disease.  They  too  are  best  managed 
with surgical resection, if technically feasible, followed by adjuvant 
chemotherapy if completely resected. Patients with T3N0 or T3N1 
disease due to the presence of satellite nodules within the same lobe 
as the primary tumor are also candidates for surgery, as are patients 
with  ipsilateral  nodules  in  another  lobe  and  negative  mediastinal 
nodes  (IIIA,  T4N0  or  T4N1).  Although  data  regarding  adjuvant 
chemotherapy in the latter subsets of patients are limited, it is often 
recommended.

Patients with T4N0-1 may have involvement of the carina, supe-
rior vena cava, or a vertebral body and yet still be candidates for sur-
gical resection in selected circumstances. The decision to proceed 
with an attempted resection must be made in consultation with an 
experienced thoracic surgeon often in association with a vascular 
or cardiac surgeon and an orthopedic surgeon depending on tumor 
location. However, if an incomplete resection is inevitable or if there 
is evidence of N2 involvement (stage IIIB), surgery for T4 disease 
is contraindicated. Most T4 lesions are best treated with concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab.

The  role  of  PORT  in  patients  with  completely  resected  stage 
III  NSCLC  is  controversial.  To  a  large  extent,  the  use  of  PORT  is 
dictated  by  the  presence  or  absence  of  N2  involvement  and,  to  a 
lesser degree, by the biases of the treating physician. Using the Sur-
veillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, a recent 
meta-analysis of PORT identified a significant increase in survival 
in patients with N2 disease but not in patients with N0 or N1 dis-
ease. An earlier analysis by the PORT Meta-analysis Trialist Group 
using an older database produced similar results. 
Known Mediastinal (N2, N3) Lymph Node Disease  When patho-
logic  involvement  of  mediastinal  lymph  nodes  is  documented 
preoperatively,  a  combined-modality  approach  is  recommended 
assuming  the  patient  is  a  candidate  for  treatment  with  curative 
intent.  These  patients  are  at  high  risk  for  both  local  and  distant 
recurrence if managed with resection alone. For patients with stage 
III disease who are not candidates for surgical resection, concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy is most commonly used as the initial treatment 
followed by durvalumab. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been 
shown  to  produce  superior  survival  compared  to  sequential  che-
moradiotherapy; however, it also is associated with greater host tox-
icities (including fatigue, esophagitis, and neutropenia). Therefore, 
for patients with a good performance status, concurrent chemora-
diotherapy is the preferred treatment approach, whereas sequential 
chemoradiotherapy  may  be  more  appropriate  for  patients  with  a 
performance  status  that  is  not  as  good.  For  patients  who  are  not 
candidates for a combined-modality treatment approach, typically 
due  to  a  poor  performance  status  or  a  comorbidity  that  makes 
chemotherapy untenable, radiotherapy alone may provide a modest 
survival benefit in addition to symptom palliation.

For  patients  with  potentially  resectable  N2  disease,  it  remains 
uncertain  whether  surgery  after  neoadjuvant  chemoradiotherapy 
improves  survival.  In  an  NCI-sponsored  Intergroup  randomized 
trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone to concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy  followed  by  attempted  surgical  resection,  no 
survival benefit was observed in the trimodality arm compared to 
the bimodality therapy. In fact, patients subjected to a pneumonec-
tomy  had  a  worse  survival  outcome.  By  contrast,  those  treated 
with a lobectomy appeared to have a survival advantage based on a 
retrospective subset analysis. Thus, in carefully selected, otherwise 
healthy  patients  with  nonbulky  mediastinal  lymph  node  involve-
ment, surgery may be a reasonable option if the primary tumor can 
be fully resected with a lobectomy. This is not the case if a pneu-
monectomy is required to achieve complete resection. 
Superior  Sulcus  Tumors  (Pancoast  Tumors)  Superior  sulcus 
tumors  represent  a  distinctive  subset  of  stage  III  disease.  These 
tumors arise in the apex of the lung and may invade the second and 
third  ribs,  the  brachial  plexus,  the  subclavian  vessels,  the  stellate 
ganglion, and adjacent vertebral bodies. They also may be associ-
ated with Pancoast syndrome, characterized by pain that may arise 
in the shoulder or chest wall or radiate to the neck. Pain characteris-
tically radiates to the ulnar surface of the hand. Horner’s syndrome 
(enophthalmos, ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) due to invasion of 
the paravertebral sympathetic chain may be present as well. Patients 
with  these  tumors  should  undergo  the  same  staging  procedures 
as  all  patients  with  stage  II  and  III  NSCLC.  Neoadjuvant  chemo-
therapy  or  combined  chemoradiotherapy  followed  by  surgery  is 
reserved  for  those  without  N2  involvement.  This  approach  yields 
excellent survival outcomes (>50% 5-year survival in patients with 
an R0 resection). Patients with N2 disease are less likely to benefit 
from  surgery  and  can  be  managed  with  chemoradiotherapy  fol-
lowed by durvalumab. Patients presenting with metastatic disease 
can be treated with radiation therapy (with or without chemother-
apy) for symptom palliation. 

MANAGEMENT OF METASTATIC NSCLC
Approximately  40%  of  NSCLC  patients  present  with  advanced, 
stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis. In addition, a significant 
number of patients who first presented with early-stage NSCLC will 
eventually relapse with distant disease. Patients who have recurrent 
disease  have  a  better  prognosis  than  those  presenting  with  meta-
static  disease  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  Standard  medical  manage-
ment,  the  judicious  use  of  pain  medications,  and  the  appropriate 
use  of  radiotherapy  and  systemic  therapy—which  may  consist  of 
targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and/or traditional cytotoxic che-
motherapy  depending  on  the  specific  diagnosis  as  well  as  PD-L1 
tumor  proportion  score  (TPS)  and  molecular  subtype—form  the 
cornerstone of management. Systemic therapy palliates symptoms, 
improves  quality  of  life,  and  improves  survival  in  patients  with 
metastatic NSCLC, particularly in patients with good performance 
status. Of note, the early application of palliative care in conjunction 
with chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC is associated 
with both improved survival and quality of life. 

Targeted Therapies for Select Molecular Cohorts of NSCLC  For 
a  cohort  of  NSCLC  patients,  the  presence  of  an  oncogenic  driver 
mutation allows the use of oral therapies with significant antitumor 
activity and improved survival compared to cytotoxic chemother-
apy.  These  driver  mutations  occur  in  genes  encoding  signaling 
proteins that, when aberrant, promote the uncontrolled growth and 
metastasis of tumor cells. Importantly, driver mutations can serve 
as Achilles’ heels for tumors, if their gene products can be targeted 
therapeutically  with  small-molecule  inhibitors.  All  patients  with 
advanced  NSCLC  should  undergo  molecular  testing  with  broad 
panel-based  testing  techniques  such  as  next-generation  sequenc-
ing  (NGS)  to  look  for  oncogenic  drivers.  Mutations,  fusions,  and 
deletions have been reported in a number of genes including EGFR, 
ALK,  ROS1,  BRAF,  RET,  MET,  NTRK,  KRAS,  PIK3CA,  NRAS, 
AKT1,  and  MEK1  (MAP2K1);  however,  not  all  are  considered 

actionable at this time. As our treatment armamentarium expands, 
knowledge of these mutations is critical for selection of appropriate 
therapy.

EGFR  mutations  have  been  detected  in  10–15%  of  North   
American  patients  diagnosed  with  NSCLC.  EGFR  mutations  are 
associated with younger age, light (<10 pack-year) and nonsmok-
ers,  and  adenocarcinoma  histology.  Approximately  90%  of  these 
mutations are exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R point mutations 
within the EGFR TK domain, resulting in hyperactivation of both 
EGFR kinase activity and downstream signaling. Lung tumors that 
harbor  activating  mutations  within  the  EGFR  kinase  domain  dis-
play  high  sensitivity  to  small-molecule  EGFR  TKIs.  Osimertinib, 
erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and dacomitinib are FDA-approved oral 
small-molecule TKIs that inhibit EGFR. Several large, international, 
phase  3  studies  have  demonstrated  improved  response  rates  and 
progression-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation–positive 
NSCLC treated with an EGFR TKI as compared with standard first-
line chemotherapy regimens (Table 78-9). Osimertinib was shown 
in a randomized phase 3 trial to have superior progression-free and 
overall  survival  in  patients  with  EGFR-mutant  NSCLC  compared 
to  earlier-generation  EGFR  TKIs  (erlotinib  or  gefitinib)  and  to 
chemotherapy.

Chromosomal  rearrangements  involving  the  anaplastic  lym-
phoma  kinase  (ALK)  gene  on  chromosome  2  have  been  found 
in  ∼3–7%  of  patients  with  NSCLC.  ALK  rearrangements  lead  to 
hyperactivation  of  the  ALK  TK  domain.  Similar  to  EGFR,  ALK 
rearrangements  are  typically  (but  not  exclusively)  associated  with 
younger  age,  light  (<10  pack-year)  and  nonsmokers,  and  adeno-
carcinoma  histology.  Crizotinib  is  a  first-generation  ALK  TKI, 
whereas  alectinib,  brigatinib  and  ceritinib  are  second-generation 
ALK TKIs approved as first-line treatment options for patients with 
lung  tumors  harboring  ALK  rearrangements.  Both  alectinib  and 
brigatinib  have  been  found  to  have  superior  progression-free  sur-
vival to crizotinib, whereas lorlatinib, a third-generation ALK TKI, 
is approved in patients who progress on a second-generation ALK 
TKI (Table 78-10). ALK testing may be performed via fluorescence

in  situ  hybridization  (FISH),  immunohistochemistry  (IHC),  or 
NGS.

ROS1 fusions, detected by FISH or NGS, have been identified in 
∼1% of patients with NSCLC, and similar to EGFR mutations and 
ALK  fusions,  ROS1  rearrangements  are  typically  associated  with 
younger age and light or never smoking status. Crizotinib and lor-
latinib, which inhibit both ALK and ROS1 kinases, and entrectinib 
have been FDA approved for patients whose tumors harbor a ROS1 
fusion.

NTRK  fusions  occur  in  members  of  the  NTRK  gene  family 
(NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3) and result in constitutive protein kinase 
activation.  NTRK  fusions  are  rare,  occurring  in  <1%  of  patients 
with NSCLC. Similar to the above mutations, they more commonly 
occur in never smokers; however, patients with NTRK fusions are 
often older patient compared to those with ROS1 and ALK altera-
tions.  Entrectinib  and  larotrectinib  have  demonstrated  durable 
antitumor  efficacy  and  are  currently  approved  for  NTRK-positive 
NSCLC.

MET  exon  14  skipping  mutations  have  also  been  identified  in 
approximately  3–5%  of  patients  with  NSCLC.  Unlike  the  above-
mentioned  mutations,  MET  exon  14  skipping  mutations  occur  in 
both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC patients and those with 
a  history  of  smoking.  Pharmacologic  inhibition  of  the  overactive 
MET pathway with capmatinib or tepotinib resulted response rates 
>70%, particularly in treatment-naïve NSCLC patients.

Oncogenic  mutations  in  BRAF  have  been  observed  in  ~2%  of 
patients with NSCLC and, similar to MET, occur in both squamous 
and nonsquamous NSCLC and with an equal prevalence in patients

with a history of smoking. This mutation is typically most targetable 
when it occurs at the 600th amino acid valine (V600). Combined 
inhibition with a BRAF and MEK inhibitor, dabrafenib plus trame-
tinib, is a first-line or later therapeutic option in patients with BRAF 
V600–mutant NSCLC and appears to be superior to BRAF or MEK 
inhibition alone.

RET alterations typically occur as chromosomal rearrangements 
resulting in constitutive TKI activation. RET rearrangements may 
be  detected  by  either  FISH  or  NGS  in  ~1%  of  NSCLC  patients. 
Analogous to capmatinib, selpercatinib has demonstrated an excel-
lent  response  rate;  as  many  as  85%  of  treatment-naïve  NSCLC 
patients  with  RET  alterations  responded.  All  National  Compre-
hensive  Cancer  Network–supported  targetable  oncogenic  driver 
mutations  and  potential  therapeutic  options  are  summarized  in 
Fig. 78-7.

Mutations within the KRAS GTPase are found in ∼20% of lung 
adenocarcinomas.  Agents  targeting  KRAS  G12C  are  in  develop-
ment. Each of the other driver mutations occurs in <1–3% of lung 
adenocarcinomas.  The  great  majority  of  the  driver  mutations  are 
mutually exclusive. Most cancers have just one main driver. Defin-
ing mechanisms of acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors 
is a high research priority. 
Immunotherapy 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly 
improved the quality of life and survival for a group of patients with 
locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These agents are used pri-
marily in patients whose tumors do not express a targetable genetic 
lesion (Fig. 78-8). Immune checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking 
interactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) or 
tumor cells that lead to T-cell inactivation. By inhibiting this inter-
action,  the  immune  system  is  effectively  upregulated  and  T  cells 
become  activated  against  tumor  cells.  Several  randomized  studies 
have demonstrated superior overall survival in patients treated with 
pembrolizumab  or  atezolizumab  monotherapy  or  nivolumab  plus 
ipilimumab  combination  immunotherapy  compared  to  chemo-
therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 expression 
in  ≥50%  of  tumor  cells  (Keynote  024,  IMPOWER  110)  and  ≥1% 
of tumor cells (Keynote 042, CheckMate 227)  (Table 78-11). The 
evidence  supporting  the  use  of  single-agent  immunotherapy  in 
patients with tumor PD-L1 <50% remains unclear; current recom-
mendations suggest the use of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy 
or immunotherapy combinations as the first-line treatment strategy 
in  patients  with  metastatic  NSCLC  with  tumor  PD-L1  <50%.  As 
discussed  below,  specific  regimens  vary  by  tumor  histology  (ade-
nocarcinoma  vs  squamous  cell  carcinoma).  Although  PD-L1  has 
been identified as a biomarker that can predict response to immune 
checkpoint  inhibitors,  responses  are  observed  in  patients  who  do

not  appear  to  express  the  biomarker,  and  not  all  PD-L1-positive 
patients  respond  to  checkpoint  inhibition.  Importantly  patients 
with  driver  mutations  such  as  EGFR  and  ALK  appear  to  derive 
greater  benefit  from  targeted  therapy  than  immunotherapy  and 
should be treated with a TKI, even in the presence of high PD-L1 
expression.  Further  evaluation  of  these  agents  in  the  neoadjuvant 
setting and combined with chemoradiotherapy is ongoing. 

Cytotoxic  Chemotherapy  for  Metastatic  or  Recurrent  NSCLC   
Cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is  typically  used  in  combination  with 
immunotherapy as the initial treatment in patients with metastatic 
or  recurrent  NSCLC  only  when  there  is  no  contraindication  to 
immunotherapy. Selected chemotherapy agents perform quite dif-
ferently in squamous carcinomas versus adenocarcinomas. Patients 
with  nonsquamous  NSCLC  have  an  improved  survival  when

treated  with  cisplatin  and  pemetrexed  compared  to  cisplatin  and 
gemcitabine. By contrast, patients with squamous carcinoma have 
an improved survival when treated with cisplatin and gemcitabine. 
This survival difference is thought to be related to the differential 
expression  between  tumor  types  of  thymidylate  synthase  (TS). 
Squamous cancers have a much higher expression of TS compared 
to adenocarcinomas, accounting for their lower responsiveness to 
pemetrexed. By contrast, the activity of gemcitabine is not impacted 
by the levels of TS. 
Second-Line  Therapy  and  Beyond  Second-line  therapy  for 
advanced  NSCLC  relies  on  docetaxel;  it  improves  survival  com-
pared  to  supportive  care  alone.  Ramucirumab  is  a  recombinant 
human  IgG1  monoclonal  antibody  that  targets  VEGFR-2  and 
blocks the interaction of VEGF ligands and VEGFR-2. A phase 3 
trial  demonstrated  a  significant  improvement  in  progression-free 
survival  and  overall  survival  when  ramucirumab  was  combined 
with  docetaxel  as  second-line  therapy  in  patients  who  had  pro-
gressed  on  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  Contrary  to  bevaci-
zumab, ramucirumab was safe in patients with both squamous and 
nonsquamous NSCLC and is approved regardless of histology. 
Supportive  Care  No  discussion  of  the  treatment  strategies  for 
patients  with  advanced  lung  cancer  would  be  complete  without  a 
mention  of  supportive  care.  Coincident  with  advances  in  chemo-
therapy and targeted therapy was a pivotal study that demonstrated 
that the early integration of palliative care with standard treatment 
strategies  improves  both  quality  of  life  and  overall  survival  for 
patients with stage IV NSCLC (Chaps. 12 and 69). Aggressive pain 
and symptom control are important components of optimal treat-
ment of these patients.

TREATMENT
Small-Cell Lung Cancer

The overall treatment approach to patients with SCLC is shown in 
Fig. 78-9. 

SURGERY FOR LIMITED-DISEASE SMALL-CELL LUNG 
CANCER
SCLC  is  a  highly  aggressive  disease  characterized  by  its  rapid 
doubling  time,  high  growth  fraction,  early  development  of  dis-
seminated disease, and dramatic response to first-line chemother-
apy  and  radiation.  In  general,  surgical  resection  is  not  routinely 
recommended  for  patients  because  even  patients  with  LD-SCLC 
still have occult micrometastases. However, the American College 
of  Chest  Physicians  Evidence-Based  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines 
recommend surgical resection over nonsurgical treatment in SCLC 
patients with clinical stage I disease after a thorough evaluation for 
distant metastases and invasive mediastinal stage evaluation (grade 
2C). After resection, these patients should receive platinum-based 
adjuvant  chemotherapy  (grade  1C).  If  the  histologic  diagnosis  of 
SCLC is made in patients on review of a resected surgical specimen, 
such patients should receive standard SCLC chemotherapy as well. 
CHEMOTHERAPY
In  patients  with  limited-stage  SCLC,  concurrent  chemoradiother-
apy  with  cisplatin-etoposide  for  four  cycles  has  remained  stan-
dard  of  care  for  over  4  decades.  Two  randomized  phase  3  trials 
have demonstrated that chemotherapy with either cisplatin or car-
boplatin plus either etoposide and a PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab 
(IMPOWER  133)  or  durvalumab  (CASPIAN),  provides  superior 
progression-free  and  overall  survival  compared  to  chemotherapy 
alone, making combination therapy the preferred choice in appro-
priate patients. Despite response rates to first-line therapy as high as 
80%, the median survival ranges from 12 to 20 months for patients 
with  LD  and  approximately  12  months  for  patients  with  ED. 
Regardless  of  disease  extent,  the  majority  of  patients  relapse  and 
develop chemotherapy-resistant disease. The prognosis is especially 
poor  for  patients  who  relapse  within  the  first  3  months  of  ther-
apy; these patients are said to have chemotherapy-resistant disease. 
Patients are said to have sensitive disease if they relapse >3 months 
after their initial therapy and are thought to have a somewhat better 
overall survival. These patients also are thought to have the greatest 
potential  benefit  from  second-line  chemotherapy.  Topotecan  and

lurbinectedin are FDA-approved agents for second-line therapy in 
patients with SCLC. Topotecan has only modest activity and can be 
given either intravenously or orally; it appears to have more efficacy 
in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease. Lurbinectedin has 
a  35%  response  rate  and  progression-free  survival  of  3.5  months, 
with a greater benefit in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive dis-
ease. Other agents with similar low levels of activity in the second- 
line  setting  include  irinotecan,  paclitaxel,  docetaxel,  vinorelbine, 
oral etoposide, and gemcitabine. 
THORACIC RADIATION THERAPY
Thoracic  radiation  therapy  (TRT)  is  a  standard  component  of 
induction  therapy  for  patients  with  good  performance  status  and 
limited-stage  SCLC.  Meta-analyses  indicate  that  chemotherapy 
combined with chest irradiation improves 3-year survival by ∼5% as 
compared with chemotherapy alone. The 5-year survival rate, how-
ever,  remains  disappointingly  low  at  ∼10–15%.  Most  commonly, 
TRT is combined with cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy due to 
a superior toxicity profile as compared to anthracycline-containing 
chemotherapy regimens. As observed in locally advanced NSCLC, 
concurrent  chemoradiotherapy  is  more  effective  than  sequential 
chemoradiation but is associated with significantly more esophagi-
tis  and  hematologic  toxicity.  Ideally  TRT  should  be  administered 
with the first two cycles of chemotherapy because later application 
appears slightly less effective. If for reasons of fitness or availability, 
this regimen cannot be offered, TRT should follow induction che-
motherapy. With respect to fractionation of TRT, twice-daily 1.5-Gy 
fractioned  radiation  therapy  has  been  shown  to  improve  survival 
in  LD-SCLC  patients  but  is  associated  with  higher  rates  of  grade 
3  esophagitis  and  pulmonary  toxicity.  Although  it  is  feasible  to 
deliver once-daily radiation therapy doses up to 70 Gy concurrently 
with  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy,  there  are  no  data  to  support 
equivalency  of  this  approach  compared  with  the  45-Gy  twice-
daily  radiotherapy  dose.  Therefore,  the  current  standard  regimen 
of  a  45-Gy  dose  administered  in  1.5-Gy  fractions  twice  daily  for   
30 days is being compared with higher-dose regimens in two phase 3  
trials, one in the United States and one in Europe. Patients should 
be carefully selected for concurrent chemoradiation therapy based 
on good performance status and adequate pulmonary reserve. The 
role  of  radiotherapy  in  ED-SCLC  is  largely  restricted  to  pallia-
tion of tumor-related symptoms such as bone pain and bronchial 
obstruction. 
PROPHYLACTIC CRANIAL IRRADIATION
Prophylactic  cranial  irradiation  (PCI)  should  be  considered  in  all 
patients either with LD-SCLC or who have responded well to initial 
therapy;  its  role  in  patients  with  ED-SCLC  is  more  controversial. 
A  meta-analysis  including  seven  trials  and  987  patients  with  LD- 
SCLC who had achieved a complete remission after upfront chemo-
therapy yielded a 5.4% improvement in overall survival for patients 
treated with PCI. In patients with ED-SCLC who have responded 
to first-line chemotherapy and had no CNS disease, patients ran-
domized to observation had a higher incidence of brain metastases; 
however,  use  of  PCI  did  not  improve  overall  survival.  Long-term 
toxicities, including deficits in cognition, have been reported after 
PCI but are difficult to sort out from the effects of chemotherapy 
or normal aging.

 ■ THYMIC TUMORS
Thymic  tumors  are  rare  malignancies  accounting  for  0.5–1.5%  of  all 
malignancies in the United States with a higher incidence among Asian 
populations.  They  are  particularly  rare  among  children  and  young 
adults  with  incidence  peaking  in  the  fifth  decade  of  life.  There  is  no 
difference between sexes, and no clear risk factors have been identified.

 ■ CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
The  majority  of  thymic  tumors  occur  in  the  anterior  mediastinum. 
Approximately  40%  of  patients  with  mediastinal  masses  will  be 

asymptomatic with an incidental finding on chest imaging. In patients 
presenting  with  an  anterior  mediastinal  mass,  if  appropriate,  serum 
β-human  chorionic  gonadotropin  (HCG)  and  α  fetoprotein  (AFP) 
should be sent to rule out a germ cell tumor. A patient with a sign or 
symptom  of  thymoma  or  thymic  carcinoma  may  present  with  chest 
pain,  dyspnea,  cough,  or  superior  vena  cava  syndrome  secondary 
to  effects  on  adjacent  organs  or  a  paraneoplastic  syndrome,  most 
commonly  myasthenia  gravis,  pure  red  cell  aplasia,  or  hypogamma-
globulinemia.  More  rare  paraneoplastic  syndromes  include  limbic 
encephalitis,  aplastic  anemia,  hemolytic  anemia,  and  autoimmune 
disease such as Sjögren’s syndrome, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
and ulcerative colitis, among others.

 ■ STAGING
Given the rarity of the tumor, patients with suspected thymoma should 
be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including a surgeon, medical 
and radiation oncologist, and pathologist with experience in treating 
the disease. A CT scan of the chest with contrast is recommended to 
determine if the mass is resectable based on relationship to surround-
ing  structures.  An  MRI  with  contrast  may  be  performed  if  clinically 
indicated.  A  PET  scan  may  be  useful  in  the  evaluation  of  a  patient 
with  thymic  tumors,  although  it  may  be  less  useful  in  the  staging  of 
thymoma  compared  to  thymic  carcinoma.  A  core  needle  biopsy  is 
considered standard of care for obtaining a histologic diagnosis of an 
anterior mediastinal tumor. This may be obtained via CT or ultrasound 
imaging. However, in some circumstances, a mediastinoscopy or open 
biopsy may be required.

Thymomas  are  commonly  staged  using  the  Masaoka  system  or 
the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  staging  system,  as  described 
in  Table  78-12.  WHO  types  A,  AB,  and  B1  tend  to  be  more  well- 
differentiated, types B2 and B3 are moderately differentiated, and type 
C is poorly differentiated.

 ■ TREATMENT
Surgical  resection  is  the  mainstay  of  treatment  for  patients  with  
Masaoka  type  I  and  II  thymic  tumors.  In  patients  with  type  III  and 
IV  who  have  potentially  resectable  thymic  tumors,  neoadjuvant  che-
motherapy  may  be  given  to  decrease  the  tumor  size  and  allow  for  a 
resection  with  negative  margins.  Surgery  remains  controversial  and 
provides a limited role in the treatment of stage III and IV disease. No

additional therapy may be required in patients with type I who have a 
resection with negative margins. Postoperative radiation therapy may 
be recommended based on extracapsular extension and the presence of 
positive margins in patients with type II or III thymic tumors or histo-
logic evaluation WHO B3 and C. Radiation therapy may be beneficial 
in patients with locally advanced disease (type III or IV) or in patients 
with symptoms secondary to compression of surrounding structures. 
Chemotherapy  with  cisplatin,  doxorubicin,  and  cyclophosphamide 
(CAP) remains the mainstay of therapy in the neoadjuvant and adju-
vant  setting  as  well  as  first-line  therapy  in  patients  with  metastatic 
thymoma,  whereas  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  are  often  employed  in 
patients  with  thymic  carcinoma.  Limited  additional  agents  are  rec-
ommended based on small phase 2 trials as second-line therapy and 
beyond.

COVID-19 AND LUNG CANCER
COVID-19,  a  respiratory  tract  infection  caused  by  SARS-CoV-2, 
emerged  in  Wuhan,  China,  in  late  2019.  The  rapid  global  spread  led 
the  WHO  to  declare  a  pandemic  in  early  March  2020.  Large  retro-
spective  data  sets  have  shown  that  cancer  patients,  and  particularly 
patients with lung cancer, are at increased risk of morbidity and mor-
tality  from  COVID-19.  The  dilemma  of  distinguishing  COVID-19 
symptoms from lung cancer and radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia 
or  pneumonitis  from  radiation  therapy  or  immunotherapy  versus 
COVID-19 pneumonia has presented a particular challenge to health 
care providers. Mortality as high as 35% has been reported for patients 
with lung cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients (≥65 years 
old),  patients  with  a  worse  performance  status  (Eastern  Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status ≥1), patients on glucocorticoids 
(≥10 mg prednisone equivalent) and anticoagulation, and patients on 
chemotherapy within 3 months of diagnosis appear to be particularly 
at risk for morality if infected. The long-term impact on lung cancer 
mortality due to delays in screening, diagnosis, and treatment are likely 
to be felt for years to come.

SUMMARY
The management of SCLC and NSCLC has undergone major change in 
the past decade, resulting in a reduction in lung cancer mortality. For 
patients with early-stage disease, advances in radiotherapy and surgical 
procedures  as  well  as  new  systemic  therapies  have  greatly  improved 
prognosis in all diseases. For patients with advanced lung cancer, major 
progress in understanding tumor genetics and tumor immunology has 
led to the development of rational targets and specific inhibitors, which 
have documented efficacy in specific subsets of NSCLC. Furthermore, 
increased understanding of how to activate the immune system to drive 
antitumor immunity has proven to be a successful therapeutic strategy 
for  a  subset  of  patients  with  advanced  lung  cancer.  However,  only  a 
small subset of patients responds to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 
the majority of patients treated with targeted therapies or chemother-
apy  eventually  develop  resistance,  which  provides  strong  motivation 
for  further  research  and  enrollment  of  patients  onto  clinical  trials  in 
this rapidly evolving area.

79 Breast Cancer

Daniel F. Hayes, Marc E. Lippman

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
 ■ CONCEPTUAL AND BIOLOGICAL ISSUES OF 
BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer is a malignant proliferation of epithelial cells lining the 
ducts or lobules of the breast. In the year 2020, approximately a quarter 
million  cases  of  invasive  and  61,000  cases  of  in  situ  breast  cancer  were 
diagnosed  in  the  United  States,  with  nearly  41,000  deaths.  Epithelial 
malignancies  of  the  breast  are  the  most  common  cause  of  cancer  in 
women (excluding skin cancer), accounting for about one-third of all can-
cer in women. As a result of earlier detection and improved treatments, 
the mortality rate from breast cancer decreased by more than one-third 
over the past three decades in high- and middle-income countries. This 
chapter does not consider rare malignancies presenting in the breast, such 
as sarcomas and lymphomas, but focuses on the epithelial cancers.

Breast cancer has served as a paradigm for several oncologic prin-
ciples  related  to  solid  tumors.  It  spans  a  spectrum  of  conditions  for 
which  different  clinical  considerations  must  be  made,  including  risk 
assessment, prevention, screening, evaluation of breast abnormalities, 
local and adjuvant systemic treatments, metastatic therapies, and sur-
vivorship issues (Fig. 79-1).

The unique biology of breast cancer has rendered it amenable to a 
variety of therapeutic “targeted” strategies based on the appreciation of 
differences in subtypes that reflect the need for differences in assess-
ment and therapy. These subtypes include expression of the estrogen 
receptor (ER) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 
(HER2), as well as germline or somatic mutations in inherited tumor 
suppressor  genes,  such  as  BRCA1  and  BRCA2.  Identifiable  somatic 
mutations  in  genes  that  appear  to  drive  the  cancer,  including  mam-
malian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR),  cyclin-dependent  kinase  4  and 
6  (CDK4/6),  and  S-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate  3-kinase

FIGURE 79-1  Breast cancer continuum conceptual model. Most breast cancers begin in epithelial cells within the lobules or ducts. They proceed through a continuum of 
atypia and hyperplasia to in situ malignancy to invasion into surrounding normal tissues followed by intravasation into lymph and blood channels to local lymph nodes and 
distant organs, culminating in distant metastases. This is a conceptual model. Not all metastatic breast cancers have progressed through these stages, and many lesions 
do not progress to the next.

Palliative treatment

catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) make it susceptible to specific thera-
peutic interventions directed against each of these targets (Table 79-1). 
Furthermore, immune checkpoint inhibition has been applied to spe-
cific types of breast cancers.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
 ■ CLINICAL, HORMONAL, AND OTHER 
NONGENETIC RISK FACTORS
Seventy-five  percent  of  all  breast  cancers  occur  in  women  aged  
>50 years, but breast cancer is not uncommon in women in their forties 
and can occur in women in their thirties and even twenties, and very 
rarely in adolescence.

Breast  cancer  is  principally  a  sex  hormone–dependent  disease 
through  increased  activity  of  the  ER  and  its  ligands,  estradiol  and 
estrone  (Fig.  79-1,  Table  79-1).  Indeed,  the  female-to-male  ratio  is 
~150:1.  Relative  exposure  to  both  endogenous  and  exogenous  estro-
gens increases risk of breast cancer. Risk of developing breast cancer 
is higher in women with early menarche (<12 years) and late first full-
term pregnancy (>35 years), and it is increased by exogenous hormone 
replacement therapy. Women without functioning ovaries, who experi-
ence an early menopause, or who never receive combination estrogen/
progesterone  replacement  therapy  are  much  less  likely  to  develop 
breast cancer than those who have a normal menstrual history. Also, 
duration of maternal nursing correlates with substantial risk reduction 
independent of either parity or age at first full-term pregnancy.

Menstrual  and  reproductive  history  accounts  for  70–80%  of  the 
variation in breast cancer frequency in different countries, providing 
insight into hormonal carcinogenesis. A woman living to age 80 years 
in  North  America  has  a  one  in  nine  chance  of  developing  invasive 
breast cancer. Women who live in agrarian societies, especially in Asia, 
have traditionally had only 1/5th to 1/10th the risk of breast cancer of 

women in North America or Western Europe. However, Asian women 
who immigrate to North America or European countries during pread-
olescence or in adolescence have the same risk as women born in these 
countries.  Further,  with  shifts  from  agrarian  to  industrialized  eco-
nomic systems, the incidence of breast cancer has risen dramatically in 
Asia, approaching that observed in Western nations.

Exogenous use of female hormones also plays a role in breast can-
cer incidence. The elevated risk related to oral contraceptives is quite 
modest if present at all. Regardless, this risk is more than balanced by 
avoidance of an undesired pregnancy and a substantial protective effect 
against ovarian epithelial and endometrial cancers.

Hormone  replacement  therapy  (HRT)  with  conjugated  equine 
estrogens plus progestins increases the risk of breast cancer; 6–7 years 
of HRT nearly doubles the risk of breast cancer and also increases the 
incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. However, it decreases the 
risk of bone fractures and colorectal cancer. On balance, more negative 
than positive events are associated with HRT. Administration of con-
jugated  estrogens  is  usually  combined  with  companion  progesterone 
to  abrogate  the  increased  risk  of  endometrial  cancer  with  estrogen 
alone. However, single-agent estrogen replacement therapy in women 
who  have  had  hysterectomies  produces  no  significant  increase  in 
breast cancer incidence and, if anything, reduces the risk. Thus, there 
are serious concerns about long-term HRT, especially in combination 
with progestins, in terms of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. 
No comparable safety data are available for other less potent forms of 
estrogen replacement, such as bioequivalent estrogen found in soy, and 
they should not be routinely used as substitutes. Epidemiologic studies 
demonstrate a rapid decrease in elevated breast cancer incidence coin-
cident with discontinuation of HRT.

HRT in women previously diagnosed with breast cancer, especially 
of the subtype that expresses ERs, counteracts much of the effectiveness 
of antineoplastic endocrine therapies and is contraindicated. Although

intravaginal  estrogen  therapy  has  been  used  for  atrophic  vaginitis 
associated  with  antiestrogenic  endocrine  therapies,  it  does  result  in 
some absorption and systemic estrogenic effects and should generally 
be avoided.

In addition to sex, age, and hormonal exposure, other risk features 
for breast cancer have been identified, but none with the kind of rela-
tive, attributable, or absolute risks associated with these three factors. 
Various differences in diets (including Asian agrarian vs modern eco-
nomic) have been implicated as risk factors, although the role of diet in 
breast cancer etiology is controversial. Associative links exist between 
breast cancer risk and total caloric and fat intake, or even specific types 
of caloric intake, but the exact role of fat in the diet is unproven and 
may actually intersect with menstrual history and estrogenic exposure.
Central  obesity,  metabolic  syndrome,  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus 
are all risk factors for occurrence and recurrence of breast cancer. Mod-
erate alcohol intake also increases the risk by an unknown mechanism. 
Folic acid supplementation appears to modify risk in women who use 
alcohol but is not additionally protective in abstainers. Recommenda-
tions favoring abstinence from alcohol must be weighed against other 
social  pressures  and  the  possible  cardioprotective  effect  of  moderate 
alcohol intake. Depression is also associated with both occurrence and 
recurrence of breast cancer.

Certain benign breast pathologic findings, such as atypical hyperpla-
sia and radial scars, are associated with higher risk of subsequent breast 
cancers. Prior radiation is a risk factor, but principally when delivered in 
adolescence or early child-bearing ages. Women who have been exposed 
before  age  30  years  to  radiation  in  the  form  of  multiple  fluoroscopies 
(200–300 cGy) or treatment for Hodgkin’s disease (>3600 cGy) have a 
substantial increase in risk of breast cancer, whereas radiation exposure 
after age 30 years appears to have a minimal carcinogenic effect on the 
breast. Radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid disease is not associated 
with increased risk of breast cancer, whereas mediastinal radiation in 
younger  women  for  lymphoma  is  a  powerful  risk  factor  within  the 
radiated field.

 ■ INHERITED GERMLINE SUSCEPTIBILITY 
FACTORS 

Family history has long been recognized as a risk factor for breast 
cancer. A woman with a first-degree history (mother or sister) of 
breast  cancer  has  an  increased  relative  risk  of  approximately 
30–50% (or one-third to one-half higher) over a woman with no family 
history. However, family history only accounts for 10–15% of all breast 
cancers. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have a strong 
family  history.  For  women  without  an  identifiable  inherited  genetic

abnormality, it is not clear whether the increased risk associated with 
family  history  is  due  to  environmental  causes  or  as  yet  unidentified 
genetic abnormalities.

The  genetics  of  breast  cancer  require  an  understanding  of  the 
distinction  between  inherited,  germline  genetic  differences  among 
individuals and acquired, somatic genetic changes within cancers. The 
former are often called mutations but are more properly termed single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Some SNPs are synonymous, mean-
ing they do not change the encoded amino acid in the affected protein 
product, and therefore are of no clinical significance. Some SNPs are 
nonsynonymous  but  may  lead  to  a  substituted  amino  acid  that  does 
not change the function of the protein, and they are likewise clinically 
insignificant. However, if an SNP leads to an amino acid substitution 
that alters the protein function or results in complete cessation of tran-
scription  or  translation  (a  “stop”  codon),  it  is  considered  deleterious 
and leads to higher susceptibility to developing cancer. In some cases, 
the significance of the SNP is unknown, and these are designated vari-
ants of undetermined significance (VUS).

The genes of interest serve, in the normal cell, to suppress expan-
sion of a potentially malignant clone, either by repairing downstream 
randomly occurring somatic genetic abnormalities or, if not possible, 
by  inducing  programmed  cell  death,  or  apoptosis.  Somatic  genetic 
changes  that  are  not  inherited,  including  mutations,  amplifications, 
insertions, deletions, translocations, and others, are responsible for the 
malignant  behavior  of  a  cancer,  including  unrestrained  proliferation, 
as well as extravasation from one site and migration and establishment 
of  metastases  into  another.  As  discussed  below,  some  germline  and 
somatic mutations can be exploited therapeutically (Table 79-1).

For most women, the increased risk associated with a family mem-
ber who has had breast cancer appears to be related to both a weak, and 
probably  multigene,  germline  susceptibility  and  similar  exposure  to 
environmental/lifestyle risk factors. Only approximately 10% of human 
breast  cancers  can  be  linked  directly  to  a  single  inherited  germline 
SNP. However, when one is present, the relative and absolute risks for 
that individual developing breast, and other, cancers in her lifetime are 
extraordinary.

The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, located on chromosomal loci 17q21 
and  13q12,  respectively,  are  the  best  characterized  breast  cancer  sus-
ceptibility genes and have the greatest clinical importance in assessing 
genetic risk for breast cancer. Women who inherit mutated alleles of 
these genes from either parent have at least a 60–80% lifetime chance 
of  developing  breast  cancer  and  about  a  33%  chance  of  developing 
ovarian cancer. The cancers that arise within a BRCA1-mutated patient 
are  almost  exclusively  negative  for  ER,  progesterone  receptor  (PgR), 
and HER2 (so-called “triple-negative” breast cancers). Men who carry 
a mutant allele of the gene have an increased incidence of breast and 
also  prostate  cancers,  although  the  absolute  risk  of  breast  cancer  in 
men with BRCA2 germline SNPs is far lower than that for women who 
harbor them.

Overall, <1% of the general population and <5% of all patients with 
breast  cancer  harbor  deleterious  SNPs  in  BRCA1  or  BRCA2.  Certain 
subgroups  of  women  are  more  likely  to  have  BRCA1/2  mutations. 
The  incidence  is  approximately  2%  in  women  of  Ashkenazi,  Eastern 
European descent. Approximately 20% of women with triple-negative 
breast cancers will be positive for deleterious germline BRCA1 SNPs, 
and genetic testing is warranted in most patients with triple-negative 
breast cancer even without a family history.

In contrast to those that arise in BRCA1 carriers, cancers that arise 
in BRCA2 contexts are more likely to be ER positive. The incidence of 
BRCA2  mutations  is  much  higher  than  BRCA1  in  men  who  develop 
breast  cancer.  However,  most  male  breast  cancer  cases  do  not  occur 
in BRCA1/2-mutated men, and the risk of breast cancer in men who 
do carry the BRCA2 mutation is much lower than that in women with 
this  genetic  abnormality.  Many  other  inherited  germline  mutations 
in  known  or  putative  tumor-suppressor  genes,  such  as  p53  (which 
also accounts in part for the Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome), 
PTEN  (which  accounts  for  Cowden’s  syndrome),  and  PALB1,  have 
now been identified as important tumor-suppressor genes with clinical 
implications.

Inherited germline mutations are readily detected in blood tests of 
normal circulating leukocytes using so-called “panel” assays, which at 
present provide results from 30–45 different germline genes. However, 
because  the  rate  of  deleterious  germline  SNPS  in  these  genes  in  the 
general population is quite low (well below 1%), germline panel genetic 
testing of the entire population of women is not recommended. Fur-
ther, results are confounded by the presence of VUS in known tumor-
suppressor genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, or deleterious variants 
or VUS in genes that are putative, but not proven, tumor-suppressor 
genes. Such results lead to confusion, anxiety, and inappropriate pre-
ventive strategies, such as prophylactic surgery, in individuals who may 
not actually be at higher risk.

Consensus guidelines on who should be tested include any woman 
with  a  family  member  who  has  been  tested  and  found  to  harbor  a 
deleterious  SNP  in  a  germline  tumor-suppressor  gene.  Testing  is 
indicated  for  any  breast  cancer  patient  with  a  triple-negative  breast 
cancer, who is <40 years old, who has synchronous or metachronous 
contralateral  breast  cancers,  who  has  a  personal  history  of  ovarian 
cancer,  or  who  has  a  first-degree  relative  (mother,  father,  or  sister) 
with breast or ovarian cancer. All males with breast cancer should be 
tested.  Some  guidelines  suggest  testing  any  breast  cancer  patient  of 
Ashkenazi descent. Patients with these mutations should be counseled 
appropriately.

Some  experts  have  recommended  testing  any  patient  diagnosed 
with breast cancer, both for genetic counseling but also because of the 
advent of effective therapies directed toward cancers that have delete-
rious BRCA1/2 mutations (Table 79-1), although this strategy remains 
controversial. Regardless, any patient who is found to have inherited 
germline  deleterious  SNPs  should  receive  formal  genetic  testing  and 
counseling  about  special  screening  and  prevention  measures  they 
might take.

PREVENTION OF BREAST CANCER
One  major  reason  to  determine  risk  would  be  to  efficiently  apply 
prevention  and/or  screening  strategies,  if  either  has  been  shown  to 
be  effective  for  the  disease  of  interest.  At  present,  although  diet  and 
exercise  are  certainly  recommended  approaches  to  healthy  living, 
none has been proven to specifically decrease a woman’s risk of breast 
cancer.  Avoidance  of  combined  estrogen/progestin  HRT  reduces  the 
associated increased risk of breast cancer to that of an average woman 
not using HRT.

Prophylactic  removal  of  the  breasts  is  an  effective,  albeit  drastic, 
preventive  strategy.  Bilateral  prophylactic  mastectomies  reduce  the 
risk of breast cancer incidence and mortality by >95%. Because breasts 
are not encapsulated organs, some normal breast tissue is always left 
behind, and therefore, women who elect to have prophylactic mastec-
tomies should be counseled that they still have some risk of developing 
a new breast cancer. Prophylactic mastectomy is most often chosen by 
women with germline genetic risk, in whom there is evidence of mor-
tality reduction. For women with average or only mildly elevated risks, 
such as diagnosis of a unilateral breast cancer, survival is not increased 
by prophylactic mastectomy, and, because of its obvious adverse effect 
on sexuality, cosmesis, and breast-feeding, this approach is not consid-
ered appropriate.

So-called  “chemoprevention”  to  lower  breast  cancer  risk  can  be 
achieved  with  therapies  directed  toward  the  ER/estrogen  signaling 
pathway  (Table  79-1).  These  include  the  selective  estrogen  receptor 
modulators (SERMs) as well as aromatase inhibition. The latter should 
only  be  applied  in  postmenopausal  women,  since  aromatase  inhibi-
tion can result in a paradoxical increase in circulating estrogen levels 
in  women  with  functioning  ovaries.  Chemoprevention  with  SERMs 
or  aromatase  inhibition  lowers  risk  of  ER-positive  breast  cancer  by 
approximately  one-half,  although  it  has  no  effect  on  the  more  lethal 
ER-negative breast cancers. Of interest, prophylactic bilateral oopho-
rectomy  and  salpingo-oophorectomy,  which  are  often  performed  in 
women with high genetic risk (such as those with inherited BRCA1/2 
deleterious  SNPs),  also  reduce  breast  cancer  in  addition  to  ovarian 
cancer risk.

PART 4Oncology and HematologySCREENING FOR BREAST CANCER (FIG. 79-2)
Screening  mammography  results  in  earlier  diagnosis  and  subsequent 
local  and  systemic  therapy.  Overviews  of  nine  prospective  random-
ized clinical trials demonstrate that screening mammography reduces 
breast  cancer  mortality  by  one-fifth  to  one-quarter  in  women  aged 
≥50 years. The relative reduction in breast cancer mortality for women 
between ages 40 and 50 years is similar, although the absolute numbers 
of women who benefit in this age group is smaller since the incidence 
of  breast  cancer  is  much  lower  in  younger  women.  In  addition  to 
reducing breast cancer mortality, screening mammography and early 
detection are more likely to identify tumors at a stage more appropriate 
for  conservative  local  therapy.  Better  technology,  including  digitized 
mammography,  tomosynthesis,  routine  use  of  magnified  views,  and 
greater skill in interpretation, have all improved the accuracy of mam-
mography.  Magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  has  higher  sensitivity 
but lower specificity than mammography. Since none of these newer 
technologies has been shown to be superior to mammography in terms 
of mortality reduction, screening of women with standard risk by any 
technique other than mammography is not recommended.

The issue of screening breast imaging of any sort has been controver-
sial.  Although  the  prospective  randomized  clinical  trials  demonstrate 
a  late  reduction  in  breast  cancer  mortality,  they  do  not  demonstrate 

improvement  in  overall  survival.  Further,  many  authors  have  raised 
concern about diagnosis of cancers that may be biologically insignifi-
cant, raising the specter of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Moreover, 
the substantial advances in both local and systemic therapies for breast 
cancer  may  have  reduced  the  benefit  of  earlier  diagnosis  provided 
by  screening.  In  contrast,  in  countries  that  have  adopted  widespread 
screening  programs,  nonrandomized,  epidemiologic  studies  have 
demonstrated even greater magnitude reductions in breast cancer mor-
tality  than  those  seen  in  the  randomized  trials.  Taken  together,  these 
data have led most guideline bodies to recommend annual screening for 
women aged 50–70 years. Many have also recommended screening for 
women in the 40- to 50-year-old range. For older women, caregiver and 
patient judgment should be used, taking into account comorbidities.

Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  is  recommended  for  women 
with  particularly  dense  breasts,  women  whose  first  cancer  was  not 
detected  by  mammography,  women  with  an  axillary  breast  cancer 
presentation but no definable breast mass on physical exam or mam-
mography, and those with high genetic risk, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 
carriers  or  those  with  Li-Fraumeni,  Cowden’s,  or  Bannayan-Riley- 
Ruvalcaba syndromes. MRI might also be considered for women with a 
history of radiation therapy to the chest between ages 10 and 30 years. 
In these women, the positive predictive value of MRI is higher because

of the higher incidence of cancer, and furthermore, many of them are 
considering prophylactic mastectomy as an alternative; therefore, the 
lower specificity and risk of a false-positive finding has been consid-
ered more acceptable.

Self-examination or physical breast examinations done by a health 
professional  have  poor  sensitivity  and  specificity,  and  regular  breast 
self-examination is not recommended. Nonetheless, all women should 
be familiar with how their breasts normally look and feel and report any 
changes to a health care provider right away. Because the breasts are a 
common  site  of  potentially  fatal  malignancy  in  women,  examination 
of the breast is an important part of a routine physical examination.

Screening breast imaging is not recommended for men, since it is 
so unusual and easily detected. It is important to note that unilateral 
lesions should be evaluated in the same manner as in women with an 
appropriately high index of suspicion.

EVALUATION OF BREAST MASSES  
(FIG. 79-2)
Virtually  all  breast  cancer  is  diagnosed  by  biopsy  of  an  abnormality 
detected  either  on  a  mammogram  or  by  palpation.  The  presence  or 
absence  of  any  risk  factors,  such  as  age,  family  history,  or  menstrual 
history  cannot  be  used  to  exclude  more  careful  workup  and,  if  indi-
cated,  a  biopsy.  Any  woman  with  a  persistent  breast  abnormality 
should be referred to an experienced breast diagnostician in order to 
avoid delay in diagnosis and therapy.

 ■ PALPABLE BREAST MASSES
Proper attention needs to be given to any abnormality either discov-
ered by the patient or appreciated by the health care provider during 
examination. Most newly diagnosed breast cancers are asymptomatic. 
Lesions with certain clinical features, including firmness, irregularity, 
tethering or fixation to the underlying chest wall, and dermal erythema 
or peau d’orange (skin edema with pockmarking), are very worrisome 
for breast cancer. In contrast, painful masses and those that are cystic 
on  physical  examination  are  less  likely  malignant.  However,  none  of 
these has a high positive or negative predictive value. Likewise, a neg-
ative mammogram in the presence of a persistent lump in the breast 
does not exclude malignancy and, again, deserves careful workup.

In  premenopausal  women,  lesions  that  are  either  equivocal  or 
nonsuspicious  on  physical  examination  should  be  reexamined  in  
2–4 weeks during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Days 5–7 
of the cycle are the best time for breast examination. A dominant mass 
in a postmenopausal woman or a dominant mass that persists through 
a menstrual cycle in a premenopausal woman requires further evalua-
tion, likely including biopsy if appropriate.

 ■ ABNORMAL MAMMOGRAM
Diagnostic mammography, which is performed after a palpable abnor-
mality has been detected, should not be confused with screening mam-
mography,  which  is  performed  in  an  asymptomatic  woman  with  no 
previously identified abnormalities.

Abnormalities  that  are  first  detected  by  physical  exam  and/or 
screening  mammography  should  be  evaluated  by  diagnostic  mam-
mography. Suspicious mammographic abnormalities include clustered, 
heterogeneous,  linear,  and  branching  microcalcifications;  densities 
(especially if spiculated); and new or enlarging architectural distortion. 
For  some  lesions,  ultrasound  may  be  helpful  either  to  identify  cysts 
or  to  guide  biopsy.  If  there  is  no  palpable  lesion  and  detailed  mam-
mographic studies are unequivocally benign, the patient should have 
routine  follow-up  appropriate  to  the  patient’s  age.  If  a  nonpalpable 
mammographic  lesion  has  a  low  index  of  suspicion,  mammographic 
follow-up in 3–6 months is reasonable. The presence of a breast lump 
and a negative mammogram does not rule out cancer, and if the phys-
ical  finding  persists  or  enlarges  during  follow-up,  further  evaluation 
and, if appropriate, a biopsy are indicated.

 ■ BREAST MASSES IN PREGNANCY OR LACTATION
Breast  cancer  develops  in  1  of  3000–4000  pregnancies.  The  breast 
grows during pregnancy under the influence of estrogen, progesterone, 

prolactin,  and  human  placental  lactogen.  After  delivery  and  during 
lactation,  breast  tissue  continues  to  be  under  the  influence  of  unop-
posed prolactin. Therefore, breast examination during these times can 
be challenging. Nonetheless, development of a dominant mass during 
pregnancy or lactation should not be attributed to hormonal changes 
without appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Stage for stage, breast cancer 
in pregnant patients is no different from premenopausal breast cancer 
in nonpregnant patients. However, pregnant women often have more 
advanced disease because the significance of a breast mass was not fully 
considered and/or because of endogenous hormone stimulation.

PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS OF THE BREAST
 ■ BENIGN BREAST HISTOPATHOLOGY
Only ~1 in every 5–10 breast biopsies leads to a diagnosis of cancer, 
although the rate of positive biopsies varies in different countries and 
clinical settings due to variable interpretation, medico-legal consider-
ations, and availability of mammograms. The vast majority of benign 
breast  masses  are  due  to  fibrocystic  changes,  a  descriptive  term  for 
small  fluid-filled  cysts  and  modest  epithelial  cell  and  fibrous  tissue 
hyperplasia. Women with ductal or lobular cell proliferation (~30% of 
patients), particularly the small fraction (3%) with atypical hyperplasia, 
have  a  fourfold  greater  risk  of  developing  breast  cancer  than  women 
who have not had a biopsy, and the risk is even higher if they have an 
affected first-degree relative. Follow-up breast imaging should be con-
tinued, but not on an accelerated or more intense fashion than regu-
larly indicated. Chemoprevention with antiestrogen therapy (SERM or 
aromatase inhibitor [AI]) should be considered for such patients. Pro-
phylactic mastectomy is not normally indicated. By contrast, patients 
with a benign biopsy without atypical hyperplasia are at little increased 
risk and may be followed routinely.

 ■ NONINVASIVE BREAST NEOPLASMS
Breast cancer develops as a series of molecular changes in the epithe-
lial cells that lead to ever more malignant behavior (Fig. 79-1). These 
changes  range  from  malignant  cells  confined  within  the  basement 
membrane  of  the  lobule  or  duct,  designated  “noninvasive”  or  more 
commonly  “in  situ”  carcinoma,  to  cancer  cells  that  have  invaded 
through the basement membrane into the surrounding normal tissue 
(“invasive”  or  “infiltrating”  cancer).  Increased  use  of  mammography 
has led to more frequent diagnoses of noninvasive breast neoplasms. 
These  lesions  fall  into  two  groups:  ductal  carcinoma  in  situ  (DCIS) 
(Fig. 79-2) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS; or lobular neoplasia in 
situ [LNIS]). The management of both entities is controversial.

Ductal  Carcinoma  In  Situ  Proliferation  of  cytologically  malig-
nant breast epithelial cells within the ducts is termed ductal carcinoma 
in  situ  (DCIS).  Atypical  hyperplasia  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish 
from DCIS. In many ways, DCIS is really a “premalignant” condition, 
but probably at least one-third of patients with untreated DCIS develop 
invasive breast cancer within 5 years. However, many low-grade DCIS 
lesions  do  not  appear  to  progress  over  many  years;  therefore,  many 
patients are overtreated. Unfortunately, no reliable methods distinguish 
patients who require treatment from those who may be safely observed.
Mastectomy  is  nearly  100%  effective  in  preventing  a  future  breast 
cancer event in that breast and fundamentally can be considered pro-
phylactic  surgery,  but  is  often  not  required  for  adequate  treatment. 
No  prospective  randomized  studies  have  directly  compared  breast- 
preserving therapy to mastectomy. However, the nearly 100% 10-year 
survival rates with the former suggest that it is a satisfactory strategy. 
Breast-preserving  therapy  refers  to  excisional  surgery  alone  with  or 
without  breast  radiation.  However,  although  survival  was  identical 
in  the  two  arms  of  a  randomized  trial  comparing  wide  excision  plus 
or  minus  irradiation,  the  latter  caused  a  substantial  reduction  in  the 
local recurrence rate as compared with wide excision alone. Addition 
of tamoxifen or an AI to any DCIS surgical/radiation therapy regimen 
further improves local control. However, in the largest trial comparing 
the two in DCIS, anastrozole did not improve distant disease-free or 
overall survival compared to tamoxifen.

PART 4Oncology and HematologySeveral  prognostic  features  may  help  to  identify  patients  at  high 
risk for local recurrence after either lumpectomy alone or lumpectomy 
with  radiation  therapy  and,  therefore,  might  provide  an  indication 
for  mastectomy.  These  include  extensive  disease  within  the  breast; 
age  <40;  and  cytologic  features  such  as  necrosis,  poor  nuclear  grade, 
and comedo subtype with overexpression of HER2. In summary, it is 
reasonable to recommend breast-preserving surgery for patients who 
have a localized focus of DCIS with clear margins followed by breast 
irradiation  and  tamoxifen  or  anastrozole.  Recently,  a  multifactorial 
gene expression assay has been shown to predict risk of recurrence in 
DCIS treated with breast-preserving surgery alone, but it is not clear 
that the in-breast risk recurrence rate in patients with low recurrence 
scores  is  sufficient  to  avoid  radiation.  The  decision  to  irradiate  such 
patients depends on the risk aversion to in-breast recurrence balanced 
against the risk associated with breast irradiation.

For patients with small, unicentric DCIS, axillary lymph node dis-
section  is  unnecessary.  However,  axillary  sentinel  lymph  node  (SLN) 
evaluation, which is discussed in greater detail below, may be indicated 
for widespread, larger, or poor grade DCIS or if microscopic invasion 
is  identified  on  a  core  biopsy.  In  such  cases,  subsequent  excision  or 
mastectomy may demonstrate invasive disease on the larger specimen. 
Since SLN mapping is indicated in such patients, doing so at the time 
of excision or mastectomy avoids a further surgical procedure at a later 
date.

Lobular  Carcinoma  (Neoplasia)  In  Situ  The  presence  of 
malignant  cells  within  the  lobules  is  termed  lobular  carcinoma  or 
neoplasia  in  situ  (LCIS).  LCIS  does  not  usually  cause  palpable  breast 
masses, nor does it often induce suspicious findings on mammogram. 
Therefore,  it  usually  is  found  as  an  incidental  finding  during  patho-
logic examination of a breast biopsy performed for some other reason. 
Unlike  DCIS,  which  is  usually  confined  to  a  single  area  in  a  breast, 
LCIS  is  often  spread  throughout  the  breast,  and  it  is  frequently  also 
found in the contralateral breast.

A diagnosis of LCIS itself does not confer a higher risk of mortality 
from breast cancer, but it does increase the risk of a subsequent breast 
cancer. Women with LCIS who do not undergo bilateral prophylactic 
mastectomy experience a new, invasive cancer in either breast at a rate 
of approximately 1% per year over at least the next 15–20 years, and 
probably lifelong. Therefore, LCIS is even more commonly considered 
a premalignant condition than DCIS, and aggressive local management 
seems unreasonable. Management options include careful observation 
with routine mammography and chemoprevention with either a SERM 
or  an  AI  (for  postmenopausal  women)  for  5  years.  Beyond  5  years, 
such  patients  should  be  followed  with  subsequent  annual  mammog-
raphy  and  semi-annual  physical  examinations.  Bilateral  prophylactic 
mastectomy is an alternative option, although it is no more effective in 
prolonging survival than the less aggressive approach, and it associated 
with substantial cosmetic, and perhaps emotional, morbidity.

 ■ INVASIVE BREAST CANCERS
Invasive breast cancers are of more concern than in situ lesions because 
they harbor the capacity to metastasize and cause substantial morbidity 
and mortality (Fig. 79-1). Eighty-five percent of invasive breast cancers 
are ductal in origin (Fig. 79-2), 10% are lobular or mixed ductal/lobular, 
and  the  other  5%  are  made  up  of  so-called  “special  types”  including 
mucinous  or  colloid  (2.4%),  tubular  (1.5%),  medullary  (1.2%),  and 
papillary (1%). Although not universally true, prognosis for the special 
types tends to be better than standard ductal or lobular cancers.

STAGING AND DIAGNOSTIC 
CONSIDERATIONS
Cancer staging has been traditionally based on the size of the tumor 
(T)  and  the  presence  or  absence  of  regional  nodal  (N)  and  distant 
metastases (M). More recently, tumor grade and biological characteris-
tics, such as expression of ER and HER2, have been incorporated into 
staging, making the system quite complex. Staging can be performed 
clinically or pathologically, before or after adjuvant systemic therapy. 
These are designated as a prefix before the stage as cTNM or pTNM 

617

if  determined  before  or  yTNM  if  determined  after  systemic  (neoad-
juvant) therapy. Although staging is an important part of the surgical 
evaluation and pathology reporting system, the specific elements that 
inform  the  clinician  of  both  prognosis  and  likelihood  of  response  to 
specific  therapies  have  become  more  critical  determinants  of  patient 
care than a simple stage designation. Importantly, imaging for detec-
tion of distant metastases is not needed in a patient with no signs or 
symptoms of widespread disease and who has a T3 or smaller tumor 
and fewer than four involved axillary lymph nodes, since the odds of 
finding distant metastases in such patients are low and the risk of false 
positives  outweighs  true-positive  findings.  Although  finding  bone 
marrow micrometastases or circulating tumor cells (cM0(i+)) has been 
associated  with  worse  prognosis,  how  to  integrate  these  into  routine 
clinical care has not been determined, and their assessment is not rec-
ommended in patients with early-stage disease.

TREATMENT
Early-Stage Breast Cancer 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Goals of Therapy  The goal of therapy for breast cancer in patients 
who do not have obvious evidence of distant metastases (meaning 
outside  the  breast,  chest  wall,  and  regional  lymph  nodes)  is  cure, 
or  at  least  substantial  survival  prolongation.  For  these  patients, 
treatment strategies are divided into primary and systemic consid-
erations. Primary therapies consist of surgical and radiation treat-
ments  directed  toward  the  breast  and  locoregional  lymph  nodes. 
These  approaches  are  designed  to  minimize  the  odds  of  locore-
gional recurrence while maintaining quality of life and cosmesis as 
much as possible by excising the cancer and sterilizing unaffected 
breast tissue as appropriate. Adjuvant systemic treatments, consist-
ing of endocrine, anti-HER2, and/or chemotherapies, are given to 
treat micrometastases that may have already escaped to distant sites 
but are not yet detectable. 
Prognostic  and  Predictive  Factors  All  treatments  for  breast 
cancer are based on prognostic and predictive factors. Prognostic 
factors provide an indication of how likely a cancer will recur either 
locally or in distant organs in the future if a patient is not treated 
with the respective treatments. Predictive factors are used to deter-
mine  if  a  given  treatment  is  likely  to  work  or  not,  assuming  the 
patient’s prognosis justifies treatment (or further treatment assum-
ing the patient has been treated in some manner already).

Anatomic prognostic features include visual and physical exami-
nation findings of locally advanced breast cancer (T4 lesions: skin 
erythema  [“inflammatory”]  or  edema  [“peau  d’orange”],  nodules, 
or ulceration or tumor fixation to the chest wall). In patients with-
out any of these findings, the most important prognostic features 
remain tumor size (T) and lymph node (N) status.

Biologic features, such as histologic tumor grade as well as ER, 
PgR, and HER2 status, are also prognostic. Indeed, gene expression 
patterns,  or  “signatures,”  have  demonstrated  that  breast  cancer  is 
actually many different diseases and can be divided into a series of 
intrinsic subtypes. These subtypes are driven principally, although 
not exclusively, by expression of ER and HER2 and their respective 
associated  pathways,  as  well  as  measures  of  cellular  proliferation 
and  other  less  important  but  still  contributory  biologic  features. 
These intrinsic subtypes are important clinically, both in influenc-
ing natural history as well as in prognosis and therapeutic decision 
making. Four different intrinsic subtypes are recognized: luminal, 
HER2-like, basal, and claudin-low. Some, if not all, have been fur-
ther divided into subgroups.

Luminal  breast  cancers  are  almost  always  positive  for  ER  and 
negative  for  HER2  amplification.  Luminal  A  tumors  have  the 
highest levels of ER and downstream related genes, are almost uni-
versally negative or low in HER2, are usually low grade, have low 
proliferative thrust, and have a generally favorable prognosis. They 
are  most  likely  to  respond  to  endocrine  therapy  and  may  appear

to  be  less  responsive  to  chemotherapy.  Luminal  B  breast  cancers 
tend to be PgR negative, may express HER2 but at low levels, are 
usually  higher  grade,  and  have  higher  proliferative  activity  than 
luminal A tumors. Prognosis is somewhat worse than for luminal 
A cancers, and although not yet proven, they may be more sensitive 
to chemotherapy.

HER2-amplified  breast  cancers  exhibit  co-amplification  and 
overexpression  of  other  genes  adjacent  to  HER2.  Historically,  the 
clinical  prognosis  of  such  tumors  was  poor,  but  it  has  markedly 
improved with the introduction of targeted anti-HER2 therapies.

Basal breast cancers are mostly negative for expression of ER/PgR 
and  HER2.  Tumors  of  this  type  are  often  called  “triple-negative” 
malignancies, although this is a general term, and such cancers have 
been  further  subgrouped  based  on  other  genetic  abnormalities. 
They tend to be high grade and express cytokeratins 5/6 and 17 as 
well as vimentin, p63, CD10, α-smooth muscle actin, and epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Patients with germline BRCA1 
mutations also usually fall within this molecular subtype.

Normal  breast-like  and  claudin-low  cancers  have  also  been  dis-
tinguished,  but  at  present,  these  designations  have  failed  to  have 
clinical significance.

Over the past decade, several multiparameter tests based on gene 
expression have been developed to determine prognosis in patients 
who have node-negative, ER-positive, and HER2-negative disease. 
These assays have been principally used to guide decisions regard-
ing  use  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy,  as  discussed  below.  Predictive 
features  are  usually  used  to  guide  targeted  systemic  therapies. 
These  include  ER  for  endocrine  treatments  and  HER2  for  anti-
HER2 therapies, such as trastuzumab, and more recently BRCA1/2 
and PIK3CA mutations for poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) 
inhibitors and PIK3CA inhibitors, respectively. 

LOCAL (PRIMARY) TREATMENTS
In the 1980s, the Halsted radical mastectomy was replaced with the 
less  disfiguring  modified  radical  mastectomy,  in  which  chest  wall 
muscles are preserved and only a sampling of axillary lymph nodes 
are removed. Subsequently, breast-conserving treatments, consisting 
of  surgical  excision  of  the  primary  tumor  (lumpectomy,  quadran-
tectomy,  or  partial  mastectomy)  often  followed  by  locoregional 
radiation, were introduced and shown to have equal if not slightly 
superior outcomes to those associated with mastectomy. For women 
undergoing breast conservation, postlumpectomy radiation is usu-
ally  indicated,  although  it  may  be  less  necessary  in  older  women 
with  ER-positive,  node-negative  breast  cancer,  since  their  risk  of 
subsequent in-breast recurrence is quite low with surgery and endo-
crine therapy only. When lumpectomy with negative tumor margins 
is achieved and radiation is delivered appropriately, breast conserva-
tion is associated with a recurrence rate in the breast of ≤5%.

Not  all  patients  are  candidates  for  breast-conserving  therapy. 
Contraindications  include  large  tumor  to  breast  ratio,  inability 
to  achieve  clear  margins  with  adequate  cosmesis  after  extensive 
surgery,  multifocal  cancers,  extensive  four-quadrant  DCIS,  and 
inability to receive radiation. The latter issue arises in women with 
dermal  autoimmune  disease  (such  as  lupus  erythematosus),  prior 
radiation  to  the  site,  and/or  lack  of  available  radiation  treatment 
facilities. Further, although not contraindicated, breast-conserving 
therapy may be less cosmetically acceptable than mastectomy with 
reconstruction if the nipple-areolar complex is involved with cancer 
and must be sacrificed. This is a personal choice, and some women 
prefer mastectomy, especially those with high genetic risks for sec-
ond breast cancers.

Enigmatically, in spite of the supporting data, only approximately 
one-third of women in the United States are managed by lumpec-
tomy. It appears that many women still undergo mastectomy who 
could safely avoid this procedure and probably would if appropri-
ately counseled. Most patients should consult with an experienced 
breast  surgeon  and  radiation  oncologist  before  making  a  final 
decision  concerning  local  therapy.  Indeed,  a  multimodality  clinic 
in which the surgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, and 

other  caregivers  cooperate  to  evaluate  the  patient  and  develop  a 
treatment plan is usually considered a major advantage by patients.
For  patients  who  do  undergo  mastectomy,  nipple-areolar- 
sparing  mastectomy  preserves  the  dermis  and  epidermis  of  the 
nipple but removes the major ducts from within the nipple lumen 
and  often  provides  more  acceptable  cosmesis  when  combined 
with reconstruction. This approach is often a preferable option for 
patients who are having prophylactic surgery or those with cancer 
who  are  candidates  for  immediate  reconstruction.  Nipple-sparing 
mastectomy  is  contraindicated  in  the  presence  of  inflammatory 
breast  cancer,  clinical  involvement  of  the  nipple-areolar  complex, 
nipple  retraction,  Paget  disease,  bloody  nipple  discharge,  or  mul-
ticentricity.  The  safety  of  nipple-sparing  mastectomy  is  based  on 
retrospective, nonrandomized cohort series. In a meta-analysis of 
20  studies  (5594  patients),  overall  and  disease-free  survival  and 
locoregional recurrence rates appeared similar to those of patients 
undergoing modified radical mastectomy.

After mastectomy, breast reconstruction is an acceptable option. 
Breast  reconstruction  can  be  achieved  by  either  placement  of  an 
exogenous  implant  (usually  silicon)  or  by  transferring  autologous 
tissue from another site, such as the abdomen, latissimus dorsi, or 
gluteal areas, to the breast. Of note, patients should be aware that 
a reconstructed breast is usually insensate. Risks of reconstruction 
include surgical complications such as infection and hemorrhage. 
Reconstruction  does  not  hinder  detection  of  future  recurrences, 
nor is silicone implant reconstruction associated with non-cancer- 
related  syndromes,  although  on  occasion,  these  can  rupture  and 
removal  is  required.  Breast  implant–associated  anaplastic  large 
cell lymphoma is an extraordinarily rare complication of textured 
silicone implants. Although occasionally associated with metastatic 
lymphoma,  it  is  usually  confined  locally  and  highly  curable.  The 
optimal choice of implant reconstruction should be made with an 
experienced breast plastic surgeon.

Postmastectomy chest wall and regional nodal radiation reduces 
locoregional  recurrence  and  improves  survival.  It  is  indicated  for 
patients  with  high  risk  of  locoregional  recurrence,  such  as  those 
with  tumors  ≥5  cm,  four  or  more  positive  axillary  lymph  nodes, 
or postoperative positive margins. Postmastectomy radiation is not 
indicated  in  women  with  cancers  <2  cm,  negative  lymph  nodes, 
and  negative  margins.  It  is  considered  for  women  who  fall  into 
the  areas  between  these  (2–5  cm,  one  to  three  positive  nodes,  or 
close  margins)  and  is  usually  recommended  if  a  patient  has  one 
to  three  involved  axillary  lymph  nodes.  Many  radiation  oncolo-
gists and plastic surgeons prefer postmastectomy radiation before 
reconstruction.

The survival of patients who have recurrence in the breast after 
proper  treatment  (adequate  surgery  and  radiation  if  indicated)  is 
somewhat  worse  than  that  of  women  who  do  not  have  in-breast 
recurrences,  but  it  is  better  than  those  who  suffer  locoregional 
recurrence  after  mastectomy.  Thus,  locoregional  recurrence  is  a 
negative  prognostic  variable  for  long-term  survival  but  not  the 
cause of distant metastasis. 
Evaluation  and  Treatment  of  the  Axillary  Lymph  Nodes  SLN 
mapping  and  biopsy  (SLNB)  is  generally  the  standard  of  care  for 
women  with  localized  breast  cancer  and  clinically  negative  axilla. 
This  procedure  involves  injecting  a  dye  or  radioactive  tracer  into 
the involved breast and, a few hours (4–24) later, undergoing resec-
tion of the axillary node containing the dye or tracer. If that lymph 
node is negative for tumor, more extensive axillary surgery is not 
required, avoiding much of the risk of postdissection lymphedema. 
Even in the presence of sentinel lymph node involvement, further 
axillary surgery may not be required for selected patients, such as 
older women and those with ER-positive cancers. 
ADJUVANT SYSTEMIC THERAPIES
The use of adjuvant systemic therapy is based on the concept that 
with  increasing  generations  of  cellular  replication,  genetic  abnor-
malities  accumulate.  These  mutations  occur  randomly  and  may 
lead to sensitivity or resistance to therapies, but of course, the latter

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyis  of  greater  concern.  Almost  all  patients  with  metastatic  breast 
cancer  are  destined  to  die  with,  if  not  of,  their  cancer.  However, 
treatment with the same therapies administered earlier, in the set-
ting of micrometastatic disease only, is more effective than waiting 
until  symptomatic,  documented  metastases  occur  and  substan-
tially improves survival. More than half of the women who would 
otherwise  die  of  metastatic  breast  cancer  remain  disease-free  and 
experience considerable survival advantage when treated with the 
appropriate adjuvant systemic regimen. 

Prognostic and Predictive Variables  Adjuvant systemic therapies 
are  of  three  types:  (1)  chemotherapy;  (2)  endocrine  therapy;  and 
(3)  anti-HER2  therapies.  The  decision  of  whether  to  apply  adju-
vant systemic therapy, and which type, depends on prognostic and 
predictive features as well as the combined judgment of the patient 
and caregiver.

Prognostic  Factors  As  noted,  prognostic  factors  help  define 
who  most  likely  needs,  or  perhaps  more  importantly  does  not 
need,  adjuvant  systemic  therapy.  In  contrast,  predictive  factors 
help  identify  which  therapies  are  likely  to  work,  independent  of 
prognosis  (Table  79-1).  The  most  important  prognostic  variables 
are  provided  by  tumor  staging:  tumor  size  (T),  lymph  node  status 
(N), and detectable distant metastases (M) (Table 79-2). Histologic 
grading is also important. Tumors with a poor nuclear grade (grade 
3) have a higher risk of recurrence than tumors with a good nuclear 
grade (grade 1). Infiltrating lobular cancer, which is almost always 
ER  positive,  has  roughly  the  same  prognosis  as  ER-positive  infil-
trating ductal cancer, although the lobular subtype may be slightly 
worse. Lobular cancers are harder to detect on mammography and 
within axillary lymph nodes than ductal cancers, and when they do 
metastasize, they often spread to unusual sites, such as mesothelial 
surfaces, the ovaries, and gastrointestinal organs. Among the special 
types of breast cancer, pure tubular and mucinous cancers are asso-
ciated with very favorable prognoses. Medullary cancers are often 
triple negative with poor nuclear grade, but paradoxically, they have 
a  heavy  infiltrating  lymphocyte  component,  and  they  also  have  a 
favorable prognosis. However, before treatment is directed toward 
these types of cancers, their histology should be confirmed by an 
experienced breast pathologist.

Adjuvant systemic therapy may not be needed at all for patients 
with very small (<1 cm) tumors and negative lymph nodes. How-
ever,  every  patient  with  invasive  breast  cancer  has  some  risk  of 
subsequent  distant  metastases.  Most  patients  are  more  likely  to 
accept  endocrine  therapy  for  a  very  small  potential  benefit  than 
they  would  accept  chemotherapy  for  the  same  calculated  advan-
tage  because  the  former  is  much  less  often  associated  with  either 
life-threatening or permanently life-changing toxicities.

The greatest controversy concerns the recommendation for adju-
vant chemotherapy. Since no established factor predicts sensitivity 
or  resistance  for  this  class  of  treatments,  the  decision  must  be 
made on prognosis alone. Overall, chemotherapy reduces the risk 
of  recurrence  over  the  10  years  subsequent  to  primary  diagnosis 
by approximately one-third. For patients with T4 cancers or many 
positive lymph nodes, the risk of distant recurrence (and thus not

being cured) in the subsequent decade is 50% or higher. Therefore, 
a  one-third  reduction  of  a  50%  risk  of  recurrence  means  that  at 
least 15–20% (one-third × 50%) of women will be cured who would 
not have been cured in the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy. The 
life-threatening or permanently life-changing toxicities of adjuvant 
chemotherapy are ~1–2%, and therefore, almost all medical oncol-
ogists would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting.

In  contrast,  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  rarely  justified  in  most 
women with tumors <1 cm in size whose axillary lymph nodes are 
negative.  However,  this  decision  is  very  much  influenced  by  the 
expression  of  ER  and  HER2.  For  example,  the  risk  of  recurrence 
of a patient with a small, node-negative but triple-negative breast 
cancer over the succeeding 10 years without any adjuvant therapy 
is  15%.  If  chemotherapy  reduces  this  risk  by  approximately  one-
third or more, then approximately 5% or more of patients will be 
cured who would otherwise have died of their disease. Likewise, a 
patient with ER- and PgR-negative but HER2-positive disease has a 
slightly worse prognosis, with a risk of recurrence over 10 years of 
approximately 20%. She will benefit not only from the adjuvant che-
motherapy but also from anti-HER2 therapy, so that her potential 
absolute benefit is even higher. Many, but not all, clinicians would 
recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for such patients.

On  the  other  hand,  patients  with  ER-positive  disease  have  a 
better  prognosis  than  those  with  ER-negative  breast  cancer,  and 
adjuvant endocrine therapy will further reduce the odds of recur-
rence by approximately one-half. Therefore, the same patient in the 
example above (<1 cm, node negative) but who has an ER-positive 
and  HER2-negative  cancer  has  a  lower  initial  risk  of  recurrence 
(~10%  over  10  years).  She  is  very  likely  to  accept  adjuvant  endo-
crine therapy, further lowering her estimated risk of recurrence to 
~5%. Even if chemotherapy reduces this residual risk by approxi-
mately one-third, no more than 1–2% (one-third × 5%) of patients 
will benefit. This potential benefit is approximately the same as the 
number of patients who will suffer life-threatening or permanently 
life-changing toxicities from chemotherapy. Thus, in this case, most 
clinicians  would  recommend  adjuvant  endocrine  therapy  but  not 
chemotherapy.

Multiparameter  gene  expression  assays  have  refined  prognos-
tic  determination,  particularly  in  node-negative,  ER-positive,  and 
HER2-negative  breast  cancers.  These  tests  include  the  21-gene 
Oncotype DX, the 12-gene Endopredict, the 58-gene ProSigna, and 
the 2-gene Breast Cancer Index. Furthermore, several investigators 
have reported that analysis of ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 by immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC4) also provides prognostic information in 
this group, but the analytical validity of this assay is quite variable 
among  different  pathologists.  Assuming  adequate  adjuvant  endo-
crine therapy, the prognosis of such patients whose tumors have low 
recurrence scores, which usually identifies luminal A type cancers, 
with one of these assays is so good they can safely forego adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Indeed, the same is true for such patients with inter-
mediate  Oncotype  DX  recurrence  scores.  In  contrast,  those  with 
high recurrence scores (>25) appear to have luminal B cancers, and 
the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy clearly outweigh the risks.

The largest data set for directing care has been generated using 
the  21-gene  recurrence  score.  However,  only  one  of  these  tests 
should  be  ordered  for  a  single  patient,  since  they  do  not  always 
give the same results, and there are no data to determine which, in 
the case of discordance, might be “correct.” Use of these assays to 
determine prognosis in patients with higher anatomic stage, such as 
T3b/T4 lesions, or multiple positive lymph nodes, especially if more 
than three, is still under investigation.

Several  measures  of  tumor  growth  rate  correlate  with  early 
relapse,  but  their  use  is  problematic  due  to  analytical  variability. 
Of  these,  assessment  using  immunohistochemical  (IHC)  assays 
for  the  proliferation  marker  Ki67  is  the  most  widespread.  How-
ever,  substantial  lab-to-lab  variability  and  disagreement  regarding 
optimal  cut  points  exist.  At  present,  in  standard  practice  outside 
of a highly skilled laboratory, Ki67 expression is not used to make 
clinical decisions.

Predictive Factors  The two most important predictive factors 
in breast cancer are ER and HER2 expression, and they should be 
performed  on  all  primary  or  metastatic  cancer  biopsy  specimens 
(Table 79-1). Adjuvant endocrine therapy reduces the risk of recur-
rence by one-half or more in patients with ER-rich cancers, whereas 
no detectable benefit is noted in patients with ER-poor or -negative 
cancers. ER is expressed as the percentage of positive cells within 
the cancer after IHC staining. Endocrine therapy is recommended 
for  any  patient  with  ≥10%  positive  cells,  but  not  for  those  whose 
cancers only have 0–1% staining. The evidence supporting benefit 
in cases with 1–9% expression is weak, but given the potential ben-
efit and relatively low toxicities of endocrine therapy, it is recom-
mended for such patients with a low threshold for discontinuation 
if side effects are intolerable.

The HER2 protein is the target for anti-HER2-directed therapies. 
Adjuvant  trastuzumab  therapy  reduces  the  risk  of  distant  recur-
rence  and  death  in  patients  with  HER2-positive  breast  cancer  by 
one-third or more but has no discernable effect on HER2-negative 
cancers. HER2 status is determined using either IHC staining for 
protein overexpression or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
for gene amplification. IHC staining of 3+ (on a scale of 0–3+) is 
considered positive, whereas 0–1+ is considered negative. For cases 
with 2+ staining, reflex FISH analysis is recommended. FISH can 
either be used as the initial evaluation or for additional evaluation 
in IHC 2+ cases. HER2 is considered amplified if the ratio of HER2 
to  centromere  signal  on  chromosome  17  is  ≥2.0.  FISH  is  unnec-
essary if IHC is 3+ or 0–1+, nor is there reason for IHC testing if 
FISH is ≥2.0

No reliable predictive factors exist for chemotherapy in general 
or for specific types of chemotherapies. It has been hypothesized 
that  chemotherapy  may  be  more  active  in  ER-negative  and/or 
HER2-positive cancers. Luminal B cancers may be more chemo-
therapy sensitive, whereas luminal A cancers are perceived to be 
relatively  chemotherapy  resistant.  At  present,  none  of  the  tests 
for  intrinsic  subtype  should  be  used  to  determine  not  to  give 
chemotherapy  to  patients  with  poor  anatomic  prognosis,  such  as 
those with T4 or multiple positive nodes, based on prediction of 
resistance. Attempts to identify reliable predictive factors for indi-
vidual classes of chemotherapeutic agents (such as anthracyclines, 
alkylating agents, or taxanes) have been unsuccessful. The platin 
salts (carboplatin, cisplatin) may have higher activity in patients 
with  triple-negative  breast  cancer  and  perhaps  in  patients  with 
HER2-positive disease. The PARP inhibitors may be more active 
in  patients  whose  tumors  have  defects  in  homologous  recom-
bination  DNA  repair,  a  group  that  includes  those  with  BRCA 
mutations. 

Adjuvant  Regimens  •  Endocrine  Therapy  Adjuvant  endo-
crine  therapy  is  indicated  for  nearly  all  patients  with  a  diagnosis 
of ER-positive breast cancer and never for those with ER-negative 
disease. Two adjuvant endocrine therapy strategies are proven: the 
SERM tamoxifen or estrogen ablation. In addition to being effective 
in  preventing  new  cancers  and  reducing  the  risk  of  locoregional 
recurrences  in  patients  with  DCIS,  tamoxifen  reduces  the  risk 
of  distant  recurrence  and  death  due  to  invasive  breast  cancer  by 
~40% over the decade following diagnosis. It is equally effective in 
pre- and postmenopausal women, although it may be slightly less 
effective  in  very  young  (<40  years)  patients.  Because  tamoxifen 
is a SERM, it has mixed ER antagonism (in the breast and brain) 
and agonism (in the bone, liver, and uterus). Therefore, it is active 
against  breast  cancer  in  the  prevention,  adjuvant,  and  metastatic 
settings.

Side  effects  of  tamoxifen  are  predictable  based  on  ER  antago-
nism, including frequent hot flashes as well as vaginal discomfort/
sexual  dysfunction  and  myalgias  and  arthralgias.  The  agonistic 
effect  results  in  reduction  of  osteopenia/osteoporosis,  especially 
in  postmenopausal  women,  but  it  increases  thrombosis  risk  and 
endometrial  cancers  due  to  this  effect  in  the  liver  and  uterus, 
respectively.

Estrogen  depletion  can  be  achieved  surgically  in  premenopausal 
women by oophorectomy or ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin- 
releasing  hormone  (GnRH)  superagonist,  such  as  goserelin  or 
leuprolide,  which  invoke  a  tachyphylactic  response,  or  a  GnRH 
antagonist,  such  as  triptorelin.  However,  women  with  nonfunc-
tioning  ovaries,  whether  induced  or  by  natural  menopause,  still 
produce small amounts of estrogen by adrenal synthesis of estrogen 
precursors (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]). These 
are  converted  to  estradiol  and  estrone  by  aromatase  activity  in 
peripheral fat and possibly cancer cells. In postmenopausal women, 
circulating estrogen can be reduced to nearly imperceptible levels 
with the use of oral AIs: anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. The 
three AIs are not significantly different in activity or toxicity. All are 
slightly more effective than tamoxifen.

Toxicities of the AIs are predictable based on very low estrogen 
levels.  These  include  hot  flashes,  musculoskeletal  symptoms,  and 
atrophic vaginitis/sexual dysfunction. They also induce or worsen 
osteoporosis  and  fractures,  although  this  effect  can  be  abrogated 
with bone-modifying agents, such as bisphosphonates or rank lig-
and antagonists (denosumab).

For  both  tamoxifen  and  the  AIs,  musculoskeletal  symptoms 
mimicking osteoarthritis and arthralgias can be treated with physi-
cal therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. After a brief 
period of washout after discontinuation, switching from one AI to 
another relieves this symptom in approximately a third of patients. 
These symptoms can also be reduced with either acupuncture or the 
antidepressant duloxetine. If AIs cannot be tolerated, tamoxifen is 
a reasonable therapy, assuming no contraindications, such as a past 
history of thrombosis or high risk of cerebrovascular disease. Hot 
flashes  from  either  class  of  drugs  are  alleviated  in  approximately 
one-half of patients with use of one of several different antidepres-
sant drugs.

For premenopausal women, optimal endocrine therapy depends 
on  prognosis  and  patient  choice.  Complete  estrogen  depletion  is 
slightly  more  effective  than  tamoxifen  alone,  but  it  may  also  be 
associated with more bothersome side effects, such as hot flashes, 
vaginal dryness, and sexual dysfunction. Complete estrogen deple-
tion,  consisting  of  either  oophorectomy  or  chemical  suppression 
of gonadotropins coupled with an AI, is indicated for women with 
worse prognosis, in particular node positivity. For those with more 
favorable  prognosis,  tamoxifen  alone  or  with  ovarian  suppression 
is adequate and produces better quality of life. The AIs should not 
be administered to women with functioning, or dormant, ovaries, 
since the negative hypothalamic-pituitary feedback can result in a 
rebound overproduction of ovarian estrogens.

The  duration  of  adjuvant  endocrine  treatment  is  unclear.  For-
merly, the standard recommendation was at least 5 years of therapy, 
which clearly reduces the risk of recurrence during that time and for 
a few years after discontinuation. However, the annual risk of distant 
recurrence during the subsequent 15 years is 0.5–3%, depending on 
the  initial  T  and  N  status.  Extended  adjuvant  endocrine  therapy 
with either tamoxifen or an AI for at least 5 more years continues to 
reduce this late risk of relapse. The decision of whether to continue 
adjuvant endocrine therapy or not after 5 years must therefore take 
into consideration initial risk (T, N, grade), current side effects and 
potential cumulative toxicities, and the patient’s perception of the 
relative and absolute benefits and risks.

Chemotherapy  Multiple-agent  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  more 
effective  than  single-agent  chemotherapy.  Although  chemother-
apeutic  agents  are  usually  delivered  in  combination,  sequential 
single-agent chemotherapy is as effective, and may be slightly less 
toxic, although it requires longer total duration to deliver. Adminis-
tration of four to six cycles of chemotherapy appears to be optimal; 
one  cycle  is  less  effective  than  six,  but  more  than  six  cycles  have 
generally  increased  toxicity  without  further  efficacy.  Importantly, 
although  chemotherapy  is  combined  with  anti-HER2  therapy  in 
patients  with  HER2-positive  cancers,  concurrent  endocrine  ther-
apy,  in  particular  tamoxifen,  is  antagonistic  with  chemotherapy.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyTherefore,  they  are  administered  sequentially,  starting  the  endo-
crine therapy after completion of chemotherapy.

Several  chemotherapeutic  agents  have  activity  in  the  adjuvant 
setting.  These  include  alkylating  agents  (principally  cyclophos-
phamide),  anthracyclines  (doxorubicin,  epirubicin),  antimetabo-
lites (5-fluoruracil [5-FU], capecitabine, methotrexate), the taxanes 
(paclitaxel, docetaxel), and the platinum salts (cisplatin, carboplatin). 
Within classes, randomized trials have failed to demonstrate supe-
riority of one agent versus another (e.g., doxorubicin vs epirubicin, 
or  paclitaxel  vs  docetaxel).  Escalation  above  an  optimal  dose  is 
not more effective. The antineoplastic advantage of more frequent 
scheduling  for  most  individual  agents  has  been  demonstrated  in 
a  well-done  meta-analysis.  Weekly  or  every-other-week  paclitaxel 
is  superior  to  every-3-week  infusion,  whereas,  enigmatically,  the 
opposite is true for docetaxel. Taken together, the data support giv-
ing adjuvant chemotherapy in a dose-dense fashion.

The  oldest  combination  regimen  consists  of  cyclophosphamide, 
methotrexate, and 5-FU (CMF). Addition of an anthracycline or sub-
stitution  of  an  anthracycline  for  the  antimetabolites  improves  out-
comes slightly, albeit with slightly increased risk of heart failure and 
secondary leukemia. Addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based 
regimen further modestly reduces the chances of distant recurrence 
and death. Likewise, addition of an anthracycline to a taxane-based 
regimen is also modestly more effective than a taxane plus cyclo-
phosphamide alone.

Which regimen is appropriate for a patient must be individual-
ized based on prognosis, comorbid conditions, and the perspective 
of  the  patient.  For  example,  the  modest  relative  improvement  of 
giving  an  anthracycline,  cyclophosphamide,  and  a  taxane  (AC-T) 
may  not  translate  to  a  sufficiently  large  absolute  improvement  in 
survival in a patient with a relatively small (T2) tumor and negative 
nodes, whereas that same relative reduction in death may translate 
to  a  sufficiently  large  absolute  benefit  in  a  patient  with  a  worse 
prognosis. Therefore, the former patient might best be served with 
a  taxane/cyclophosphamide  (TC)  regimen  alone,  while  the  latter 
might wish to accept the added risk of congestive heart failure and 
leukemia associated with the anthracyclines. 

Neoadjuvant  Chemotherapy  Preoperative,  or  “neoadjuvant,” 
treatment  involves  the  administration  of  adjuvant  systemic  ther-
apy, most commonly chemotherapy, before definitive surgery and 
radiation therapy. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with 
ER-positive disease is usually given preoperatively for 4–6 months. 
However, it is generally reserved for patients for whom a reason for 
surgical delay exists, such as comorbid conditions.

The  objective  partial  and  complete  response  rates  of  patients 
with  breast  cancer  to  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  range  from  10 
to  75%  depending  on  the  intrinsic  subtype  of  the  cancer  and 
the  regimen  used.  Thus,  many  patients  will  be  “downstaged”  by 
neoadjuvant  chemotherapy.  In  this  circumstance,  patients  with 
locally  advanced,  inoperable  cancers  may  become  candidates  for 
surgery,  and  approximately  15%  of  patients  who  are  not  consid-
ered eligible for breast-conserving surgery may become so due to 
shrinkage  of  their  cancer.  However,  overall  survival  has  not  been 
improved  using  this  approach  as  compared  with  the  same  drugs 
given postoperatively.

Patients  who  achieve  a  pathologic  complete  remission  (pCR) 
after  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  have  a  substantially  improved 
survival  compared  to  those  who  do  not.  It  is  unknown  if  this 
observation implies that the latter group did not benefit or just had 
a worse initial prognosis, yet still gained some benefit. Delivering 
more therapy to patients who do not have a pCR is appealing. How-
ever, it is possible that these patients have chemotherapy-resistant 
disease,  and  therefore,  more  chemotherapy  may  not  be  of  value. 
Clearly  nonchemotherapeutic  strategies,  such  as  adjuvant  endo-
crine therapy if they have an ER-positive breast cancer and adjuvant 
anti-HER2 therapy if their cancer is HER2 positive, are warranted.
Adding  or  changing  systemic  therapies  may  benefit  selected 
groups of patients who do not have a pCR. Approximately 6 months 

621

of a postsurgical oral fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine, reduces dis-
tant metastases in patients with triple-negative breast cancer who 
have  residual  disease  after  non-fluoropyrimidine-containing  neo-
adjuvant  chemotherapy.  Similarly,  postoperative  therapy  with  an 
antibody-drug conjugate consisting of trastuzumab and the antitu-
bulin emtansine (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) is superior to con-
tinuing unconjugated trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive 
breast cancer who did not achieve pCR with preoperative chemo-
therapy and trastuzumab.

Chemotherapy  Toxicities  Chemotherapy  is  associated  with  nau-
sea,  vomiting,  and  alopecia  in  nearly  100%  of  patients.  Nausea 
and vomiting are usually well controlled with modern antiemetics. 
Small  but  convincing  studies  have  suggested  that  the  strategy  of 
constricting blood flow to the scalp with various means of cooling 
is  commonly  effective  in  sparing  hair  loss,  without  evidence  of 
increased scalp metastases.

More importantly, chemotherapy causes potential life-threatening 
or  life-changing  toxicities  in  2–3%  of  all  treated  patients.  These 
include  neutropenia  and  fever,  with  a  risk  of  infection  of  ~1%, 
which  can  be  prevented  with  appropriate  use  of  the  growth  fac-
tor  filgrastim.  Secondary  myelodysplasia  and  leukemia  occur  in 
~0.5–1%  of  patients  treated  with  anthracyclines  as  well  as  with 
high  cumulative  doses  of  cyclophosphamide,  usually  occurring 
within  2–5  years  of  treatment.  The  anthracyclines  cause  cumu-
lative  dose-related  congestive  heart  failure,  which  occurs  in  ~1% 
of  patients  treated  with  standard  four  to  five  cycles  at  60  mg/m2. 
Peripheral neuropathy is the major dose-limiting and life-changing 
toxicity  of  the  taxanes.  Neuropathy  occurs  during  treatment  in   
~15–20%  of  patients,  and  permanent,  chronic  neuropathy  persists 
in 3–5%. Many patients complain of cognitive dysfunction, so-called 
“chemo-brain.” Although occasional cases of apparent organic che-
motherapeutic toxic effects on cognitive function are noted, much of 
this syndrome may be due to anxiety, depression, and fatigue caused 
by the diagnosis itself or the treatment for it. Although not always, 
cognitive functioning usually returns to age-adjusted baseline sev-
eral months after discontinuation of therapy. 

Anti-HER2 Therapy  The humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal anti-
body trastuzumab decreases both risk of recurrence and mortality 
in  early-stage  breast  cancer.  Trastuzumab  is  optimally  delivered 
concurrently  with  chemotherapy,  particularly  in  association  with 
a taxane. Concurrent treatment with an anthracycline is generally 
avoided, since the main toxicity of trastuzumab is cardiac dysfunc-
tion, which appears more often when the agent is delivered simul-
taneously  with  doxorubicin.  In  patients  with  reasonably  favorable 
prognosis  (T1  or  T2,  node  negative),  single-agent  paclitaxel  plus 
trastuzumab  is  an  adequate  regimen.  The  addition  of  a  second 
anti-HER2  monoclonal  antibody,  pertuzumab,  in  combination 
with trastuzumab is modestly superior to trastuzumab alone. When 
given in the neoadjuvant setting, this combination results in higher 
pCR rates than single-agent trastuzumab. At least in patients with 
poor prognostic features, such as positive axillary lymph nodes, the 
combination  significantly  reduces  distant  metastases  and  perhaps 
mortality.  As  noted,  neoadjuvant  studies  have  demonstrated  that 
postoperative  ado-trastuzumab  emtansine  is  superior  to  trastu-
zumab in patients who do not achieve a pCR.

Trastuzumab  is  administered  intravenously  weekly  or  every   
3 weeks. Twelve months of trastuzumab therapy are optimal with 
no additional benefit beyond 12 months. Treatment for 6 months 
is  more  effective  than  no  trastuzumab  therapy  but  is  inferior  to   
12 months. A preparation of trastuzumab for subcutaneous injec-
tion has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Selected  anti-HER2  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  have  activity 
against HER2-positive breast cancer, but their benefit in the adju-
vant setting is limited. Lapatinib does not add to trastuzumab ther-
apy, and single-agent adjuvant lapatinib is inferior to single-agent 
trastuzumab.  Another  anti-HER2  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  nera-
tinib, is modestly superior to no anti-HER2 therapy. Neratinib has

622

not  been  compared  to  trastuzumab  either  as  a  single  agent  or  in 
combination.
Toxicities of Anti-HER2 Adjuvant Therapies 
In general, the 
anti-HER2  therapies  are  safe  and  effective.  Occasionally  patients 
experience allergic reactions to an initial cycle of trastuzumab, but 
these usually do not recur. Trastuzumab can cause cardiac muscle 
dysfunction, although it is rare to observe symptomatic congestive 
heart failure from adjuvant trastuzumab. Baseline and serial echoc-
ardiographic  monitoring  is  indicated.  Patients  with  a  past  history 
of cardiac abnormalities should not receive trastuzumab or should 
be  followed  and  treated  by  a  cardiologist  with  experience  in  this 
condition. Pertuzumab is associated with loose stools and diarrhea, 
which  can  usually  be  managed  with  antidiarrheal  therapy,  such 
as  loperamide.  The  chemotherapy  payload  of  ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine can cause thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy. 
Skeletal  Strengthening  Agents  Bone-strengthening  agents  that 
are  commonly  used  to  treat  osteoporosis,  specifically  the  bisphos-
phonates, have some limited activity in preventing recurrent breast 
cancer to bone, particularly in postmenopausal women. In addition, 
bisphosphonate therapy also reduced breast cancer mortality in this 
subgroup. The benefit is not significantly associated with any specific 
bisphosphonate  class,  treatment  schedule,  ER  status,  nodal  status, 
tumor grade, or concomitant chemotherapy. As expected, bone frac-
tures  are  reduced  (relative  risk  [RR]  0.85;  95%  confidence  interval 
[CI] 0.75–0.97; 2 p = .02). Joint guidelines from the American Society 
of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario recommend “that, if 
available,  zoledronic  acid  (4  mg  intravenously  every  6  months)  or 
clodronate (1,600 mg/d orally) be considered as adjuvant therapy for 
postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who are deemed candi-
dates for adjuvant systemic therapy. Further research comparing dif-
ferent bone-modifying agents, doses, dosing intervals, and durations 
is required.” The rank-ligand inhibitor denosumab does not prevent 
relapse in bone or other sites, nor does it reduce mortality. 
Novel  Adjuvant  Systemic  Agents  Other  exciting  adjuvant  strat-
egies are being tested (Table 79-1). These include PARP inhibitors 
(olaparib,  talazoparib)  in  patients  with  known  germline  BRCA1 
or  BRCA2  mutations  or  those  with  triple-negative  cancers  that 
share  similar  defects  in  DNA  repair  in  their  etiology.  Likewise, 
the  mTOR  inhibitor  everolimus  and  the  CDK4/6  inhibitors  (pal-
bociclib,  ribociclib,  abemociclib)  are  being  tested  in  the  adjuvant 
setting in combination with antiestrogen therapy. The remarkable 
results of immune checkpoint inhibitors in other cancers have led 
to studies of this approach in both metastatic and post-neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy settings. Their activity with chemotherapy in triple- 
negative disease appears promising. 

STAGE III BREAST CANCER
Ten  to  25%  of  patients  present  with  so-called  locally  advanced 
or  stage  III  breast  cancer  at  diagnosis.  Many  of  these  cancers  are 
technically operable (T3), whereas others, particularly cancers with 
chest  wall  involvement,  inflammatory  breast  cancers,  or  cancers 
with  large  matted  axillary  lymph  nodes  (T4  or  N2-3),  cannot  be 
managed  with  surgery  initially.  Neoadjuvant  downstaging  facil-
itates  local  therapy.  Radiotherapy  either  to  the  chest  wall  after 
mastectomy or to the breast after tumor excision is almost always 
recommended, as is regional lymph node treatment. Adjuvant anti-
HER2 and endocrine therapies are also used as appropriate. These 
patients should be managed in multimodality clinics to coordinate 
local  and  systemic  therapies.  Such  approaches  produce  long-term 
disease-free survival in ~30–50% of patients. 

SIMULTANEOUS NEW PRIMARY WITH DETECTABLE 
METASTASES
In the screening era, only a small fraction of patients (~5%) present 
with a new primary lesion and simultaneous metastases, detected 
either  due  to  symptoms  of  distant  disease  or  because  they  had 
staging scans due to locally advanced disease. Several retrospective 
single-institutional  experiences  have  suggested  that  neoadjuvant 
systemic  therapy  followed  by  local  therapy  (breast  surgery  and 

radiation) is associated with prolonged survival. However, two pro-
spective randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any survival 
benefit. Currently, local therapy for such patients is considered on 
a case-by-case basis depending on the response to systemic therapy 
and the patient’s overall performance status and desires.

BREAST CANCER SURVIVORSHIP ISSUES
The  odds  of  surviving  breast  cancer  have  increased  dramatically 
over the past 35 years due to a combination of early detection and 
more  effective  therapies.  Without  these  advances,  >60,000  Amer-
ican women would have suffered breast cancer mortality in 2020, 
and over one-quarter million women are alive who would not have 
been  otherwise.  Coupled  with  the  women  who  would  have  been 
cured even before the impressive advances of the past three decades, 
millions  are  breast  cancer  survivors.  Thus,  all  clinicians,  not  just 
oncologists, need to be aware of survivorship issues in patients with 
previously diagnosed and treated breast cancer.

At  present,  no  special  follow-up  procedures,  such  as  serial  cir-
culating tumor biomarkers or systemic radiographic/scintigraphic 
imaging, are indicated in an asymptomatic patient with no physical 
findings of recurrence. Although randomized trials have demonstrated 
slightly higher incidence of detection of metastases with lead times of  
3–12  months  by  surveillance  of  asymptomatic  patients  compared 
to no special follow-up, no evidence suggests that earlier detection 
improves overall survival. If anything, such surveillance may worsen 
quality of life due to higher anxiety levels associated with the testing 
and toxicities associated with earlier treatment in patients who were 
otherwise doing well at that time.

However,  the  risk  of  late  metastases  in  breast  cancer  survivors 
is  small  but  real,  especially  those  who  had  ER-positive  disease. 
These patients remain at risk for distant recurrence for at least 20 
years after initial diagnosis, and probably lifelong. The annual risk 
is relentless, ranging from 0.5% per year for patients with initially 
negative lymph nodes and grade 1 tumors <1 cm to as high as 3% 
per year for those who initially had multiple positive lymph nodes. 
Therefore,  especially  in  patients  with  prior  ER-positive  cancers, 
the  physician  must  carefully  assess  and  evaluate  new  symptoms, 
considering  whether  they  might  be  due  to  the  cancer,  the  treat-
ment,  or  an  unassociated  condition.  Judgment  needs  to  be  used 
to decide if blood tests or imaging are required in order to avoid 
missing a lesion for which appropriate treatment would improve 
the  patient’s  quality  of  life  but  also  to  diminish  overtesting,  with 
associated inconvenience, anxieties, false-positive results, and cost. 
Serial echocardiography should be performed every 3 months for 
patients on adjuvant trastuzumab, but not after it is discontinued.
Several observations suggest that perhaps the recommendations 
not to do intensive surveillance in patients without signs or symp-
toms of recurrence might need to be reconsidered. First, the unre-
lenting annual incidence of long-term distant recurrence for patients 
with  ER-positive  disease  demonstrates  that  none  of  these  patients 
can ever be considered free of risk of metastases. Second, available 
diagnostic tests have become substantially more sophisticated in the 
past decade. These include the advent of liquid biopsies beyond just 
circulating  protein  markers,  such  as  circulating  tumor  DNA  and 
circulating tumor cells, as well as more sensitive and specific scinti-
graphic and imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomog-
raphy. Finally, the identification of several highly effective targeted 
therapies, including new endocrine, anti-HER2, and other therapies, 
provides opportunities to deliver more beneficial and less toxic ther-
apies than the few chemotherapeutic and endocrine agents that were 
available  at  the  time  the  older  randomized  trials  were  performed 
(Table  79-1).  Ongoing  trials  are  addressing  whether  incorporating 
these  new  technologies  and  treatments  might  improve  survival  as 
opposed  to  waiting  for  emerging  symptoms  to  initiate  additional 
treatment strategies. At present, no clear answers are apparent.

Likewise,  serial  monitoring  for  long-term,  life-threatening  tox-
icities associated with chemotherapy, such as myelodysplastic syn-
dromes or congestive heart failure, is not warranted since these are 
quite uncommon and likely to cause obvious symptoms requiring 
proper evaluation if they occur.

21/01/22   3:49 PM

PART 4Oncology and HematologyFor patients on endocrine therapy, quality-of-life issues may be 
critical,  including  hot  flashes,  sexual  difficulties,  musculoskeletal 
complaints,  and  risk  of  osteoporosis.  Although  estrogen  therapy, 
given  orally,  transdermally,  or  transvaginally,  effectively  reduces 
these side effects, careful consideration should be given for estrogen 
replacement therapy to these patients because it may counteract the 
efficacy of the endocrine therapy. Locally administered therapies are 
often very effective and likely less risky. Nonhormonal treatments, 
such as selected antidepressants for hot flashes and musculoskeletal 
symptoms,  and  counseling  and  water-based  lubricants  for  sexual 
issues  can  be  quite  helpful.  It  is  important  to  screen  bone  density 
in  patients  on  an  AI  more  frequently  than  is  recommended  for 
the average postmenopausal woman, since total estrogen depletion 
results  in  enhanced  risk  of  osteoporosis  and  risk  of  fracture.  All 
women  should  be  counseled  to  take  daily  calcium  and  vitamin  D 
replacement, and if osteoporosis is present or osteopenia is worsen-
ing, bone-strengthening agents should be administered.

METASTATIC DISEASE
Diagnostic  Considerations  (Fig.  79-3)  About  15–20%  of  patients 
treated  for  localized  breast  cancer  develop  metastatic  disease  in 
the  subsequent  decade  after  diagnosis.  Soft  tissue,  bone,  and  vis-
ceral  (lung  and  liver)  metastases  each  account  for  approximately 
one-third of sites of initial relapses. However, by the time of death, 
most patients will have bone involvement. Recurrences can appear 
at any time after primary therapy, but at least half occur >5 years 
after initial therapy, especially in patients with ER-positive disease. 
A variety of host factors can influence recurrence rates, including 
depression and central obesity, and these diseases should be man-
aged as aggressively as possible.

For patients with no prior history of metastases, a biopsy of suspi-
cious physical or radiographic lesions should be performed for con-
firmation that the lesion does represent recurrent cancer. One should 
not assume that an apparent abnormality is a breast cancer metastasis. 
Many benign conditions, such as tuberculosis, gallstones, sarcoidosis, 

hyperparathyroidism, or other nonmalignant diseases, can mimic a 
recurrent  breast  cancer  and  are  of  course  treated  much  differently. 
Moreover,  if  biopsy  is  positive  for  metastases,  re-evaluation  of  ER 
and HER2 is indicated, since these can differ between the primary 
and  metastatic  lesions  in  up  to  15%  of  cases.  Analysis  for PIK3CA 
mutations should be performed if the cancer is ER positive. Predic-
tors  of  immune  checkpoint  inhibitor  susceptibility,  such  as  PD-L1 
expression, should be determined in triple-negative metastatic breast 
cancers  (Table  79-1).  Many  experts  are  also  recommending  some 
form  of  next-generation  sequencing  of  all  metastatic  cancers  from 
any site, although this recommendation is controversial.

Once a recurrence/metastasis is established, some form of body 
imaging  should  be  performed—either  a  scintigraphic  bone  scan 
and  chest  and  abdomen  CT  scan  or  a  positron  emission  tomog-
raphy  (PET)/CT  scan,  depending  on  caregiver’s  preference.  Brain 
scanning (CT or MRI) is not indicated in the absence of any cog-
nitive or neurologic signs or symptoms in most patients. However, 
because  of  increased  risk  of  brain  metastases  in  HER2-positive 
breast cancer, some experts do recommend central nervous system 
(CNS) imaging in such patients even in the absence of clinical indi-
cations.  Regardless,  body  scans  provide  a  perspective  of  extent  of 
disease, which may guide therapeutic decisions, as well as the need 
for ancillary treatments, such as bone-modifying agents if skeletal 
metastases are present.
Considerations  Regarding  Goals  of  Therapy  Although  treatable, 
metastatic disease is rarely if ever cured. The median survival for 
all patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer is <3 years, but 
with  remarkable  variability  depending  on  intrinsic  subtype  and 
treatment  effects.  Patients  with  triple-negative  metastatic  breast 
cancer  have  the  shortest  expected  survival,  whereas  those  with 
ER-positive disease can expect to live the longest. HER2 positivity 
was initially found to be a very poor prognostic factor in metastatic 
breast cancer, but the availability of several effective targeted treat-
ments has improved the expected survival rates to at least those of 
ER-positive patients, if not better.

The overall goal of treatment of metastatic disease is palliation 
or, put simply, to “keep the patient feeling as well as she can for as 
long  as  she  can.”  A  secondary  goal  is  improved  survival.  Overall 
survival has not been improved by advocating more aggressive or 
toxic  therapies,  such  as  high-dose  or  combination  chemotherapy, 
but rather by using more selective and biologically based therapy, 
including endocrine or anti-HER2 therapies in patients with ER- or 
HER2-positive breast cancers, respectively.

Generally, a new treatment is continued until either progression 
or unacceptable toxicities are evident. These are both evaluated by 
serial  history  and  physical  examinations  and  periodic  serologic 
evaluation  for  hematologic  or  hepatic  abnormalities,  as  well  as 
circulating  tumor  biomarker  tests  (assays  for  MUC1  [CA15-3  or 
CA27.29] and for carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and occasion-
ally  CA125).  If  all  these  evaluations  fail  to  suggest  progression,  it 
is  unlikely  that  imaging  will  contribute.  However,  if  one  or  more 
of these suggest progression, whole-body imaging with whichever 
modality(ies) was used at baseline is indicated.

The  choice  of  therapy  requires  consideration  of  local  therapy 
needs,  specifically  surgical  approaches  to  particularly  worrisome 
long-bone lytic lesions or isolated CNS metastases. New back pain 
in  patients  with  breast  cancer  should  be  explored  aggressively 
on  an  emergent  basis,  usually  with  a  spine  MRI;  to  wait  for  neu-
rologic  symptoms  is  a  potentially  catastrophic  error.  Metastatic 
involvement of endocrine organs can occasionally cause profound 
dysfunction,  including  adrenal  insufficiency  and  hypopituitarism. 
Similarly,  obstruction  of  the  biliary  tree  or  other  impaired  organ 
function may be better managed with a local therapy than with a 
systemic approach. Radiation as an adjunct to or instead of surgery 
is an important consideration for particularly symptomatic disease 
in  long  or  vertebral  bones,  locoregional  recurrences,  and  CNS 
metastases. In many cases, systemic therapy can be withheld while 
the patient is managed with appropriate local therapy.

Aggressive local treatment, such as excision, radiation, radiofre-
quency ablation, or cryotherapy of metastases to the lung, liver, or 
other distant sites, does not improve survival. Although appealing, 
these strategies are associated with increased toxicity and cost and 
should be reserved for palliation.

Locoregional recurrence on the chest wall or surrounding lymph 
nodes is an exception to this principle. Some of these lesions may 
well  represent  new  primary  cancers,  even  in  the  case  of  prior 
mastectomy, since some residual at-risk normal tissue can remain. 
Regardless, rendering the patient disease-free by surgery and radi-
ation, if appropriate, followed by adjuvant systemic therapy, such as 
endocrine therapy if the cancer is ER positive, or chemotherapy if 
ER negative, is indicated. Anti-HER therapy is also appropriate if 
the cancer is HER2 positive.

Selection of the systemic therapy strategy depends on the overall 
medical condition of the patient, the hormone receptor and HER2 
status of the tumor, and clinical judgment. Because therapy of sys-
temic disease is palliative, the potential toxicities of therapies should 
be balanced against expected response rates. Several variables influ-
ence  the  response  to  systemic  therapy.  For  example,  the  presence 
of  ER  and  PgR  is  a  strong  indication  for  endocrine  therapy,  even 
for patients with limited visceral (lung/liver) disease. On the other 
hand, patients with short disease-free intervals or rapidly progres-
sive  visceral  disease  (liver  and  lung)  with  end-organ  dysfunction, 
such as lymphangitic pulmonary disease, are unlikely to respond to 
endocrine therapy.

Many patients with bone-only or bone-dominant disease have a 
relatively indolent course. Because the goal of therapy is to maintain 
well-being  for  as  long  as  possible,  emphasis  should  be  placed  on 
avoiding  the  most  hazardous  complications  of  metastatic  disease, 
including pathologic fracture of the axial skeleton and spinal cord 
compression.  Under  such  circumstances,  systemic  chemotherapy 
has a modest effect, whereas radiation therapy may be effective for 
long periods. Patients with bone involvement should receive con-
current bone-strengthening agents, such as bisphosphonates or the 
humanized  monoclonal  anti-RANK  ligand  antibody  denosumab. 

These  therapies  have  been  proven  to  reduce  bone  pain,  fractures, 
and hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Many  patients  are  inappropriately  treated  with  toxic  regimens 
into their last days of life. Often, oncologists are unwilling to have 
the  difficult  conversations  that  are  required  with  patients  nearing 
the  end  of  life,  and  not  uncommonly,  patients  and  families  can 
pressure physicians into treatments with very little survival value. 
Although  systemic  therapy  is  designed  to  deliver  palliation,  for-
mal  palliative  care  consultation  and  realistic  assessment  of  treat-
ment expectations need to be reviewed with patients and families. 
We  urge  consideration  of  formal  palliative  care  consultations  for 
patients who have received at least two lines of therapy for meta-
static disease.
SYSTEMIC TREATMENTS FOR METASTATIC  
BREAST CANCER
Endocrine  Therapy  (Table  79-1)  Approximately  30–70%  of 
patients with ER-positive breast cancer will benefit from endocrine 
therapy. Potential endocrine therapies are summarized in Table 79-1. 
Available strategies include SERMs (tamoxifen, toremifene), the AIs 
(anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane), and the selective estrogen recep-
tor downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant. Additive endocrine therapies, 
including  treatment  with  progestins  and  androgens  and,  enigmati-
cally, pharmacologic doses of estrogens, are all active, but they may 
be associated with unacceptable side effects in many women and are 
rarely used. Tamoxifen withdrawal (as well as withdrawal of pharma-
cologic  doses  of  estrogens)  induces  responses  in  ~15%  of  patients, 
but with the advent of so many other therapies for metastatic disease, 
this strategy is also rarely used in modern oncology.

The  sequence  of  endocrine  therapy  is  variable.  Patients  who 
respond  to  one  endocrine  therapy  have  at  least  a  50%  chance  of 
responding to a second endocrine therapy. It is not uncommon for 
patients to respond to two or three sequential endocrine therapies. 
Many, but not all, women with ER-positive breast cancer who suffer 
a recurrence will do so either while still taking or after recently dis-
continuing a prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (either tamoxifen or 
an AI). In most postmenopausal patients, if they have never received 
an  AI  or  discontinued  adjuvant  AI  many  years  before  recurrence, 
the  initial  endocrine  therapy  should  be  an  AI  rather  than  tamox-
ifen. As noted, AIs are not used in women with functioning ovaries 
because their hypothalamus can respond to estrogen deprivation by 
producing gonadotropins that promote ovarian estrogen synthesis. 
Fulvestrant is usually used in sequence after AI therapy. Compared 
to  single-agent  therapy,  combination  endocrine  therapies  increase 
the chances of response, but they do not appear to increase the ulti-
mate time to chemotherapy use or overall survival. Combinations of 
chemotherapy with endocrine therapy are not useful.

Over the past decade, several different targeted agents have been 
shown to enhance outcomes of patients with ER-positive metastatic 
breast cancer when combined with endocrine therapy (Table 79-1). 
Addition of an inhibitor of mTOR, everolimus, to endocrine therapy 
improves  time  to  progression.  Everolimus  is  commonly  associated 
with mucositis, which can be prevented or alleviated by use of dex-
amethasone-containing  mouthwash.  Diarrhea  is  also  a  common 
side effect and can be lessened with antidiarrheal medications such 
as loperamide.

Inhibitors of CDK4/6 (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) also 
substantially  improve  progression-free  survival,  and  even  overall 
survival  when  combined  either  with  an  AI  or  fulvestrant  (Table 
79-1).  Most  experts  now  recommend  a  CDK4/6  inhibitor  with 
endocrine  therapy  as  first-line  therapy  for  ER-positive  metastatic 
disease.  They  can  cause  dangerous  neutropenia,  although  rarely 
to the extent seen with chemotherapy. Nonetheless, absolute neu-
trophil  counts  need  to  be  monitored  closely  with  appropriate 
adjustments in dose and schedule. Fatigue is also an occasional side 
effect,  and  abemaciclib  frequently  causes  diarrhea.  Similarly,  an 
inhibitor  of  PIK3CA  protein,  alpelisib,  prolongs  progression-free 
survival  in  patients  whose  cancers  harbor  activating  mutations  of 
this gene. Like everolimus, it too causes mouth sores and diarrhea.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyThese targeted agents should not be given simultaneously but rather 
in sequence as appropriate.

Chemotherapy  Unlike many other epithelial malignancies, breast 
cancer  responds  to  multiple  chemotherapeutic  agents,  including 
anthracyclines,  alkylating  agents,  taxanes,  and  antimetabolites. 
Multiple combinations of these agents have been found to improve 
response rates somewhat, but they have had little effect on duration 
of  response  or  survival.  Unless  patients  have  rapidly  progressive 
visceral  (lung,  liver)  metastases  with  end-organ  dysfunction,  sin-
gle-agent chemotherapy is preferable, used in sequence as one drug 
fails  going  on  to  the  next.  Given  the  significant  toxicity  of  most 
drugs,  the  use  of  a  single-agent  therapy  will  minimize  toxicity  by 
sparing the patient exposure to drugs that would be of little value. 
No method to select the drugs most efficacious for a given patient 
has been demonstrated to be useful.

Most oncologists use capecitabine, an anthracycline, or a taxane 
for  first-line  chemotherapy,  either  in  a  patient  with  ER-positive 
disease that is refractory to endocrine therapy or for a patient with 
ER-negative breast cancer. Within these general classes, one partic-
ular agent is no more preferable than another (such as doxorubicin 
vs epirubicin or paclitaxel vs docetaxel), and the choice has to be 
balanced with individual needs. Objective responses in previously 
treated  patients  may  also  be  seen  with  gemcitabine,  vinorelbine, 
and oral etoposide, as well as a newer class of agents, epothilones. 
Platinum-based agents have become far more widely used in both 
the adjuvant and advanced disease settings for some breast cancers, 
particularly those of the triple-negative subtype.

Anti-HER2 Therapy (Table 79-1) 
Initial use of a trastuzumab, either 
alone  or  with  chemotherapy,  improves  response  rate,  progression- 
free  survival,  and  even  overall  survival  for  women  with  HER2- 
positive disease. Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that, on occasion, 
a few patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer may be 
cured. Addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab is more effective than 
trastuzumab alone. The antibody-drug conjugate, ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine,  is  effective  after  progression  on  trastuzumab.  Another 
antibody-drug  conjugate,  fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki,  has 
been shown to be active even in patients who have progressed on 
multiple  other  anti-HER2  therapies,  including  ado-trastuzumab 
emtansine. A monoclonal antibody, margetuximab, has been engi-
neered  to  specifically  enhance  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity against tumor cells overexpressing HER2. In a phase 3 
trial, margetuximab plus chemotherapy improved overall survival by 
1.8 months compared with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.

Inhibitors of the HER2 tyrosine kinase domain also have activity 
against  HER2-positive  breast  cancers.  Lapatinib  is  effective  when 
added to chemotherapy after patients progressed on trastuzumab. 
In  addition,  even  after  progression  on  trastuzumab,  combination 
trastuzumab  and  lapatinib  is  superior  to  lapatinib  alone.  When 
added to oral capecitabine, neratinib is more effective than lapatinib 
in patients who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based reg-
imens.  In  patients  with  heavily  pretreated  HER2-positive  disease, 
including those with brain metastases, adding tucatinib to trastu-
zumab and capecitabine resulted in better progression-free survival 
and  overall  survival  outcomes  than  adding  placebo.  Of  interest, 
2–3%  of  breast  cancers  that  do  not  amplify  or  overexpress  HER2 
contain activating mutations in the gene encoding for it. Preclinical 
models and preliminary trials suggest that neratinib is particularly 
active against this mutation.

PARP  Inhibitors  (Table  79-1)  PARP  inhibitors  induce  synthetic 
lethality of cancer cells with inactive BRCA1/2 or cancers that have 
BRCA-like  biology  by  virtue  of  an  ineffective  homologous  recom-
bination DNA repair mechanism. Both olaparib and tolaparib have 
been  approved  for  patients  whose  cancers  have  developed  in  the 
context of germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Both agents, given as a sin-
gle agent, are as effective as standard chemotherapy, but in general, 
they are less toxic. Unfortunately, responses are relatively short lived. 
PARP  inhibitors  are  now  being  investigated  in  combination  with

chemotherapy and with immune checkpoint inhibitors. PARP inhibi-
tors can cause mild nausea and occasional vomiting as well as fatigue.
Sacituzumab Govitecan (Table 79-1)  An antibody-drug conjugate, 
sacituzumab govitecan, showed activity in a nonrandomized trial of 
patients with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer. Sacituzumab 
govitecan  combines  a  humanized  immunoglobulin  G  antibody 
targeted against TROP-2SN-38 with the active metabolite of irino-
tecan. In a single-arm, phase 2 trial, this agent elicited responses in 
one-third of such patients.
Immune  Checkpoint  Inhibitors  (Table  79-1)  These  therapies  per-
mit  immune  effector  cells  to  recognize  and  eliminate  host  cancer 
cells based on their recognition of neoantigen expression in tumor 
cells  due  to  chromosomal  instability  and  accumulated  mutations. 
The excitement over immune checkpoint inhibitors has spread to 
metastatic  breast  cancer,  especially  of  the  triple-negative  subtype. 
Atezolizumab  in  combination  with  nab-paclitaxel  improves  pro-
gression-free  and  perhaps  overall  survival,  although  exclusively 
against cancers with infiltrating immune cells that express PD-L1 
(Table 79-1). The side effects of these agents can be life threatening, 
consisting  of  induction  of  inflammatory  autoimmune  responses 
in nearly every organ imaginable. These include thyroiditis, pneu-
monitis,  myo-  and  pericarditis,  esophagitis,  gastritis  and  colitis, 
hepatitis, pancreatitis, hypophysitis, and dermatitis. The endocrine 
toxicities  tend  to  be  irreversible.  Careful  management  should  be 
handled by an experienced team.
Bone-Modifying  Agents  Bone-modifying  agents,  such  as  bis-
phosphonates  or  the  anti-RANK  antibody  denosumab,  are  rec-
ommended  for  all  patients  with  bone  metastases.  These  agents 
substantially reduce the incidence of cancer-related skeletal events, 
such as bone pain, fracture, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. The 
bisphosphonates may cause myalgias and skeletal pain lasting a few 
hours  to  days  after  infusion.  Both  strategies  have  been  associated 
with  osteonecrosis  of  the  jaw.  The  incidence  of  this  complication 
is  reduced  by  ensuring  adequate  dentition  before  treatment  and 
by  delivering  treatment  every  3  months,  instead  of  monthly.  The 
former has been shown to have equal efficacy.

BREAST CANCER IN PREGNANCY
As noted, breast cancer is unusual during pregnancy but does occur. 
Because  of  pregnancy-related  physical  breast  changes,  diagnosis  is 
frequently  delayed.  Workup  is  the  same  as  for  non-pregnancy- 
related breast cancers, except radiographic staging should be limited 
or avoided, especially of the abdomen. Prognosis is similar, stage for 
stage, as that for age-matched women who are not pregnant. Preg-
nancy  termination  is  usually  not  required.  However,  it  is  strongly 
advised that the patient be referred to a high-risk pregnancy program.
Remarkably,  adjuvant  chemotherapy  including  doxorubicin  and 
cyclophosphamide  can  be  safely  given  beyond  the  first  trimester. 
Taxanes and the platinum salts may be administered safely. In con-
trast,  anti-HER2  antibody  therapies  have  resulted  in  unacceptable 
fetal  malformations  and  pregnancy  complications  and  should  be 
avoided. Likewise, endocrine therapies should be delayed until after 
delivery. In general, a reasonable strategy is to deliver combination 
neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  with  either  concurrent  or  sequential 
single agents to permit sufficient embryogenesis followed by deliv-
ery  and  then  breast  primary  therapy  (surgery/radiation).  Further 
adjuvant therapies, including additional chemotherapy and/or anti–
HER2  and  endocrine  therapies  can  be  delivered  postoperatively. 
Breast feeding is discouraged, since these agents may cross into milk.

MALE BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer is ~1/150th as frequent in men as in women; ~2000 
men  developed  breast  cancer  annually  in  the  United  States.  Risk 
factors  include  inherited  deleterious  SNPs  in  BRCA2,  as  well  as 
increased  exposure  to  endogenous  or  exogenous  estrogen.  Men 
with Klinefelter’s syndrome have two or more copies of the X chro-
mosome  and  have  higher  levels  of  estrogen.  Other  conditions  of 
hyperestrogenism,  such  as  in  hepatic  failure  and  with  exogenous 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   625

estrogen  use  in  transgender  situations,  are  also  associated  with 
higher  risk  of  male  breast  cancers.  However,  the  vast  majority  of 
men who present with breast cancer have none of these conditions.
Breast  cancer  usually  presents  in  men  as  a  unilateral  lump  in 
the  breast  and  is  frequently  not  diagnosed  promptly.  Given  the 
small amount of soft tissue and the unexpected nature of the prob-
lem, locally advanced presentations are somewhat more common. 
Although gynecomastia may initially be unilateral or asymmetric, 
any  unilateral  mass  in  a  man  >40  years  old  should  be  biopsied. 
On the other hand, bilateral symmetric breast development rarely 
represents breast cancer and is almost invariably due to endocrine 
disease  or  a  drug  effect.  Nevertheless,  the  risk  of  cancer  is  much 
greater in men with gynecomastia; in such men, gross asymmetry 
of the breasts should arouse suspicion of cancer.

Approximately  90%  of  male  breast  cancers  contain  ERs,  and 
the disease behaves similarly to that in a postmenopausal woman. 
When matched to female breast cancer by age and stage, its over-
all  prognosis  is  identical.  Male  breast  cancer  is  best  managed  by 
mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection or SLNB, although 
some  men  prefer  breast-conserving  therapy.  Patients  with  locally 
advanced disease or positive nodes should also be treated with irra-
diation. No randomized studies have evaluated adjuvant therapy for 
male breast cancer, but extrapolation from treatment with women 
suggests it is indicated. If the cancer is ER positive, which is often 
the case, tamoxifen is usually the agent of choice. AIs are also effec-
tive in men. Anecdotal evidence supports use of gonadotropin-re-
leasing hormones, such as leuprolide, in combination with an AI, 
since testosterone is a substrate for the aromatase enzyme. The sites 
of relapse and spectrum of response to chemotherapeutic drugs are 
virtually identical for breast cancers in either sex.

80 Upper Gastrointestinal  
Tract Cancers
David Kelsen

Cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract include malignancies of the 
esophagus,  stomach,  and  small  bowel.  Esophageal,  gastroesophageal 
junction, and gastric cancers are among the most common of human 
malignancies, with 1.5 million global new cases diagnosed in 2018. In 
the United States, a lower risk area, it is estimated that in 2020, esopha-
geal cancer will be diagnosed in 18,440 people and cause 16,170 deaths; 
for  gastric  cancer,  27,600  new  cases  will  be  diagnosed  and  11,010 
deaths will occur. Small intestine cancers are rare.

ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
 ■ INCIDENCE AND CAUSATIVE FACTORS
Two distinct forms of cancer with different epidemiologies, causative 
factors,  and  genomic  profiles  arise  within  the  esophagus:  squamous 
cell cancers, which occur more frequent in the upper and mid esoph-
agus;  and  adenocarcinomas,  which  are  almost  always  located  in  the 
lower esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction. The incidence 
of esophageal cancer varies up to 20-fold based on geographic distri-
bution:  it  is  relatively  uncommon  in  North  America,  but  has  a  high 
incidence  in  Asia  (especially  China),  the  Normandy  coast  of  France, 
and Middle Eastern countries such as Iran. This marked global vari-
ation is likely due to different causative factors in the development of 
the malignancy, leading to two different cancer types within the same 
tissue:  squamous  cell  cancers  are  more  common  in  high-incidence 
areas, usually with lower Human Development Index (HDI) scores (a 
measure  of  economic  development  that  includes  standard  of  living, 
health,  and  education).  Overall,  approximately  572,000  new  cases  of 
esophageal cancer were diagnosed globally in 2018; esophageal cancer 
was the seventh most common cause of malignancy and the third most 
common cause of cancer-related mortality, with an estimated 508,000 
deaths.

The clearest high-risk factors for the squamous cell cancer subtype 
in Western countries are alcohol and tobacco abuse; concurrent alcohol 
and  tobacco  abuse  further  increases  the  risk.  Ingestion  of  extremely 
hot substances (such as tea in Iran and mate [maté] in South America) 
has been proposed as a risk factor; in India, chewing the areca (betel) 
nut increases the risk of esophageal squamous cell cancers. Less com-
mon risk factors include chronic achalasia, radiation therapy (such as 
is  delivered  for  treatment  of  Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  or  breast  cancer), 
lye ingestion, and Plummer-Vinson (Patterson-Kelly) syndrome (iron 
deficiency anemia, glossitis, cheilosis, and the development of esopha-
geal webs) (Table 80-1). Adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus and 
gastroesophageal  junction  has  been  the  predominant  histologic  sub-
type in the United States and Western Europe for several decades, now 
making up >75% of all incident cases. Risk factors for adenocarcinoma 
(Table 80-2) include chronic reflux esophagitis leading to inflamma-
tion and the development of Barrett’s esophagus (the finding of glan-
dular  gastric  type  mucosa  extending  into  the  esophagus).  Although 
obesity  increases  the  risk  of  reflux  esophagitis,  a  substantial  number 
of  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  adenocarcinoma  of  the  esophagus 
and gastroesophageal junction are younger and fit; Barrett’s esophagus 
may still be found in these patients. In patients with adenocarcinoma 
of the lower esophagus in which Barrett’s esophagus is not present, the 
disease may arise without Barrett’s esophagus, or an extensive tumor 
found at diagnosis may obliterate previous areas of Barrett’s. Genomic 
alterations  may  be  identified  even  before  the  development  of  frank 
adenocarcinoma  in  patients  with  dysplasia  associated  with  Barrett’s 
esophagus. These include mutations of TP53, a gene critical in regu-
lating uncontrolled cell division, and aneuploidy in dysplastic regions. 
Risk of progression of Barrett’s esophagus to cancer is about 0.4–0.5% 
per year. Management of Barrett’s esophagus is discussed in Chap. 323.

Cancer of the Esophagus
Excess alcohol consumption

et plantaris)
? Dietary deficiencies of selenium, molybdenum, zinc, and vitamin A

As opposed to other gastrointestinal malignancies, such as colorec-
tal  cancer,  inherited  cancer  susceptibility  genes  are  rarely  associated 
with esophagus and gastroesophageal junction cancers. An exception 
is the rare inherited cancer susceptibility gene driving tylosis palmaris 
and  plantaris;  a  mutation  in  the  RHBDF2  gene  is  associated  with  an 
increased  risk  for  squamous  cell  cancers  of  the  esophagus.  Lynch 
syndrome  modestly  increases  the  risk  of  gastric  and  potentially  gas-
troesophageal junction adenocarcinomas.
 ■ SCREENING AND SURVEILLANCE OF HIGHER 
RISK GROUPS
Because  of  its  low  incidence  in  North  America  and  the  absence  of 
proven blood-based biomarker for esophageal cancer assays, screening 
of the asymptomatic general population using, e.g., upper endoscopy 
is  not  currently  recommended  in  the  United  States.  Periodic  endos-
copy is used for surveillance of higher risk patients, such as those with  
Barrett’s  esophagus  and  especially  with  dysplasia,  based  on  expert 
opinion guidelines.
 ■ GENOMIC ALTERATIONS
Within a tissue, subtyping has revealed substantial genomic differences 
between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancers of the esophagus. 
An  integrated  analysis  involving  several  different  genomic  platforms 
performed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network 
investigators  demonstrated  that  esophageal  squamous  cell  cancers 
more  closely  resembled  squamous  cell  carcinomas  of  other  primary 
sites,  such  as  the  head  and  neck,  than  adenocarcinomas  arising  in 
the  esophagus.  Three  molecular  subclasses  of  squamous  cell  cancer 
were  identified  (of  note,  as  opposed  to  squamous  cell  cancer  of  the 
head and neck, human papillomavirus was not identified in any of the 
three subgroups). Among other differences, the spectrum of genomic 
amplifications  in  squamous  cell  cancers  are  substantially  different 
than  that  of  adenocarcinomas.  In  adenocarcinomas,  ERBB2  (HER2) 
was frequently amplified, as were VEGFA and GATA4/6. The genomic 
profile for esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas 
was  very  similar  to  the  chromosomally  unstable  variant  of  gastric

adenocarcinoma,  suggesting  that  proximal  gastric  and  gastroesoph-
ageal  junction  tumors  may  have  a  similar  driving  factor  (see  below). 
Other  studies  comparing  transcriptomes  of  adenocarcinomas  and 
squamous  cell  cancers  across  tissues  (i.e.,  the  same  tumor  histology 
arising in different organs, such as squamous cell cancers and adeno-
carcinomas from the esophagus, lung, and uterine cervix) found that 
histologies  among  the  different  organs  showed  more  similarity  than 
between the different histologies within the same organ. In addition to 
implications regarding driving factors in the initiation and progression 
of cancer, these genomic alterations are important for therapeutic deci-
sions involving systemic agents given in the neoadjuvant or postopera-
tive adjuvant setting or for advanced metastatic disease. For esophageal 
cancer, genomic abnormalities that should be considered in prescribing 
drug-based  therapy  include  analysis  for  HER2  amplification,  PD-L1 
expression,  and  hypermutated  tumors\microsatellite  instability  (see 
below).

CLINICAL FEATURES
 ■ PRESENTING SYMPTOMS
The most common symptoms leading to suspicion of esophageal can-
cer are dysphagia or odynophagia and, less frequently, hematemesis or 
melena. More subtle symptoms include anorexia and weight loss, and 
fatigue and shortness of breath if anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding 
is  present.  Because  the  symptoms  of  dysphagia  or  odynophagia  are 
usually  not  perceived  by  the  patient  until  substantial  obstruction  of 
the esophageal lumen has occurred, the large majority of patients with 
esophageal  cancer  are  found  with  locally  advanced  if  not  metastatic 
disease.  Patients  with  symptoms  of  dysphagia  and/or  odynophagia 
should undergo upper endoscopy (rather than a barium contrast study) 
to determine the presence or absence of malignancy; biopsy should be 
performed at the same setting to determine histology. Depending on 
the tumor stage, molecular diagnostic or next-generation sequencing 
(NGS)  analysis  to  assist  in  determine  potential  therapies  would  be 
performed.  These  studies  should  be  done  on  all  patients  with  meta-
static  disease  as  it  will  guide  therapy.  NGS  requires  adequate  tumor 
cellularity,  which  is  sometimes  difficult  to  achieve  from  endoscopic 
biopsy. Some high-volume U.S. centers routinely perform NGS on all 
specimens,  including  from  the  primary  tumor  for  patients  without 
metastatic disease.

 ■ STAGING
Therapeutic strategy is based on the stage of the disease using a system 
such as the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system. The T stage is 
based on the size of the tumor and depth of penetration through the 
esophageal wall (which for most of its course is not covered by serosa 
so that invasion through the muscle layer leads directly into periesoph-
ageal tissues) (Fig. 80-1). Patients with regional lymph node metastases 
are still potentially curable. Metastatic disease is generally treated with 
palliative intent with rare exceptions. Because neoadjuvant (preopera-
tive) therapy is widely employed for esophageal cancer in an effort to 
improve subsequent surgical outcomes, the AJCC TNM staging system 
includes clinical, pathologic (for patients undergoing initial surgery as 
first treatment), and ypTNM staging assessment for those treated with 
preoperative therapy. See Table 80-3 for the TNM staging classification 
for gastric cancer, which is similar to esophageal cancer.

Determining  tumor  extent  includes  careful  physical  examination, 
which may reveal palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatomegaly; imaging 
studies including computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose 
(FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan are used to assess 
for metastatic disease. If no metastatic disease is identified, endoscopic 
ultrasonography  (EUS)  is  commonly  performed  to  more  definitively 
determine depth of penetration of the primary tumor (T) and regional 
lymph node involvement. For tumors of the mid and upper esophagus 
(5%  of  esophageal  cancers  are  in  the  upper  third  of  the  esophagus, 
20% in the middle third, and 75% in the lower third), bronchoscopy 
may  be  performed  to  rule  out  invasion  of  the  tracheobronchial  tree.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyThe finding of invasion of the trachea or bronchus rules out surgical 
intervention with curative intent. Regional lymph nodes may be biop-
sied under EUS guidance. If metastatic disease is suspected, biopsy to 
confirm tumor staging and to obtain adequate tissue for molecular and 
genomic alterations analysis should be performed. If systemic therapy 
is indicated as a portion of the treatment (for metastatic disease or for 
preoperative  therapy  for  locally  advanced  cancers),  serial  FDG-PET/
CT  scans,  using  decrease  in  FDG  avidity  as  a  surrogate  measure  of 
effectiveness, are increasingly being used to guide whether the initial 
therapy should be continued or changed.

TREATMENT
Esophageal Cancer

Although  the  prognosis  for  patients  with  esophageal  cancer  (all 
stages) is still poor, a slow but steady improvement in 5-year sur-
vival has been noted. Because no effective early detection methods 
exist, the number of patients found to have very-early-stage cancers 
at  the  time  of  diagnosis  has  not  markedly  increased;  the  modest 
improvement  in  survival  is  probably  a  combination  of  somewhat 
improved systemic therapy as well as decreased operative morbidity 
and mortality when surgery is performed by high-volume surgeons 
at high-volume centers, as well as improvements in the delivery of 
external-beam radiation therapy.

For patients without evidence of metastatic disease, the goal of 
therapy  is  cure,  usually  by  employing  combined-modality  thera-
pies. Except for patients with early-stage esophageal cancer ,which 
might be treated by surgery alone (or for very-early-stage lesions, by 
endomucosal resection alone), systemic drug therapy plus external- 
beam  radiation  therapy  is  a  standard  of  care  option  for  esopha-
geal  cancers.  For  selected  patients  with  gastroesophageal  cancers, 
systemic  therapy  alone  may  be  given  before  definitive  surgical 
resection. For patients with squamous cell cancers of the upper and 
mid esophagus, combined chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation 
therapy  is  a  standard  of  care  option,  with  surgery  reserved  for 
patients  not  achieving  a  complete  radiographic  and  endoscopic 
response. Chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation was superior to 
radiation therapy alone in several clinical trials. Increasingly, all sys-
temic therapy given with curative intent is given before operation, 
although  if  surgery  is  the  initial  therapy  and  the  patient  is  found 
to  have  more  locally  advanced  cancer  at  pathology  (e.g.,  regional 
lymph node metastasis), postoperative systemic therapy is used in 
the  adjuvant  setting.  Adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  more  frequently 
indicated  in  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  than  squamous  cell 
cancers.

For patients with metastatic disease, the goal of therapy is symp-
tom  palliation  and  life  extension.  No  randomized  trials  of  sup-
portive care only versus systemic therapy plus best supportive care 
have been reported in patients with esophageal cancers. For gastric 
cancer (a similar histology as distal esophageal and gastroesopha-
geal junction tumors as discussed above), clinical trials performed 
in the 1980s and 1990s indicated a modest improvement in 1- and 
2-year survival when systemic therapy was initiated versus best sup-
portive care only. While the cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens used 
for palliation have not changed dramatically over the past 10 years, 
subgroups of patients have been identified who benefit from thera-
pies targeting specific genomic alterations. Approximately 20–25% 
of patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesoph-
ageal junction are found to have amplified or overexpressed HER2; 
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy results in higher response rates and 
longer  progression-free  and  overall  survival  compared  to  chemo-
therapy alone. Immune modulation therapy using PD-1 inhibitors 
is second-line palliative therapy for patients who have esophageal 
cancers  expressing  PD-L1  or  having  hypermutated  or  microsatel-
lite-unstable genotype. Molecular diagnostic or genomic alteration 
analysis  assays  to  identify  these  biomarkers  should  be  performed 
routinely  in  patients  with  metastatic  esophageal  cancer  to  help 
guide therapy.

Supportive  measures  to  improve  nutrition  and  quality  of  life 
include  placement  of  an  endoluminal  stent  in  the  setting  of  high-
grade  obstruction;  use  of  enteral  nutrition  can  also  be  performed 
using a percutaneous gastrostomy. Photodynamic therapy and endo-
scopic laser therapy have been used to treat endoluminal obstruction.

TUMORS OF THE STOMACH
 ■ ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE STOMACH
Incidence  and  Causative  Factors  A  century  ago,  gastric  ade-
nocarcinomas were among the most common of malignancies in the 
United States. Since the 1920s, the incidence of gastric cancer has stead-
ily decreased; while the reason for this has not been definitively identi-
fied, it coincided with widespread use of refrigeration and a decreased 
need for food preservatives. In 2020, it is estimated that there will be 
27,600 new cases of gastric cancer diagnosed in the United States; while 
now seen much less frequently, it remains a lethal disease, with 11,010 
deaths.  Globally,  gastric  cancer  is  still  very  common,  with  an  overall 
global incidence of 1.03 million new cases per year and 780,000 deaths, 
making gastric cancer the third most common cause of cancer mortal-
ity. High-incidence areas, as is the case for esophageal cancers, include 
large Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan; South American 
countries such as Chile; and Eastern European countries.

While the number of new cases of body and distal gastric cancers 
has decreased in Western, high-HDI countries, the incidence of ade-
nocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction has markedly increased 
in the same areas over the past several decades. The ingestion of high 
concentrations  of  nitrates  found  in  dried,  smoked,  and  salted  foods 
may be a contributing factor. Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori and 
ingestion of partially decayed bacterially contaminated food may lead 
to  the  generation  of  carcinogenic  nitrites  from  nitrates  (Table  80-4). 
A  causative  factor  is  suspected  to  be  chronic  inflammation  due  to 
reflux  of  gastric  contents  into  the  esophagus,  particularly  in  obese 
people. Obesity alone is not the cause, as a substantial number of these 
patients are fit and not overweight. Early-onset gastric cancers (gastric 
cancer occurring in patients under the age of 50), primarily proximal 
or  gastroesophageal  junction  cancers,  have  also  increased.  A  second 
cause of chronic inflammation, H. pylori infection, is a known driver 
in many cases of gastric cancer. While H. pylori is extremely common, 
occurring  in  approximately  half  of  all  humans,  gastric  cancer  occurs 
in only a small subset of those infected. Higher cancer risk has been 
associated  with  certain  strains  of  H.  pylori;  a  specific  human  genetic 
predisposition  has  not  yet  been  identified.  Supportive  evidence  that 
H. pylori infection is a causative factor in the development of gastric 
cancer  includes  prospective  studies  demonstrating  that  treatment  of  
H.  pylori  infection  decreases  the  overall  risk  of  gastric  cancer.  For 
example, patients with H. pylori infection who had at least one first- 
degree  relative  with  a  history  of  gastric  cancer  (increasing  their  own 
risk  of  stomach  cancer)  were  randomly  assigned  to  placebo  or  treat-
ment for H. pylori. The group receiving H. pylori eradication showed 
a significant decrease in the incidence of gastric cancer (especially for

Gastric Carcinomaa
Exogenous sources of nitrate-converting bacteria:

those  in  whom  H.  pylori  was  successfully  eradicated)  compared  to 
the control group. Earlier studies had demonstrated that treatment of 
H. pylori in Korean patients who had a prior very-early-stage gastric 
cancer decreased the incidence of a second gastric cancer. These data 
suggest  that  treatment  of  asymptomatic  H.  pylori  gastric  infection 
should be considered for patients who have a first-degree relative who 
has  had  gastric  cancer  or  who  themselves  have  a  prior  history  of  an 
early-stage gastric cancer.

In  addition  to  chronic  inflammatory  conditions,  inherited  cancer 
susceptibility  genes  increase  the  risk  of  gastric  cancer.  These  include 
mutations of CDH1, which encodes for the cell cohesion gene e-cadherin; 
germline  CDH1  mutations  markedly  increase  the  risk  for  the  diffuse 
cell (signet cell) gastric cancer subtype (see below for discussion of his-
tologic subtypes). Patients with an inherited deleterious CDH1 muta-
tion  are  considered  for  prophylactic  gastrectomy.  CDH1  mutations 
also increase the risk for lobular breast cancer. Germline mutations in 
the mismatch repair pathway (Lynch syndrome) slightly increase the 
risk  for  gastric  cancer.  Other  inherited  cancer  susceptibility  genetic 
syndromes that increase the risk of gastric cancer include familial ade-
nomatous polyposis, juvenile polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. 
Inherited cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA mutations may not 
significantly  increase  risk  for  gastric  cancer.  Surveillance  programs 
for  the  higher  risk  germline  cancer  susceptibility  genes  should  be 
employed.

Gastric cancer stem cells originating in the bone marrow may play 
an important role in the development of gastric cancer. H. pylori may 
be an inciting factor for recruitment of such bone marrow gastric stem 
cells. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it may have important implica-
tions for therapy of gastric cancers.

Clinical Features 
•  SURVEILLANCE STRATEGIES  As is the case 
for esophageal cancer, the overwhelming majority of Western patients 
with  gastric  cancer  are  symptomatic  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  Early 
detection programs, in Japan and Korea, where gastric cancer has been 
among  the  most  common  of  malignancies  (although  its  incidence 
has  been  decreasing),  include  upper  endoscopy  and,  in  Japan,  upper 
endoscopy  and  serum  pepsinogen;  these  programs  have  increased 
the number of patients found with early gastric cancer and decreased 
mortality  rates.  This  strategy  has  not  been 
cost  effective  in  populations  in  which  the 
incidence  of  gastric  cancer  is  much  lower, 
such  as  in  the  United  States.  In  high-inci-
dence  areas,  treatment  of  symptomatic  H. 
pylori  is  a  preventive  measure.  Exceptions 
to  routine  surveillance  in  the  United  States 
are  asymptomatic  patients  with  CDH1  (and 
other  cancer  susceptibility  gene)  mutations 
who may be part of early detection programs 
and  in  whom  prophylactic  gastrectomy  is  a 
management option.
PRESENTING  SYMPTOMS  Presenting  symp-
toms include vague upper abdominal discom-
fort,  hematemesis  or  melena,  anorexia  and 
early satiety, and unexplained weight loss. For 
patients  with  esophagogastric  junction  can-
cers,  dysphagia  or  odynophagia  may  be  the 
presenting  symptom.  Anemia  may  be  found 
due to occult bleeding. These symptoms and 
signs  lead  to  upper  (and  if  site  of  bleeding 
is  uncertain,  lower)  endoscopy  and  biopsy 
(endoscopy has long replaced barium contrast 
radiography  as  an  initial  diagnostic  step). 
Occasionally, imaging using CT performed to 
evaluate  abdominal  symptoms  may  identify 
gastric  thickening  or  a  gastric  mass  leading 
to  upper  endoscopy.  Physical  examination 
can  reveal  left  supraclavicular  adenopathy 
(Virchow’s node), a periumbilical mass (Sister 

Pylorus

Mary  Joseph  nodule),  a  pelvic  mass  on  rectal  exam  (Blumer’s  shelf), 
ascites,  or  an  ovarian  mass  (Krukenberg  tumor).  More  commonly, 
physical examination is unrevealing.

Upper endoscopy may reveal an ulcer or ulcerated mass, biopsy of 
which shows adenocarcinoma. For the diffuse subtype of gastric can-
cer, a mass or ulceration may not be seen, but rather, thickened gastric 
rugae may be noted. Initial biopsy may not reveal diffuse gastric cancer, 
which may track below the mucosal surface. In these patients, EUS may 
guide biopsy.

Histopathology  Classification  of  Primary  Gastric  
Adenocarcinomas  The  large  majority  (~85%)  of  gastric  malig-
nancies  are  adenocarcinomas  or  subtypes  of  adenocarcinoma.  Other 
malignancies,  discussed  below,  include  neuroendocrine  tumors  (car-
cinoid  tumors),  primary  gastric  lymphomas,  gastrointestinal  stromal 
tumors (GISTs), and other rare malignancies. Using the Lauren clas-
sification,  pathologists  classify  adenocarcinomas  on  the  basis  of  his-
topathology as intestinal (more common) or diffuse subtype (~20%). 
As noted above, the diffuse subtype is associated with inherited CDH1 
mutations; in addition, in the TCGA genomic analysis of gastric can-
cer, approximately a third of diffuse subtype cases had somatic CDH1 
mutations. The intestinal subtype is associated with H. pylori infection 
and atopic gastritis. Histologic grade also influences the clinical course.
Genomic  analysis  performed  by  several  groups  has  resulted  in 
molecular  classifications  of  gastric  cancer  that  may,  in  the  future, 
inform staging systems, provide a better understanding of the driving 
factors  in  the  development  of  gastric  cancer,  and  provide  important 
information on treatment options (Fig. 80-2). For example, the TCGA 
group reported the results of a multiplatform analysis of 295 patients 
with  previously  untreated  gastric  cancer;  both  Western  and  Asian 
patients were included in the analysis. Four subtypes of gastric cancer 
were identified: high Epstein-Barr virus burden, microsatellite unstable 
with  hypermutation,  genomically  stable  (associated  with  the  diffuse 
subtype),  and  chromosomal  unstable.  The  Asian  Cancer  Research 
Group (ACRG), studying primary tumors from 300 Korean patients, 
analyzed gene expression profiles and found four subtypes: mesenchy-
mal, microsatellite unstable, microsatellite stable with TP53 expressed, 
and microsatellite unstable with TP53 mutated. Clinical outcome was 
correlated  with  genomic  subtype  in  both  studies,  with  microsatellite

(TCGA) and mesenchymal (ACRG) types the worst.

In  addition  to  histopathology,  molecular  diagnostics  (including 
NGS) are an important part of the pathology workup. The molecular 
subtypes  have  therapeutic  implications;  for  example,  ~20%  of  gastric 
cancer  or  gastroesophageal  junction  cancer  patients’  tumors  have 
overexpression  or  amplification  of  HER2,  which  would  lead  to  the 
addition of agents such as trastuzumab as part of systemic treatment 
for  metastatic  disease.  Immune  modulation  therapy  may  be  used  in 
patients with hypermutated tumors, found by NGS or by polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) for microsatellite instability (MSI). An evaluation 
for overexpression or amplification of HER2, quantification of PD-L1 
by immunohistochemistry, and assessment of MSI by PCR or deficient 
mismatch  repair  protein  (dMMRP)  expression  should  be  a  routine 
part of the pathology workup of patients with metastatic gastric cancer. 

More  controversial  is  whether  these  assays  should  also  be  routinely 
performed in patients with potentially operable gastric cancer because 
the  addition  of  trastuzumab  to  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  has  not 
yet been shown to change outcome. In large-volume centers, NGS is 
routinely performed on pretreatment biopsies. Currently, the finding 
on pathologic assays of positive tumor Epstein-Barr virus (identified in 
8–10% of gastric cancer patients) does not change therapeutic options.

Staging  Once  a  diagnosis  of  a  primary  gastric  adenocarcinoma 
is  made,  algorithms  for  clinical  evaluation  of  stage  include  physical 
examination  and  imaging  studies  (Fig.  80-3;  Table  80-5).  Tumor- 
related biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CA19-9 
may be elevated but are nonspecific (may be elevated in a number of 
other  gastrointestinal  and  other  site  cancers).  Diagnostic  CT  scan  of 
the  chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvis  should  be  performed.  If  metastatic

disease  is  suspected  on  imaging,  a  biopsy  of  a  metastatic  site  should 
be strongly considered to confirm stage IV disease, which changes the 
goals of care from potentially curative to palliative treatment. As is the 
case for esophageal cancer, FDG-PET/CT, which is more sensitive than 
diagnostic CT scan in identifying sites of metastatic disease, should be 
performed if the anatomic CT is negative for metastatic disease. Note, 
however, that FDG-PET may be noninformative (the primary tumor 
may  not  be  FDG-avid,  particularly  in  diffuse-type  gastric  cancer).  If 
imaging  does  not  reveal  metastatic  disease,  EUS  should  be  strongly 
considered  to  determine  depth  of  penetration  of  the  primary  tumor 
and the presence or absence of regional lymphadenopathy suspicious 
for  metastasis.  Lymph  node  biopsy  and,  on  occasion,  biopsy  of  left 
hepatic  parenchymal  lesions  found  on  EUS  can  be  performed  at  the 
same setting. Endoscopic biopsies usually provide enough tumor tis-
sue for molecular diagnostic pathology testing for HER2, MSI/MMRP, 
and PD-L1 assessment; it may not provide enough tissue for genomic 
alteration  analysis.  If  neoadjuvant  therapy  is  planned,  laparoscopy 
should be considered to allow evaluation of the peritoneal cavity, with 
peritoneal washing for cytology if no peritoneal metastases are visible. 
The peritoneal cavity is a common site of metastases, especially from 
diffuse-type  gastric  cancer.  The  finding  of  peritoneal  involvement 
either visibly or by positive cytology is staged as metastatic disease and 
diminishes the chance for curative resection.

The staging classification for gastric cancer is summarized in Table 
80-5. Three staging classifications are provided: cTNM clinical staging 
(before  any  therapy  has  been  given),  pTNM  pathologic  staging  (for 
patients not undergoing preoperative therapy), and a post-neoadjuvant 
therapy  classification  staging  (ypTNM).  The  three  components  take 

into account current standard of care options for therapy in which the 
AJCC prognostic stage groups from clinical staging guide therapeutic 
decisions. For example, after clinical evaluation, a large percentage of 
newly diagnosed patients will be found to have higher-stage primary 
cancers  (penetrating  through  the  gastric  wall  [T3  or  T4]  or  lymph 
node–positive tumors), in which case perioperative (neoadjuvant) sys-
temic therapy may be chosen. Pathologic examination of the resected 
specimen  for  prognostic  stage  classification  must  take  into  account 
exposure to preoperative therapies that may lead to downstaging (thus, 
ypTNM staging). Nomograms have been developed for predicting out-
come in patients undergoing surgery as initial treatment.

TREATMENT
Gastric Cancer 

POTENTIALLY CURABLE GASTRIC CANCER: SURGERY
Surgical removal of the primary tumor with negative microscopic 
margins  (an  R0  resection)  and  with  resection  of  regional  lymph 
nodes  is  currently  the  only  curative  therapy;  with  surgery  alone, 
5-year  survival  rates  are  approximately  25%.  If  tumor  cells  are 
found at the margin of resection (R1) or if visible cancer is left at 
the time of surgical removal of the primary tumor (R2), surgery is 
palliative rather than curative. For patients with early-stage tumors 
(mostly  clinical  stage  I),  surgery  without  perioperative  systemic 
therapy may be performed. For patients with more locally advanced 
tumors  (clinical  stages  IIA,  IIB,  III),  who  compose  approximately 
70% of newly diagnosed operable patients, multimodality therapy 
(surgery  and  systemic  chemotherapy)  improves  overall  survival. 
Both neoadjuvant (preoperative) and postoperative systemic ther-
apy are accepted approaches. If staging studies demonstrate a locally 
advanced  cancer  (T3/4  or  node  positive),  preoperative  treatment 
is recommended in a medically fit patient. If surgery is performed 
first and a locally advanced cancer is found, postoperative chemo-
therapy  or  chemotherapy  plus  chemoradiation  is  recommended. 
For selected very-early-stage gastric cancers (primary tumors that 
are  ≤2  cm  in  diameter,  are  well  to  moderately  differentiated,  do 
not invade the deep submucosa, and do not show lymphovascular 
invasion  or  lymph  node  metastasis),  which  are  not  commonly 
found  in  the  United  States,  endoscopic  mucosal  resection  (EMR) 
or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) may be performed by 
experienced gastroenterologists in place of surgical resection, with 
favorable results in studies in high-incidence areas such as Japan.

For patients in whom the primary tumor is in the distal stom-
ach,  a  subtotal  gastrectomy  is  the  preferred  surgical  procedure. 
For  tumors  of  the  proximal  stomach,  the  options  for  resection 
include  total  gastrectomy  or,  alternatively,  proximal  gastrectomy. 
Esophagogastrectomy  is  performed  for  tumors  involving  the  gas-
troesophageal junction. In selected patients, a jejunostomy feeding 
tube may be placed if postoperative radiation therapy is part of the 
treatment plan.

As  noted  above,  laparoscopy  is  commonly  performed  at  high- 
volume centers before a final decision regarding the role of surgery. 
If  staging  has  already  demonstrated  clinically  suspicious  lymph 
nodes  or  an  advanced  T  stage  tumor,  but  laparoscopy  does  not 
demonstrate  peritoneal  metastasis,  perioperative  chemotherapy  is 
given before surgical resection.

Palliative  resection  of  the  primary  tumor  is  usually  performed 
only if symptoms such as uncontrollable bleeding or obstruction are 
present that cannot be relieved by other means.

As is the case for colorectal cancer, a correlation exists between 
the  number  of  lymph  nodes  removed  and  sampled  and  outcome. 
Sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  is  not  performed  in  gastric  cancer 
outside of a research study setting. The goal is to examine at least 
15  lymph  nodes  from  the  resected  specimen;  it  is  more  contro-
versial whether more extensive lymph node resection itself affects 
outcome;  the  extent  of  lymphadenopathy  can  be  classified  using 
a  D0–D3  system  with  a  higher  number  meaning  more  extensive 
lymphadenopathy.  In  the  United  States,  a  modified  D2  (D1+)

resection  preserving  the  spleen  and  avoiding  pancreatectomy  is 
recommended  but  should  be  performed  by  experienced  surgeons 
at  high-volume  centers.  Japanese  investigators  and  others  have 
used  very  extensive  lymph  node  dissections,  but  studies  have  not 
demonstrated  an  advantage  for  a  D3  resection.  Both  resection  of 
the primary tumor and its regional lymph nodes can be performed 
laparoscopically in appropriate patients.

In the hands of experienced surgeons, operative mortality would 

be anticipated to be ≤2%. 

NEOADJUVANT AND POSTOPERATIVE ADJUVANT 
THERAPY FOR RESECTABLE GASTRIC CANCER
The  large  majority  of  potentially  resectable  Western  gastric  can-
cer  patients  have  locally  advanced  tumors  (cTNM  stage  IIA/B  or 
III). Multimodality therapy using systemic chemotherapy improves 
5-year  survival  rates  by  10–15%  compared  to  surgery  alone.  A 
widely  cited  study,  the  MAGIC  clinical  trial,  randomly  assigned 
patients with potentially resectable disease to receive perioperative 
chemotherapy  or  to  proceed  directly  to  surgery.  Five-year  overall 
survival for patients undergoing surgery alone was 23%; for those 
receiving  pre-  and  postoperative  chemotherapy,  it  was  36%.  On 
the  basis  of  this  and  other  clinical  trials,  for  most  medically  fit 
patients  with  stage  cTNM  II  and  III  resectable  gastric  cancers, 
preoperative  systemic  chemotherapy  followed  by  resection  and,  if 
tolerable,  postoperative  chemotherapy  is  a  standard  of  care.  Che-
moradiation  as  given  for  esophageal  cancers  is  usually  used  for 
gastroesophageal junction tumors. Preoperative chemoradiation or 
preoperative chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation for gastric 
cancer,  as  opposed  to  esophageal  or  gastroesophageal  junction 
cancers,  has  been  studied  but  is  still  an  investigational  approach. 
For patients being treated with multimodality therapy, close inter-
actions  among  the  surgeon,  medical  oncologist,  and  radiation 
oncologist are essential.

Clinical trials have compared different cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens,  most  of  which  include  a  platinum  compound—either 
cisplatin or oxaliplatin. Currently, a platinum compound plus a flu-
orinated pyrimidine, such as fluorouracil or capecitabine, given for 
three to four cycles before surgery is a standard of care option. Drug 
combinations  are  favored;  an  example  is  the  FOLFOX  regimen, 
which  includes  fluorouracil,  leucovorin,  and  oxaliplatin.  For  very 
fit patients, a combination of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel 
(FLOT) may be chosen. Addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy 
has not improved outcomes for patients with HER2-positive can-
cers.  Careful  monitoring  of  chemotherapy-related  toxicities  with 
appropriate dose modifications is important. Several clinical trials 
have included both preoperative and postoperative systemic ther-
apy; a substantial number of patients will have a slow postoperative 
recovery and not receive postoperative treatment. Maximizing the 
ability to give preoperative chemotherapy is an important consid-
eration. For patients receiving preoperative systemic chemotherapy 
and  undergoing  a  D2/D1+  dissection,  postoperative  chemoradia-
tion therapy has not improved outcome.

For patients in whom the primary tumor has been resected and 
who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy, who are found to 
have stage II or III cancers, or who have <15 lymph nodes found in 
the resected specimen, postoperative chemoradiation is a treatment 
option. Chemoradiation therapy may also be given for unresectable 
cancers in selected patients. 

PALLIATIVE THERAPY FOR INCURABLE GASTRIC CANCER
Patients  with  clinical  stage  IV  gastric  cancers  with  an  adequate 
performance  status  should  be  offered  systemic  drug  therapies. 
Small  clinical  trials  performed  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  showed  a 
survival benefit for systemic therapy compared to best supportive 
care  only.  The  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  regimens  most  commonly 
employed  are  still  based  on  a  platinum  compound  and  a  fluori-
nated  pyrimidine  (e.g.,  FOLFOX,  as  is  used  in  the  perioperative 
setting).  However,  two  subgroups  of  gastric  cancer  patients  have 
been  identified  who  benefit  from  the  addition  of  noncytotoxic

agents. Those whose tumors have overexpressed or amplified HER2 
should  receive  HER2-targeted  agents  such  as  trastuzumab  plus 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy  because  a  modest  survival  advantage  has 
been demonstrated. Additional HER2-targeted therapy using tras-
tuzumab-deruxtecan,  a  monoclonal  antibody-drug  conjugate,  has 
encouraging  activity  in  patients  whose  tumors  were  refractory 
to  trastuzumab.  For  patients  with  MSI/dMMRP  gastric  cancers, 
PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab should be used (currently 
approved in the second-line setting). Immune modulation therapy 
using  PD-1  inhibitors  such  as  pembrolizumab  or  nivolumab  is 
also approved in gastric cancer with tumor specimens having ≥1% 
PD-L1  expression,  with  modest  response  rates.  The  development 
of  more  effective  immune  therapies  and  their  combination  with 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy  (and  in  combination  with  trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy in HER2-positive patients) as initial treatment 
are areas of active investigation.

When disease progresses after first-line treatment, other thera-
pies  include  the  combination  of  a  VEGF  receptor–targeted  agent, 
ramucirumab,  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  paclitaxel.  As 
noted  above,  immune  modulation  therapy  may  cause  remissions 
in patients whose tumors have at least 1% PD-L1 expression. PD-1 
inhibitors  are  the  preferred  option  for  patients  whose  tumors  are 
microsatellite  unstable.  Several  other  cytotoxic  agents  have  activ-
ity  in  the  palliative  setting  including  irinotecan  and  trifluridine- 
tipiracil. Best results from clinical trials indicate overall survival for 
treated patients with stage IV disease is still only 12–15 months.

Radiation  therapy  using  shorter  regimens  may  be  employed  to 
palliate  bleeding.  For  patients  with  advanced  incurable  disease, 
other supportive measures include placement of a duodenal stent to 
relieve gastric outlet obstruction; in selected patients, surgical pro-
cedures for gastric outlet obstruction may be performed. Radiation 
therapy might be used if not previously given. Enteral feeding using 
a jejunostomy tube may support nutritional needs.

GASTRIC LYMPHOMAS
Lymphomas  of  the  stomach  are  an  uncommon  (~3%)  but  important 
subgroup of gastric malignancies. They are extranodal non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas (NHL). The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site 
for extranodal NHL, and the stomach is the most common site within 
the gastrointestinal tract. The presenting symptoms are similar to those 
of the much more common adenocarcinoma of the stomach described 
above, including pain, anorexia, and bleeding. Symptoms of fever and 
night sweats occur in 10–15% of patients with gastric NHL. Because 
the  treatment  options  are  so  different,  obtaining  adequate  tissue  for 
definitive  pathologic  examination  is  crucial  in  diagnosing  gastric 
lymphomas.  On  occasion,  this  may  be  challenging  because,  similar 
to diffuse subtype adenocarcinoma, lymphomas may track below the 
mucosal surface. Multiple deep biopsies and mucosal resection may be 
needed to provide enough tissue for definitive pathologic assessment.

Potential  driving  forces  in  the  development  of  gastric  lymphomas 
include  active  or  prior  H.  pylori  infection,  which  is  associated  with 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) subtype gastric lympho-
mas.  MALT  lymphomas  may  develop  in  nearly  any  organ,  but  the 
stomach is the most frequent primary site, accounting for ~35% of all 
MALT  lymphomas.  Antibacterial  therapy  directed  against  H.  pylori 
can  be  a  highly  effective  treatment  in  these  patients.  Other  forms  of 
NHL may involve the stomach either as primary gastric lymphoma or 
as a secondary site of disease, including both B-cell (e.g., mantle cell 
lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma) and T-cell 
lymphomas (e.g., enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic 
large-cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma).

Staging is performed in a fashion similar to gastric adenocarcinoma, 
but the staging classification is different (see below). In addition to a 
contrast-enhanced diagnostic-quality CT scan of the chest, abdomen, 
and  pelvis,  an  FDG-PET/CT  scan  may  be  helpful.  EUS  may  be  used 
to  determine  depth  of  invasion  in  patients  in  whom  no  evidence  of 
metastatic disease is noted. Examination of the peripheral blood and 
bone  marrow  aspirate  should  be  considered  as  part  of  the  workup.  

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   633

In all patients with gastric lymphoma, H. pylori infection status should 
be evaluated. If H. pylori testing is negative by histopathology, nonin-
vasive testing by either stool antigen test or urea breath test should be 
used. If rituximab will be part of the treatment plan (see below), hepa-
titis B testing should be performed.

 ■ STAGING
The TNM staging system is not employed for gastric lymphomas. The 
Lugano staging system for gastrointestinal lymphomas (a modification 
of the Ann Arbor staging system) divides patient groups into stages I, 
II, and IV. Stage I tumors are limited to the gastric wall; stage II tumors 
have regional lymph node involvement or invasion of local structures; 
stage IV tumors have either more extensive lymph node involvement 
or  have  distant  metastasis,  including  to  the  bone  marrow  or  other 
extranodal sites.

 ■ PATHOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION
The two most common histologic subtypes of gastric lymphoma are mar-
ginal zone B-cell lymphomas (gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphomas or 
MALT; ~40% of newly diagnosed patients) and diffuse large B-cell lym-
phomas (DLBCLs; ~55%). The distinction is critical because therapeutic 
options are different. As part  of the pathologic evaluation, for patients 
with  H.  pylori–positive  gastric  lymphomas,  the  finding  of  a  t(11;18) 
translocation  identifies  a  subgroup  less  likely  to  respond  to  H.  pylori 
eradication. This translocation may be detected using PCR or fluorescent 
in situ hybridization (FISH); it creates a chimeric protein composed of 
the amino terminal of API1 (apoptosis inhibitor) and the carboxy termi-
nus of MALT1, leading to activation of nuclear factor-κB signaling.

TREATMENT
Gastric Lymphoma

Unlike adenocarcinoma of the stomach, surgical resection has no 
role in the treatment of primary gastric lymphoma in the absence 
of  complications  of  therapy  such  as  perforation  or  uncontrolla-
ble  bleeding.  Resection  of  gastric  lymphoma  does  not  improve 
outcome.

For patients with MALT lymphoma, eradication of H. pylori with 
antibiotics is highly effective therapy. If tests for H. pylori are posi-
tive and t(11;18) translocation assay is negative, one of the currently 
accepted  antibiotic  regimens  for  treating  H.  pylori  should  be  the 
initial therapy. H. pylori eradication is associated with high response 
rates including complete remissions in the majority of patients. The 
time  to  remission  may  be  prolonged  (in  some  studies  averaging 
15–16  months);  therefore,  careful  monitoring  is  important  before 
determining that a MALT tumor is not responding to anti–H. pylori 
therapy.  For  patients  in  whom  the  t(11;18)  translocation  assay  is 
positive, options for therapy include anti–H. pylori antibiotic ther-
apy plus involved-field radiation therapy or, if radiation is contrain-
dicated, the use of single-agent rituximab, a monoclonal antibody 
targeting CD20. For patients who are H. pylori negative, moderate-
dose (24–30 Gy) involved-site radiation therapy or single-agent rit-
uximab is a treatment option. For selected, more advanced, stage IV 
MALT patients who have not responded to or who have progressed 
after  receiving  anti–H.  pylori  antibiotic  therapy  and/or  rituximab, 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy  regimens  such  as  R-CHOP  (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) or 
rituximab and lenalidomide may be considered.

DLBCL  may  be  a  result  of  transformation  from  more  indolent 
MALT lymphoma or may arise de novo. De novo tumors are more 
likely to be BCL2 and CD10 positive. MALT lymphomas that have 
transformed  to  DLBCLs  are  more  frequently  BCL2  and  CD10 
negative.

For patients with DLBCL, earlier stage tumors may be treated by 
combination chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus involved-
field radiation therapy. For more advanced gastric DLBCL tumors, 
chemotherapy using R-CHOP or R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, 
prednisolone,  vincristine,  cyclophosphamide,  and  doxorubicin) 

regimens  is  standard  of  care.  Some  reports  have  suggested  that 
eradication of H. pylori is effective treatment for early-stage DLBCL 
when the patient also has H. pylori.

UNCOMMON TUMORS OF THE ESOPHAGUS 
AND STOMACH
 ■ NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the esophagus are rare, accounting 
for  <1%  of  gastrointestinal  NETs.  They  may  present  with  dysphagia 
and  odynophagia  similar  to  that  of  more  common  squamous  cell  or 
adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction 
or with more nonspecific symptoms such as substernal discomfort or 
burning consistent with reflux esophagitis. A potential driving factor 
of  higher  grade  NET  is  smoking.  The  initial  diagnostic  evaluation 
includes  upper  endoscopy  and  biopsy.  Pathology  may  reveal  a  well- 
differentiated grade 1 or grade 2 NET with a low metastatic potential; 
at  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum  are  small-cell  or  large-cell  NETs, 
which  are  fully  malignant  and  frequently  metastasize.  EUS  to  assess 
depth of penetration and presence or absence of regional lymph node 
metastasis is usually performed. Imaging studies include CT or FDG-
PET/CT  scan  to  assess  for  metastatic  disease,  particularly  in  higher 
grade  tumors.  For  lower  grade  tumors,  somatostatin  analog  imaging 
studies such as gallium-68 DOTATATE may be performed if metastatic 
disease  is  suspected.  For  lower  grade  tumors,  endoscopic  resection 
including  EMR  or  ESD  may  be  performed.  Small-cell  or  large-cell 
NETs  that  are  not  metastatic  are  usually  treated  with  chemotherapy 
plus  external-beam  radiation  therapy  using  chemotherapy  regimens 
similar  to  those  employed  for  small-  and  large-cell  neuroendocrine 
cancers of the lung (Chap. 84). Systemic therapy for metastatic small- 
and  large-cell  esophagogastric  NETs  is  also  modeled  on  therapy  for 
small- and large-cell thoracic NETs.

Gastric NETs (also called gastric carcinoid tumors) represent 7–9% 
of  gastrointestinal  NETs  but  <1%  of  gastric  neoplasms.  They  are 
divided into three types (Chap. 84). For all gastric NETs, initial eval-
uation includes upper endoscopy and biopsy. EUS may be helpful in 
assessing depth of invasion for larger tumors and for assessing regional 
lymph node metastases in type 3 tumors. Somatostatin analog imaging 
using gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT scanning may be performed if 
metastatic disease is suspected. The finding of unresectable metastatic 
disease that is gallium-68 DOTATATE avid not only provides staging 
information  but  also  guides  potential  therapy  using  somatostatin 
receptor–targeted therapy.

TREATMENT
Gastric Neuroendocrine Tumors

Type 1 tumors are usually treated endoscopically with polypectomy 
or  endomucosal  resection.  For  larger  tumors  (>2  cm)  or  tumors 
invading through the muscularis or to regional lymph nodes, surgi-
cal resection is recommended. Type 2 tumors have a higher risk for 
regional lymph node metastasis and are usually treated surgically, 
although selected patients may have a combination of endoscopic 
resection and limited surgical resection. Type 3 tumors are not asso-
ciated with elevated gastrin levels and have a higher propensity for 
regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Surgery is 
the treatment of choice for localized type 3 tumors, although EMR 
has been used in selected patients. Adenocarcinoma of the stomach 
may be found in 5–10% of type 3 tumors.

 ■ GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS
Gastrointestinal  stromal  tumors  (GISTs)  are  rare  tumors  of  the  gas-
trointestinal tract associated with somatic mutations in the cKIT (the 
majority)  or  PDGFRA  genes,  which  are  both  driver  mutations  and 
targets  for  systemic  therapy  for  metastatic  disease;  in  a  minority  of 
cases,  neither  gene  is  mutated.  GISTs  arise  from  Cajal  cells,  which 
bridge between the autonomic nerves to the muscle layer of the bowel. 
The  stomach  is  the  most  frequent  primary  site  (~50%),  followed  by

the small bowel in about a third of cases. As endoscopy for other indi-
cations  has  become  more  widely  used,  otherwise  asymptomatic  and 
probably clinically insignificant small GISTs have been identified more 
frequently;  it  is  not  clear  that  the  actual  incidence  has  substantially 
increased. Symptoms associated with GISTs include acute gastrointes-
tinal bleeding leading to melena and/or hematemesis. Anemia may be 
reflected in generalized weakness. With larger tumors, abdominal dis-
tention and pain may be presenting symptoms. At endoscopy, a non-
specific smooth bulging mass covered by normal mucosa is the most 
frequent finding. Initial biopsy may not reveal an epithelial neoplasm. 
EUS both to assess the extent of the neoplasm and to guide biopsy in 
order to obtain adequate tissue for histology and molecular pathology 
may be helpful.

Histologically, a spindle cell neoplasm is the most common subtype 
(~70%), with epithelioid cells making up 20%; 10% of cases are mixed 
histology.  Immunohistochemical  stains  for  the  presence  of  c-kit  or 
CD34 positivity and mutational analysis of cKIT and PDGFRA should 
be performed in all patients. These help to distinguish between GISTs 
and leiomyoma neoplasms. For nonmetastatic primary GISTs, laparo-
scopic surgical resection, if feasible, is the treatment of choice; because 
lymph node metastases are unusual, wedge or segmental resection is 
preferred. Endoscopic resection has been used in selected cases. Nei-
ther histology nor the presence of a cKIT or  PDGFRA mutation dis-
tinguishes GISTs with clinically malignant phenotype from those that 
have a benign course. Higher risk tumors (larger size, higher mitotic 
index) may present with or develop metastatic or locally unresectable 
disease. For these patients, use of a c-kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor such 
as imatinib for tumors with cKIT mutations offers effective palliation. 
Avapritinib  is  used  for  tumors  with  certain  PDGFRA  mutations. 
However, resistance almost invariably develops, and the development 
of  newer  agents  effective  in  tumors  with  secondary  mutations  is  a 
high priority. For high-risk GISTs, adjuvant therapy with imatinib for  
3 years improves relapse-free and overall survival.

 ■ SMALL-BOWEL NEOPLASMS
Although the number of new cases of small-bowel neoplasms is sub-
stantially  less  than  that  of  gastric  neoplasms  (in  2020,  there  were  an 
estimated 11,110 new cases in the United States, representing 3–4% of 
gastrointestinal  malignancies),  the  spectrum  of  malignant  tumors  of 
the small bowel is similar and includes NETs (carcinoid), adenocarci-
nomas,  lymphomas,  and  GISTs.  Neuroendocrine  cancers  are  slightly 
more  frequent  (40–45%)  than  adenocarcinomas  (30–40%),  with  the 
remainder  mostly  lymphomas  and  ~8%  GISTs.  The  duodenum  is 
the most common portion of the small bowel in which malignancies 
develop (~50%), with ~30% occurring in the jejunum and 20% in the 
ileum. NETs are the most common benign and malignant tumors of 
the ileum. Risk factors for the development of adenocarcinoma include 
inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease) and inherited germline 
mutation  syndromes  such  as  Lynch  syndrome,  familial  adenomatous 
polyposis (FAP), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Celiac disease is asso-
ciated with a higher incidence of both small-bowel adenocarcinomas 
and T-cell lymphomas.

While  an  asymptomatic  small-bowel  primary  adenocarcinoma 
might  be  found  during  surveillance  in  patients  at  high  risk  (such  as 
someone with FAP), symptoms due to obstruction or bleeding (which 
may  be  occult)  lead  to  the  diagnosis  of  a  small-bowel  tumor  in  a 
substantial  number  of  patients.  Both  adenocarcinoma  and  lympho-
mas  might  present  with  perforation.  The  development  of  anemia  or 
obstructive symptoms in a patient with a germline cancer susceptibility 
gene mutation should lead to a high degree of suspicion for develop-
ing  malignancy.  Evaluation  by  diagnostic  CT  imaging  may  reveal  an 
obstructing lesion. CT and/or MRI enterography can be helpful if the 
diagnostic  CT  is  not  informative.  Endoscopy  using  techniques  such 
as  double  balloon  enteroscopy  or  video  capsule  endoscopy  allows 
(for the former) tissue diagnosis as well as localization. Video capsule 
endoscopy is contraindicated in the setting of obstruction. For NETs, 
a gallium-68 DOTATATE scan may identify both the primary site as 
well  as  metastatic  disease.  Blood  tumor  biomarkers  are  nonspecific 
for  the  primary  site  (CEA  or  CA19-9  for  adenocarcinoma  or  serum 

chromogranin  for  NET);  these  assays  are  better  used  to  monitor 
response or progression of disease rather than for diagnosis.

Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel appears to be increasing in inci-
dence. The median age for sporadic small-bowel tumors is in the sev-
enth or eighth decade of life, but genetically predisposed patients and 
those with inflammatory bowel disease may be diagnosed at a much 
earlier age. African Americans have a higher incidence of small-bowel 
cancer than whites. While systemic therapies are usually modeled on 
agents used to treat colorectal cancer, genomic analyses have indicated 
that  small-bowel  adenocarcinoma  has  distinct  genomic  alterations 
compared to either colorectal or gastric cancers. Genomic alterations 
less frequent in small-bowel than in colorectal cancers include TP53, 
BRAF  V600E,  and  APC  mutations,  whereas  the  rate  of  KRAS  muta-
tions is similar to colorectal cancer. Within small-bowel sites, the most 
striking  difference  is  the  higher  rate  of  ERBB2  alterations  (of  which 
a  minority  are  amplifications)  in  duodenal  cancers.  Not  surprisingly, 
because Lynch syndrome increases the risk of small-bowel adenocarci-
noma, 15–20% of these tumors are MSI high or mismatch repair defi-
cient; small-bowel adenocarcinoma associated with celiac disease also 
may  have  an  increased  rate  of  MSI-high  tumors.  MSI/MMRP  status 
should  be  assessed  in  all  patients  with  small-bowel  adenocarcinoma. 
Somatic tumor genomic analysis may suggest a germline mutation, but 
appropriate  genetic  testing  for  a  germline  driver  mutation  should  be 
performed in all patients with small-bowel adenocarcinoma.

Small-bowel  adenocarcinoma  has  its  own  staging  classification  in 

the AJCC eighth edition.

TREATMENT
Small-Bowel Adenocarcinomas

Surgical  resection  with  negative  microscopic  margins  (R0),  as  is 
the  case  for  other  gastrointestinal  tumors,  is  the  best  chance  for 
cure.  For  duodenal  adenocarcinomas,  a  Whipple  procedure  may 
be needed; for more distal duodenal cancers and jejunal adenocar-
cinomas,  a  segmental  resection  with  adequate  margins  should  be 
performed. Distal ileal tumors may require right hemicolectomy.

Small-bowel cancers are frequently found with locally advanced 
disease at the time of diagnosis. If the tumor is resectable, postop-
erative  adjuvant  systemic  therapy  is  currently  recommended  for 
lymph node–positive patients, using regimens such as capecitabine- 
oxaliplatin. Benefit from adjuvant therapy has not yet been proven. 
Small-bowel cancers developing in patients with Lynch syndrome 
probably  have  a  better  prognosis;  if  colorectal  cancer  is  a  model, 
postoperative  adjuvant  therapy  for  patients  with  Lynch  syndrome 
should be combination chemotherapy, not single-agent fluorinated 
pyrimidines. The value of immune modulation therapy is not estab-
lished.  For  duodenal  cancers,  chemoradiation  is  considered  if  the 
resection margins are still positive.

For  patients  with  advanced  metastatic  disease,  in  the  absence 
of  Lynch  syndrome  or  a  hypermutated  tumor,  similar  cytotoxic 
regimens as deployed for gastric or colon cancers have been widely 
used. For tumors that are MSI high or dMMPR, immunotherapy is 
indicated;  for  tumors  that  are  HER2  amplified  or  BRAF  mutated, 
targeted therapy may be useful.

 ■ SMALL-BOWEL GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL 
TUMORS
Like  small-bowel  adenocarcinomas,  small-bowel  GISTs  may  pres-
ent  with  obstruction  or  bleeding.  Diagnostic  techniques  are  those 
employed  for  other  small-bowel  neoplasms.  While  the  pathological 
criteria for malignant potential are somewhat different than those used 
for gastric GISTs, postoperative management and treatment of meta-
static disease are the same as those described above for gastric GIST.
 ■ CARCINOID (NEUROENDOCRINE) TUMORS OF 
THE SMALL BOWEL
Carcinoid tumors are the most common small-bowel neoplasms. For 
not  yet  identified  reasons,  the  incidence  of  small-bowel  carcinoid

tumors has markedly increased over the past several decades. Although 
known risk factors include inherited genetic cancer susceptibility genes 
such as MEN1 and neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), these are unlikely to be 
the cause of the increase (Chap. 84). However, although the incidence 
has increased, small-bowel carcinoids are still uncommon, with an esti-
mated incidence of approximately nine cases per million in the United 
States; the disease is more common in African Americans than whites.
Anatomically, the ileum is the most common part of the small bowel 
affected (~49%), followed by the duodenum and the jejunum. As is the 
case for gastric carcinoid tumors, grade is based on mitotic rate and/or 
Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Histologic differentiation also uses the 
same criteria as in gastric carcinoid tumors.

In the absence of metastatic disease to the liver in the subgroup of 
patients whose tumors are functional (i.e., produce a hormone, usually 
serotonin;  a  duodenal  NET  may  be  a  gastrinoma),  presenting  symp-
toms may be vague abdominal discomfort until or unless small-bowel 
obstruction  occurs.  Carcinoid  syndrome  may  be  found  in  patients 
whose tumors are diagnosed with already established hepatic metasta-
sis. Because the liver is very efficient at clearing serotonin on first pass, 
carcinoid syndrome as a result of small-bowel carcinoid tumors usually 
does not occur in the absence of hepatic metastasis.

Clinical evaluation includes a diagnostic-quality CT or MRI of the 
abdomen and pelvis. For duodenal carcinoid tumors, upper endoscopy 
with EUS is also performed, and for jejunal or ileal carcinoid tumors, 
colonoscopy  is  performed.  Small-bowel  imaging  may  be  performed 
by  CT  enterography;  if  an  obstructing  tumor  is  suspected,  capsule 
endoscopy  should  be  avoided.  The  diagnosis  of  a  metastatic  NET 
may be suspected from the radiographic appearance on CT imaging. 
Somatostatin analog imaging using gallium-68 DOTATATE is helpful 
in assessing extent of disease in patients whose tumors are somatostatin 
analog  avid,  as  well  as  in  identifying  patients  who  may  benefit  from 
therapy targeting the somatostatin receptor. The AJCC eighth edition 
cancer  staging  manual  has  a  specific  small-bowel  NET  TNM  stage 
classification.

The  majority  of  patients  present  with  locoregional  disease,  with 
approximately  40%  having  identified  lymph  node  metastasis.  Ten  to 
15% of patients have metastatic disease (usually to the liver) at the time 
of initial diagnosis.

Initial  management  should  be  surgical  resection  with  curative 
intent;  for  patients  with  extensive  adenopathy  involving  the  root  of 
the mesentery, vascular reconstruction may be required. Since small-
bowel  NETs  may  involve  multiple  tumors  (15–30%  of  patients),  the 
entire  small  bowel  should  be  carefully  examined.  For  patients  with 
functional carcinoid tumors, somatostatin analog therapy using agents 
such as octreotide should be given before the induction of anesthesia to 
avoid a carcinoid crisis. For patients with hepatic metastasis, resection 
or regional therapy including ablation or hepatic artery embolization 
for functional tumors may provide effective palliation. Carcinoid syn-
drome may also be palliated by somatostatin receptor targeted therapy 
in the patients in whom gallium-68 DOTATATE scanning is positive 
(the  majority  of  patients  with  carcinoid  syndrome),  including  agents 
such as octreotide or lanreotide, or by peptide-directed radiation ther-
apy  using  lutetium-177.  Everolimus,  an  mTOR  kinase  inhibitor,  has 
modest activity in metastatic small-bowel carcinoid tumors.

 ■ BENIGN NEOPLASMS OF THE SMALL BOWEL
As is the case for malignant small-bowel tumors, benign neoplasms of 
the small bowel are rare. In addition to cancers, the precursor lesion 
adenomas or hamartomas (from which cancers develop) may be driven 
by inherited cancer susceptibility genes (FAP, Lynch syndrome, Peutz-
Jeghers  syndrome,  among  others.).  Other  benign  neoplasms  include 
lipomas,  leiomyomas,  neurofibromas,  and  benign  lymphoid  nodular 
hyperplasia.

Patients  with  benign  small-bowel  neoplasms  not  associated  with 
an inherited cancer susceptibility gene (in which case a benign tumor 
may be found during surveillance) are usually asymptomatic. A mass 
may be noted on an imaging study (usually a CT) ordered for another 
reason. Workup for occult or overt bleeding or intussusception of the 
bowel may lead to the discovery of a benign small-bowel neoplasm.

Diagnostic  evaluation  may  include  video  capsule  endoscopy  and 
double balloon or push enteroscopy. In general, benign neoplasms, if 
found  during  surveillance,  are  removed  endoscopically,  if  technically 
feasible, to decrease the risk of intussusception in Peutz-Jeghers syn-
drome. Mucosectomy may be used to treat bleeding hemangiomas.

COLORECTAL CANCER
 ■ INCIDENCE
Cancer of the large bowel is second only to lung cancer as a cause of 
cancer death in the United States: 149,500 new cases were identified in 
2021, and 52,980 deaths were due to colorectal cancer. The incidence 
rate has decreased significantly during the past 30 years in individu-
als 50 years of age or older, likely due in large part to enhanced and 
more  compliantly  followed  screening  practices.  Similarly,  mortality 
rates  in  the  United  States  in  this  age  group  have  decreased  by  more 
than  30%,  resulting  largely  from  early  detection  and  improved  treat-
ment.  During  the  same  period  of  time,  however,  the  incidence  rate 
for colorectal cancer in men and women <50 years of age, having no 
enhanced genetic risk factor or family history for the disease, has risen 
by 2% each year with the presence of symptoms in this age group often 
being initially attributed to other causes, resulting in a more advanced 
disease  stage  at  the  time  of  diagnosis  being  frequently  observed.  
A corresponding increase in mortality rates from colorectal cancer in 
this young adult population is now evident while, simultaneously, the 
trend for a decreased death rate in older individuals has continued. No 
distinguishing etiologic or molecular factor or clinical characteristic to 
account for the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger men 
and women has yet been identified with lifestyle patterns, such as diet 
and obesity beginning at an earlier age, having been proposed.

PART 4Oncology and Hematology ■ POLYPS AND MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS
Most colorectal cancers, regardless of etiology, arise from adenomatous 
polyps. A polyp is a grossly visible protrusion from the mucosal surface 
and  may  be  classified  pathologically  as  a  nonneoplastic  hamartoma 
(e.g.,  juvenile  polyp),  a  hyperplastic  mucosal  proliferation  (hyper-
plastic  polyp),  or  an  adenomatous  polyp.  Only  adenomas  are  clearly 
premalignant, and only a minority of adenomatous polyps evolve into 
cancer. Adenomatous polyps may be found in the colons of ~30% of 
middle-aged and ~50% of elderly people; however, <1% of polyps ever 
become  malignant.  Most  polyps  produce  no  symptoms  and  remain 
clinically  undetected.  Occult  blood  in  the  stool  is  found  in  <5%  of 
patients with polyps.

A number of molecular changes are noted in adenomatous polyps 
and colorectal cancers that are thought to reflect a multistep process 
in the evolution of normal colonic mucosa to life-threatening invasive 
carcinoma. These developmental steps toward carcinogenesis include, 
but are not restricted to, point mutations in the K-ras proto-oncogene; 
hypomethylation  of  DNA,  leading  to  gene  activation;  loss  of  DNA 
(allelic loss) at the site of a tumor-suppressor gene (the adenomatous 
polyposis coli [APC] gene) on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q21); 
allelic loss at the site of a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromo-
some  18q  (the  deleted  in  colorectal  cancer  [DCC]  gene);  and  allelic 
loss at chromosome 17p, associated with mutations in the p53 tumor-
suppressor gene (see Fig. 71-2). Thus, the altered proliferative pattern 
of the colonic mucosa, which results in progression to a polyp and then 
to  carcinoma,  may  involve  the  mutational  activation  of  an  oncogene 
followed by and coupled with the loss of genes that normally suppress 
tumorigenesis.  It  remains  uncertain  whether  the  genetic  aberrations 
always occur in a defined order. Based on this model, however, cancer 
is believed to develop only in those polyps in which most (if not all) of 
these mutational events take place.

Clinically,  the  probability  of  an  adenomatous  polyp  becoming  a 
cancer  depends  on  the  gross  appearance  of  the  lesion,  its  histologic 
features, and its size. Polyps may be pedunculated (stalked) or sessile 
(flat-based), adenomatous or serrated. Invasive cancers develop more 
frequently  in  sessile,  serrated  (i.e.,  “flat”)  polyps.  Histologically,  ade-
nomatous polyps may be tubular, villous (i.e., papillary), or tubulovil-
lous. Villous adenomas, most of which are sessile, become malignant 
more  than  three  times  as  often  as  tubular  adenomas.  The  likelihood 
that  any  polypoid  lesion  in  the  large  bowel  contains  invasive  cancer 
is  related  to  the  size  of  the  polyp,  being  negligible  (<2%)  in  lesions  
<1.5 cm, intermediate (2–10%) in lesions 1.5–2.5 cm, and substantial 
(10%) in lesions >2.5 cm in size.

Following  the  detection  of  an  adenomatous  polyp,  the  entire 
large bowel should be visualized endoscopically because synchronous 
lesions  are  noted  in  about  one-third  of  cases.  Colonoscopy  should 
then  be  repeated  periodically,  even  in  the  absence  of  a  previously 
documented malignancy, because such patients have a 30–50% proba-
bility of developing another adenoma and are at a higher-than-average 
risk  for  developing  a  colorectal  carcinoma.  Adenomatous  polyps  are 
thought to require >5 years of growth before becoming clinically sig-
nificant;  colonoscopy  need  not  be  carried  out  more  frequently  than 
every 3 years for the vast majority of patients.

Diet  The  etiology  for  most  cases  of  large-bowel  cancer  appears  to 
be related to environmental factors. The disease occurs more often in 
upper socioeconomic populations who live in urban areas. Mortality 
from  colorectal  cancer  is  directly  correlated  with  per  capita  con-
sumption  of  calories,  meat  protein,  and  dietary  fat  and  oil  as  well  as 
elevations in the serum cholesterol concentration and mortality from 
coronary  artery  disease.  Geographic  variations  in  incidence  largely 
are  unrelated  to  genetic  differences  because  migrant  groups  tend  to 
assume the large-bowel cancer incidence rates of their adopted coun-
tries. Furthermore, population groups such as Mormons and Seventh 
Day  Adventists,  whose  lifestyle  and  dietary  habits  differ  somewhat 
from those of their neighbors, have significantly lower-than-expected 
incidence  and  mortality  rates  for  colorectal  cancer.  The  incidence  of 
colorectal cancer has increased in Japan since that nation has adopted 
a more “Western” diet. At least three hypotheses have been proposed 
to explain the relationship to diet, none of which is fully satisfactory.
ANIMAL  FATS  One  hypothesis  is  that  the  ingestion  of  animal  fats 
found in red meats and processed meat leads to an increased propor-
tion of anaerobes in the gut microflora (the “microbiome”), resulting in 
the conversion of normal bile acids into carcinogens. This provocative 
hypothesis  is  supported  by  several  reports  of  increased  amounts  of 
fecal anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis) in the 
stools of patients with colorectal cancer. Diets high in animal (but not 
vegetable) fats are also associated with high serum cholesterol, which 
is also associated with enhanced risk for the development of colorectal 
adenomas and carcinomas.
INSULIN RESISTANCE  The large number of calories in Western diets 
coupled  with  physical  inactivity  has  been  associated  with  a  higher 
prevalence  of  obesity.  Obese  persons  develop  insulin  resistance  with 
increased  circulating  levels  of  insulin,  leading  to  higher  circulating 
concentrations of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I). This growth 
factor appears to stimulate proliferation of the intestinal mucosa.
FIBER  Contrary to prior beliefs, the results of randomized trials and 
case-controlled studies have failed to show any value for dietary fiber 
or diets high in fruits and vegetables in preventing the recurrence of 
colorectal adenomas or the development of colorectal cancer.

The weight of epidemiologic evidence, however, implicates diet as 
being the major etiologic factor for colorectal cancer, particularly diets 
high in animal fat and in calories.

 ■ HEREDITARY FACTORS AND SYNDROMES
Up to 25% of patients with colorectal cancer have a family history of 
the  disease,  suggesting  a  hereditary  predisposition.  Inherited  large-
bowel cancers can be divided into two main groups: the well-studied 
but uncommon polyposis syndromes and the more common nonpoly-
posis syndromes (Table 81-2).

Polyposis  Coli  Polyposis  coli  (familial  polyposis  of  the  colon) 
is  a  rare  condition  characterized  by  the  appearance  of  thousands  of 
adenomatous polyps throughout the large bowel. It is transmitted as an 
autosomal dominant trait; the occasional patient with no family history 
probably developed the condition due to a spontaneous mutation. Poly-
posis coli is associated with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 
5 (including the APC gene) in both neoplastic (somatic mutation) and 
normal (germline mutation) cells. The loss of this genetic material (i.e., 
allelic  loss)  results  in  the  absence  of  tumor-suppressor  genes  whose 
protein products would normally inhibit neoplastic growth. The pres-
ence of soft tissue and bony tumors, congenital hypertrophy of the ret-
inal pigment epithelium, mesenteric desmoid tumors, and ampullary 
cancers in addition to the colonic polyps characterizes a subset of poly-
posis coli known as Gardner’s syndrome. The appearance of malignant 
tumors  of  the  central  nervous  system  accompanying  polyposis  coli 
defines  Turcot’s  syndrome.  The  colonic  polyps  in  all  these  conditions 
are rarely present before puberty but are generally evident in affected 
individuals  by  age  25  years.  If  the  polyposis  is  not  treated  surgically, 
colorectal  cancer  will  develop  in  almost  all  patients  aged  <40  years. 
Polyposis coli results from a defect in the colonic mucosa, leading to an 
abnormal proliferative pattern and impaired DNA repair mechanisms.

Once  the  multiple  polyps  are  detected,  patients  should  undergo  a 
total colectomy. Medical therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs  (NSAIDs)  such  as  sulindac  and  selective  cyclooxygenase-2 
inhibitors such as celecoxib can decrease the number and size of polyps 
in patients with polyposis coli; however, this effect on polyps is only 
temporary, and the use of NSAIDs has not been shown to reduce the 
risk  of  cancer.  Colectomy  remains  the  primary  therapy/prevention. 
The offspring of patients with polyposis coli, who often are prepubertal 
when the diagnosis is made in the parent, have a 50% risk for devel-
oping this premalignant disorder and should be carefully screened by 
annual flexible sigmoidoscopy until age 35 years. Proctosigmoidoscopy 
is  a  sufficient  screening  procedure  because  polyps  tend  to  be  evenly 
distributed from cecum to anus, making more invasive and expensive 
techniques such as colonoscopy or barium enema unnecessary. Testing 
for occult blood in the stool is an inadequate screening maneuver. If 
a causative germline APC mutation has been identified in an affected 
family member, an alternative method for identifying carriers is testing 
DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the presence of the 
specific APC mutation. The detection of such a germline mutation can 
lead to a definitive diagnosis before the development of polyps.

MYH-Associated  Polyposis  MYH-associated  polyposis  (MAP) 
is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome caused by a biallelic mutation 
in  the  MUT4H  gene.  This  hereditary  condition  may  have  a  variable 
clinical  presentation,  resembling  polyposis  coli  or  colorectal  cancer 
occurring  in  younger  individuals  without  polyposis.  Screening  and 
colectomy guidelines for this syndrome are less clear than for polyposis 
coli, but annual to biennial colonoscopic surveillance is generally rec-
ommended starting at age 25–30 years.

Lynch Syndrome  Lynch  syndrome,  previously  known  as  heredi-
tary nonpolyposis colon cancer, is another autosomal dominant trait. 
It  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  three  or  more  relatives  with 
histologically  documented  colorectal  cancer,  one  of  whom  is  a  first- 
degree relative of the other two; one or more cases of colorectal cancer 
diagnosed before age 50 in the family; and colorectal cancer involving 
at least two generations. In contrast to polyposis coli, Lynch syndrome 
is associated with an unusually high frequency of cancer arising in the 
proximal large bowel. The median age for the appearance of an adeno-
carcinoma is <50 years, 10–15 years younger than the median age for 
the general population. Despite having a poorly differentiated, muci-
nous histologic appearance, the proximal colon tumors that character-
ize Lynch syndrome have a better prognosis than sporadic tumors from 
patients  of  similar  age.  Families  with  Lynch  syndrome  often  include 
individuals with multiple primary cancers; the association of colorectal 
cancer  with  either  ovarian  or  endometrial  carcinomas  is  especially 
strong in women, and an increased appearance of gastric, small-bowel, 
genitourinary, pancreaticobiliary, and sebaceous skin tumors has been 

reported  as  well.  It  has  been  recommended  that  members  of  such 
families  undergo  annual  or  biennial  colonoscopy  beginning  at  age 
25  years,  with  intermittent  pelvic  ultrasonography  and  endometrial 
biopsy for afflicted women; such a screening strategy has not yet been 
validated.  Lynch  syndrome  is  associated  with  germline  mutations  of 
several genes, particularly hMSH2 on chromosome 2 and hMLH1 on 
chromosome 3. These mutations lead to errors in DNA replication and 
are thought to result in DNA instability because of defective repair of 
DNA mismatches resulting in abnormal cell growth and tumor devel-
opment.  Testing  tumor  cells  through  molecular  analysis  of  DNA  for 
“microsatellite instability” or immunohistochemical staining for defi-
ciency in mismatch repair proteins in patients with colorectal cancer 
and a positive family history for colorectal or endometrial cancer may 
identify probands with Lynch syndrome.

 ■ INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
(Chap. 326) Large-bowel cancer is increased in incidence in patients 
with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cancers develop 
more commonly in patients with ulcerative colitis than in those with 
granulomatous (i.e., Crohn’s) colitis, but this impression may result in 
part from the occasional difficulty of differentiating these two condi-
tions. The risk of colorectal cancer in a patient with IBD is relatively 
small  during  the  initial  10  years  of  the  disease,  but  then  appears  to 
increase at a rate of ~0.5–1% per year. Cancer may develop in 8–30% 
of patients after 25 years. The risk is higher in younger patients with 
pancolitis.

Cancer  surveillance  strategies  in  patients  with  IBD  are  unsatisfac-
tory.  Symptoms  such  as  bloody  diarrhea,  abdominal  cramping,  and 
obstruction, which may signal the appearance of a tumor, are similar 
to the complaints caused by a flare-up of the underlying inflammatory 
disease. In patients with a history of IBD lasting ≥15 years who con-
tinue  to  experience  exacerbations,  the  surgical  removal  of  the  colon 
can significantly reduce the risk for cancer and also eliminate the target 
organ for the underlying chronic gastrointestinal disorder. The value 
of such surveillance techniques as colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies 
and  brushings  for  less  symptomatic  individuals  with  chronic  IBD  is 
uncertain. The lack of uniformity regarding the pathologic criteria that 
characterize  dysplasia  and  the  absence  of  data  that  such  surveillance 
reduces the development of lethal cancers have made this costly prac-
tice an area of controversy.

 ■ OTHER HIGH-RISK CONDITIONS
Streptococcus bovis Bacteremia  For  unknown  reasons,  individu-
als who develop endocarditis or septicemia from this fecal bacterium 
have a high incidence of occult colorectal tumors and, possibly, upper 
gastrointestinal cancers as well. Endoscopic or radiographic screening 
appears advisable.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyTobacco  Use  Cigarette  smoking  is  linked  to  the  development  of 
colorectal  adenomas,  particularly  after  >35  years  of  tobacco  use.  No 
biologic explanation for this association has yet been proposed.
 ■ PRIMARY PREVENTION
Several orally administered compounds have been assessed as possible 
inhibitors of colon cancer. The most effective class of chemopreventive 
agents is aspirin and other NSAIDs, which are thought to suppress cell 
proliferation  by  inhibiting  prostaglandin  synthesis.  Regular  aspirin 
use  reduces  the  risk  of  colon  adenomas  and  carcinomas  as  well  as 
death from large-bowel cancer; such use also appears to diminish the 
likelihood for developing additional premalignant adenomas following 
successful treatment for a prior colon carcinoma. This effect of aspirin 
on  colon  carcinogenesis  increases  with  the  duration  and  dosage  of 
drug use. Emerging data linking adequate plasma levels of vitamin D 
with reduced risk of adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer appear 
promising.  The  value  of  vitamin  D  as  a  form  of  chemoprevention  is 
under study. Antioxidant vitamins such as ascorbic acid, tocopherols, 
and β-carotene are ineffective at reducing the incidence of subsequent 
adenomas  in  patients  who  have  undergone  the  removal  of  a  colon 
adenoma.  Estrogen  replacement  therapy  has  been  associated  with  a 
reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer in women, conceivably by an 
effect on bile acid synthesis and composition or by decreasing synthesis 
of IGF-I.
 ■ SCREENING
The  rationale  for  colorectal  cancer  screening  programs  is  that  the 
removal  of  adenomatous  polyps  will  prevent  colorectal  cancer,  and 
that earlier detection of localized, superficial cancers in asymptomatic 
individuals  will  increase  the  surgical  cure  rate.  Such  screening  pro-
grams are particularly important for individuals with a family history 
of the disease in first-degree relatives. The relative risk for developing 
colorectal  cancer  increases  to  1.75  in  such  individuals  and  may  be 
even higher if the relative was afflicted before age 60 years. The prior 
use of rigid proctosigmoidoscopy as a screening tool was based on the 
observation that 60% of early lesions are located in the rectosigmoid. 
For  unexplained  reasons,  however,  the  proportion  of  large-bowel 
cancers  arising  in  the  rectum  has  been  decreasing  during  the  past 
several  decades,  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  proportion  of 
cancers in the more proximal descending colon. As such, the potential 
for rigid proctosigmoidoscopy to detect a sufficient number of occult 
neoplasms to make the procedure cost-effective has been questioned.

Screening strategies for colorectal cancer that have been examined 

during the past several decades are listed in Table 81-3.

Many programs directed at the early detection of colorectal cancers 
have focused on digital rectal examinations and fecal occult blood (i.e., 
stool guaiac) testing. The digital examination should be part of any rou-
tine physical evaluation in adults aged >40 years, serving as a screening 
test for prostate cancer in men, a component of the pelvic examination 
in women, and an inexpensive maneuver for the detection of masses in 
the rectum. However, because of the proximal migration of colorectal 
tumors, its value as an overall screening modality for colorectal cancer 
has become limited. The development of the fecal occult blood test has 
greatly  facilitated  the  detection  of  occult  fecal  blood.  Unfortunately, 
even when performed optimally, the fecal occult blood test has major

limitations as a screening technique. About 50% of patients with docu-
mented colorectal cancers have a negative fecal occult blood test, con-
sistent  with  the  intermittent  bleeding  pattern  of  these  tumors.  When 
random  cohorts  of  asymptomatic  persons  have  been  tested,  2–4% 
have  fecal  occult  blood-positive  stools.  Colorectal  cancers  have  been 
found in <10% of these “test-positive” cases, with benign polyps being 
detected in an additional 20–30%. Thus, a colorectal neoplasm will not 
be found in most asymptomatic individuals with occult blood in their 
stool.  Nonetheless,  persons  found  to  have  fecal  occult  blood-positive 
stool routinely undergo further medical evaluation, including sigmoi-
doscopy and/or colonoscopy—procedures that are not only uncomfort-
able and expensive but also associated with a small risk for significant 
complications. The added cost of these studies would appear justifiable 
if the small number of patients found to have occult neoplasms because 
of  fecal  occult  blood  screening  could  be  shown  to  have  an  improved 
prognosis and prolonged survival. Prospectively controlled trials have 
shown  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  mortality  rate  from  col-
orectal cancer for individuals undergoing annual stool guaiac screen-
ing.  However,  this  benefit  only  emerged  after  >13  years  of  follow-up 
and was extremely expensive to achieve because all positive tests (most 
of which were falsely positive) were followed by colonoscopy. Moreover, 
these colonoscopic examinations quite likely provided the opportunity 
for cancer prevention through the removal of potentially premalignant 
adenomatous polyps because the eventual development of cancer was 
reduced by 20% in the cohort undergoing annual screening.

With the appreciation that the carcinogenic process leading to the 
progression of the normal bowel mucosa to an adenomatous polyp and 
then to a cancer is the result of a series of molecular changes, investi-
gators have examined fecal DNA for evidence of mutations associated 
with  such  molecular  changes  as  evidence  of  the  occult  presence  of 
precancerous lesions or actual malignancies. Such a strategy has been 
tested in >4000 asymptomatic individuals whose stool was assessed for 
occult blood and for 21 possible mutations in fecal DNA; these study 
subjects  also  underwent  colonoscopy.  Although  the  fecal  DNA  strat-
egy  proved  to  be  more  effective  for  suggesting  the  presence  of  more 
advanced adenomas and cancers than did the fecal occult blood testing 
approach,  the  overall  sensitivity,  using  colonoscopic  findings  as  the 
standard, was <50%, diminishing enthusiasm for further pursuit of the 
fecal DNA screening strategy.

The use of imaging studies to screen for colorectal cancers has also 
been explored. Air contrast barium enemas had been used to identify 
sources  of  occult  blood  in  the  stool  prior  to  the  advent  of  fiberoptic 
endoscopy;  the  cumbersome  nature  of  the  procedure  and  inconve-
nience  to  patients  limited  its  widespread  adoption.  The  introduction 
of CT scanning led to the development of virtual (i.e., CT) colonog-
raphy  as  an  alternative  to  the  growing  use  of  endoscopic  screening 
techniques. Virtual colonography was proposed as being equivalent in 
sensitivity  to  colonoscopy  and  being  available  in  a  more  widespread 
manner because it did not require the same degree of operator exper-
tise  as  fiberoptic  endoscopy.  However,  virtual  colonography  requires 
the same cathartic preparation that has limited widespread acceptance 
in  association  with  endoscopic  colonoscopy,  is  diagnostic  but  not 
therapeutic  (i.e.,  patients  with  suspicious  findings  must  undergo  a 
subsequent endoscopic procedure for polypectomy or biopsy), and, in 
the setting of general radiology practices, appears to be less sensitive 
as a screening technique when compared with endoscopic procedures.
With the appreciation of the inadequacy of fecal occult blood testing 
alone, concerns about the practicality of imaging approaches, and the 
wider adoption of endoscopic examinations by the primary care com-
munity,  screening  strategies  in  asymptomatic  persons  have  changed. 
At  present,  the  American  Cancer  Society,  the  American  College  of 
Gastroenterology,  and  the  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network 
recommend  either  fecal  occult  blood  testing  annually  coupled  with 
flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years in 
asymptomatic individuals with no personal or family history of polyps 
or colorectal cancer. In view of the emerging increase in the incidence 
of colorectal cancer in individuals <50 years of age, guidelines issued 
from  these  organizations  have  recently  lowered  the  age  at  which  to 
begin such screening from age 50 to age 45 years. The recommendation

for  the  inclusion  of  flexible  sigmoidoscopy  is  strongly  supported  by 
the recently published results of three randomized trials performed in 
the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy, involving >350,000 
individuals,  which  consistently  showed  that  periodic  (even  single) 
sigmoidoscopic  examinations,  after  more  than  a  decade  of  median 
follow-up, lead to an ~21% reduction in the development of colorectal 
cancer and a >25% reduction in mortality from the malignant disease. 
Less than 20% of participants in these studies underwent a subsequent 
colonoscopy.  In  contrast  to  the  cathartic  preparation  required  before 
colonoscopic  procedures,  which  is  only  performed  by  highly  trained 
specialists,  flexible  sigmoidoscopy  requires  only  an  enema  as  prepa-
ration and can be accurately performed by nonspecialty physicians or 
physician-extenders. The randomized screening studies using flexible 
sigmoidoscopy led to the estimate that ~650 individuals needed to be 
screened  to  prevent  one  colorectal  cancer  death;  this  contrasts  with 
the data for mammography where the number of women needing to 
be screened to prevent one breast cancer death is 2500, reinforcing the 
efficacy of endoscopic surveillance for colorectal cancer screening. Pre-
sumably the benefit from the sigmoidoscopic screening is the result of 
the identification and removal of adenomatous polyps; it is intriguing 
that  this  benefit  has  been  achieved  using  a  technique  that  leaves  the 
proximal half of the large bowel unvisualized.

It remains to be seen whether surveillance colonoscopy, which has 
gained increasing popularity in the United States for colorectal cancer 
screening, will prove to be more effective than flexible sigmoidoscopy 
in  reducing  mortality  from  this  disease.  Ongoing  randomized  trials 
being conducted in Europe are addressing this issue. Although flexible 
sigmoidoscopy only visualizes the distal half of the large bowel, leading 
to  the  assumption  that  colonoscopy  represents  a  more  informative 
approach,  colonoscopy  has  been  reported  as  being  less  accurate  for 
screening  the  proximal  rather  than  the  distal  colon,  perhaps  due  to 
technical  considerations  but  also  possibly  because  of  a  greater  fre-
quency  of  serrated  (i.e.,  “flat”)  polyps  in  the  right  colon,  which  are 
more difficult to identify. Furthermore, the vast majority of colorectal 
cancers  that  have  appeared  in  younger  adults  have  arisen  in  the  left 
colon  (i.e.,  distal  to  the  splenic  flexure),  within  the  visible  range  of 
a  flexible  sigmoidoscopy.  At  present,  colonoscopy  performed  every  
10 years has been offered as an alternative to annual fecal occult blood 
testing with periodic (every 5 years) flexible sigmoidoscopy. Colonos-
copy has been shown to be superior to double-contrast barium enema 
and also to have a higher sensitivity for detecting villous or dysplastic 
adenomas or cancers than the strategy using occult fecal blood testing 
and  flexible  sigmoidoscopy.  Whether  colonoscopy  performed  every 
10  years  beginning  at  age  45  is  medically  superior  and  economically 
equivalent to flexible sigmoidoscopy remains to be determined.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Presenting  Symptoms  Symptoms  vary  with  the  anatomic  loca-
tion of the tumor. Because stool is relatively liquid as it passes through 
the  ileocecal  valve  into  the  right  colon,  cancers  arising  in  the  cecum 
and ascending colon may become quite large without resulting in any 
obstructive symptoms or noticeable alterations in bowel habits. Lesions 
of  the  right  colon  commonly  ulcerate,  leading  to  chronic,  insidious 
blood  loss  without  a  change  in  the  appearance  of  the  stool.  Conse-
quently, patients with tumors of the ascending colon often present with 
symptoms such as fatigue, palpitations, and even angina pectoris and 
are found to have a hypochromic, microcytic anemia, indicative of iron 
deficiency. Because the cancers may bleed intermittently, a random fecal 
occult blood test may be negative. As a result, the unexplained presence 
of iron-deficiency anemia in any adult (with the possible exception of a 
premenopausal, multiparous woman) mandates a thorough endoscopic 
and/or radiographic visualization of the entire large bowel (Fig. 81-1).
Because stool becomes more formed as it passes into the transverse 
and descending colon, tumors arising there tend to impede the passage 
of  stool,  resulting  in  the  development  of  abdominal  cramping,  occa-
sional obstruction, and even perforation. Radiographs of the abdomen 
often reveal characteristic annular, constricting lesions (“apple-core” or 
“napkin-ring”) (Fig. 81-2).

FIGURE  81-1  Double-contrast  air-barium  enema  revealing  a  sessile  tumor  of  the 
cecum in a patient with iron-deficiency anemia and guaiac-positive stool. The lesion 
at surgery was a stage II adenocarcinoma. 

Cancers arising in the rectosigmoid are often associated with hema-
tochezia, tenesmus, and narrowing of the caliber of stool; anemia is an 
infrequent finding. While these symptoms may lead patients and their 
physicians to suspect the presence of hemorrhoids, the development of 
rectal bleeding and/or altered bowel habits demands a prompt digital 
rectal examination and proctosigmoidoscopy.
Staging,  Prognostic  Factors,  and  Patterns  of  Spread  The 
prognosis  for  individuals  having  colorectal  cancer  is  related  to  the 
depth  of  tumor  penetration  into  the  bowel  wall  and  the  presence  of 
both  regional  lymph  node  involvement  and  distant  metastases.  These 
variables are incorporated into a TNM classification method, in which 
T represents the depth of tumor penetration, N the presence of lymph 
node involvement, and M the presence or absence of distant metastases

radiographic  appearance  is  referred  to  as  an  “apple-core”  lesion  and  is  always 
highly suggestive of malignancy.

FIGURE 81-3  Staging and prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.

(Fig. 81-3). Superficial lesions that do not involve regional lymph nodes 
and do not penetrate through the submucosa (T1) or the muscularis (T2) 
are  designated  as  stage  I  (T1–2N0M0)  disease;  tumors  that  penetrate 
through the muscularis but have not spread to lymph nodes are stage II 
disease (T3-4N0M0); regional lymph node involvement defines stage III 
(TXN1-2M0) disease; and metastatic spread to sites such as liver, lung, 
or bone indicates stage IV (TXNXM1) disease. Unless gross evidence of 
metastatic disease is present, disease stage cannot be determined accu-
rately before surgical resection and pathologic analysis of the operative 
specimens.

Most recurrences after a surgical resection of a large-bowel cancer 
occur  within  the  first  4  years,  making  5-year  survival  a  fairly  reli-
able  indicator  of  cure.  The  likelihood  for  5-year  survival  in  patients 
with  colorectal  cancer  is  stage-related  (Fig.  81-3).  That  likelihood 
has  improved  during  the  past  several  decades  when  similar  surgical 
stages  have  been  compared.  The  most  plausible  explanation  for  this 
improvement is more thorough intraoperative and pathologic staging. 
In particular, more exacting attention to pathologic detail has revealed 
that  the  prognosis  following  the  resection  of  a  colorectal  cancer  is 
not related merely to the presence or absence of regional lymph node 
involvement;  rather,  prognosis  may  be  more  precisely  gauged  by  the 
number of involved lymph nodes (one to three lymph nodes [“N1”] vs 
four or more lymph nodes [“N2”]) and the number of nodes examined. 
A minimum of 12 sampled lymph nodes is thought necessary to accu-
rately  define  tumor  stage,  and  the  more  nodes  examined,  the  better. 
Other  predictors  of  a  poor  prognosis  after  a  total  surgical  resection 
include  tumor  penetration  through  the  bowel  wall  into  pericolic  fat, 
poorly  differentiated  histology,  perforation  and/or  tumor  adherence 
to  adjacent  organs  (increasing  the  risk  for  an  anatomically  adjacent 
recurrence),  and  venous  invasion  by  tumor  (Table  81-4).  Regardless 
of  the  clinicopathologic  stage,  a  preoperative  elevation  of  the  plasma 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level predicts eventual tumor recur-
rence. The presence of specific chromosomal aberrations, particularly 
a  mutation  in  the  b-raf  gene  in  tumor  cells,  appears  to  predict  for  a 
higher risk for metastatic spread. Conversely, the detection of micro-
satellite instability in tumor tissue indicates a more favorable outcome. 
Tumors arising in the left colon are associated with a better prognosis 
than  those  appearing  in  the  right  colon,  likely  due  to  differences  in 
molecular  patterns.  In  contrast  to  most  other  cancers,  the  prognosis 
in colorectal cancer is not influenced by the size of the primary lesion 
when adjusted for nodal involvement and histologic differentiation.

Cancers  of  the  large  bowel  generally  spread  to  regional  lymph 
nodes or to the liver via the portal venous circulation. The liver rep-
resents the most frequent visceral site of metastasis; it is the initial site 
of  distant  spread  in  one-third  of  recurring  colorectal  cancers  and  is 
involved in more than two-thirds of such patients at the time of death. 
In  general,  colorectal  cancer  rarely  spreads  to  the  lungs,  supraclavi-
cular  lymph  nodes,  bone,  or  brain  without  prior  spread  to  the  liver.  
A  major  exception  to  this  rule  occurs  in  patients  having  primary 
tumors  in  the  distal  rectum,  from  which  tumor  cells  may  spread 
through  the  paravertebral  venous  plexus,  escaping  the  portal  venous 
system and thereby reaching the lungs or supraclavicular lymph nodes 
without  hepatic  involvement.  The  median  survival  after  the  detec-
tion of distant metastases has increased during the last 30 years from  
6–9  months  (hepatomegaly,  abnormal  liver  chemistries)  to  27–30 
months  (small  liver  nodule  initially  identified  by  elevated  CEA  level 
and subsequent CT scan) with increasingly effective systemic therapy 
improving this prognosis further.

Efforts to use gene expression profiles to identify patients at risk of 
recurrence or those particularly likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy 
have  not  yet  yielded  practice-changing  results.  Despite  a  burgeoning 
literature  examining  a  host  of  prognostic  factors,  pathologic  stage  at 
diagnosis remains the best predictor of long-term prognosis. Patients 
with  lymphovascular  invasion  and  high  preoperative  CEA  levels  are 
likely to have a more aggressive clinical course.

TREATMENT
Colorectal Cancer

Total resection of tumor is the optimal treatment when a malignant 
lesion is detected in the large bowel. An evaluation for the presence 
of  metastatic  disease,  including  a  thorough  physical  examination, 
biochemical  assessment  of  liver  function,  measurement  of  the 
plasma CEA level, and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, 
should be performed before surgery. When possible, a colonoscopy 
of the entire large bowel should be performed to identify synchro-
nous neoplasms and/or polyps. The detection of metastases should 
not preclude surgery in patients with tumor-related symptoms such 
as gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction, but it often prompts the 
use of a less radical operative procedure. The necessity for a primary 
tumor  resection  in  asymptomatic  individuals  with  metastatic  dis-
ease is an area of controversy. At the time of laparotomy, the entire 
peritoneal cavity should be examined, with thorough inspection of 
the  liver,  pelvis,  and  hemidiaphragm  and  careful  palpation  of  the 
full length of the large bowel. Following recovery from a complete 
resection, patients should be observed carefully for 5 years by semi-
annual physical examinations and blood chemistry measurements. 
If  a  complete  colonoscopy  was  not  performed  preoperatively,  it 
should be carried out within the first several postoperative months. 
Some  authorities  favor  measuring  plasma  CEA  levels  at  3-month 
intervals because of the sensitivity of this test as a marker for oth-
erwise  undetectable  tumor  recurrence.  The  value  of  periodically 
assessing  plasma  for  the  presence  of  circulating  tumor  DNA  as  a 
biomarker for residual or recurrent disease is under study. Subse-
quent endoscopic surveillance of the large bowel, probably at trien-
nial  intervals,  is  indicated,  because  patients  who  have  been  cured 
of one colorectal cancer have a 3–5% probability of developing an 
additional bowel cancer during their lifetime and a >15% risk for 
the  development  of  adenomatous  polyps.  Anastomotic  (“suture-
line”)  recurrences  are  infrequent  in  colorectal  cancer  patients, 
provided the surgical resection margins were adequate and free of 
tumor. The value of periodic CT scans of the abdomen, assessing 
for  an  early,  asymptomatic  indication  of  tumor  recurrence,  while 
uncertain, has been recommended annually for the first 3 postop-
erative years.

Radiation therapy to the pelvis is recommended for patients with 
rectal cancer because it reduces the 20–25% probability of regional 
recurrences following complete surgical resection of stage II or III 
tumors, especially if they have penetrated through the serosa. This 
alarmingly high rate of local disease recurrence is believed to be due 
to the fact that the contained anatomic space within the pelvis limits 
the extent of the resection and because the rich lymphatic network 
of the pelvic side wall immediately adjacent to the rectum facilitates 
the early spread of malignant cells into surgically inaccessible tissue. 
The use of sharp rather than blunt dissection of rectal cancers (total 
mesorectal excision) appears to reduce the likelihood of local disease 
recurrence to ~10%. Radiation therapy, either administered pre- or 
postoperatively, further reduces the likelihood of pelvic recurrences 
but  does  not  appear  to  prolong  survival.  Combining  radiation 
therapy  with  5-fluorouracil  (5-FU)-based  chemotherapy,  prefer-
ably  prior  to  surgical  resection,  lowers  local  recurrence  rates  and 
improves overall survival. Radiation therapy alone is not effective 
as the primary treatment of colon cancer.

Systemic therapy for patients with colorectal cancer has become 
more  effective.  5-FU  remains  the  backbone  of  treatment  for  this 
disease. Partial responses are obtained in 15–20% of patients. The 
probability  of  tumor  response  appears  to  be  somewhat  greater 
for  patients  with  liver  metastases  when  chemotherapy  is  infused 
directly into the hepatic artery, but intraarterial treatment is costly 
and  toxic  and  does  not  appear  to  appreciably  prolong  survival. 
The  concomitant  administration  of  folinic  acid  (leucovorin  [LV]) 
improves the efficacy of 5-FU in patients with advanced colorectal 
cancer,  presumably  by  enhancing  the  binding  of  5-FU  to  its  tar-
get enzyme, thymidylate synthase. 5-FU is generally administered 

intravenously but may also be given orally in the form of capecita-
bine (Xeloda) with seemingly similar efficacy.

Irinotecan (CPT-11), a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, has been added 
to  5-FU  and  LV  (e.g.,  FOLFIRI)  with  resultant  improvement  in 
response rates and survival of patients with metastatic disease. The 
FOLFIRI regimen is as follows: irinotecan, 180 mg/m2 as a 90-min 
infusion on day 1; LV, 400 mg/m2 as a 2-h infusion during irinotecan 
administration;  immediately  followed  by  5-FU  bolus,  400  mg/m2, 
and 46-h continuous infusion of 2.4–3 g/m2 every 2 weeks. Diarrhea 
is the major side effect from irinotecan. Oxaliplatin, a platinum ana-
logue, also improves the response rate when added to 5-FU and LV 
(FOLFOX) as initial treatment of patients with metastatic disease. 
The FOLFOX regimen is as follows: 2-h infusion of LV (400 mg/m2 
per day) followed by a 5-FU bolus (400 mg/m2 per day) and 22-h 
infusion  (1200  mg/m2)  every  2  weeks,  together  with  oxaliplatin,   
85 mg/m2 as a 2-h infusion on day 1. Oxaliplatin frequently causes 
a  dose-dependent  sensory  neuropathy  that  often  but  not  always 
resolves following the cessation of therapy. FOLFIRI and FOLFOX 
are equal in efficacy. In metastatic disease, these regimens may pro-
duce median survivals of 2 years.

Monoclonal  antibodies  are  also  effective  in  patients  with 
advanced  colorectal  cancer.  Cetuximab  (Erbitux)  and  panitu-
mumab (Vectibix) are directed against the epidermal growth factor 
receptor  (EGFR),  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein  involved  in  sig-
naling pathways affecting growth and proliferation of tumor cells. 
Both  cetuximab  and  panitumumab,  when  given  alone,  have  been 
shown to benefit a small proportion of previously treated patients, 
and  cetuximab  appears  to  have  therapeutic  synergy  with  such 
chemotherapeutic agents as irinotecan, even in patients previously 
resistant to this drug; this suggests that cetuximab can reverse cel-
lular resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The antibodies are not 
effective in the ~65% subset of colon tumors that contain mutations 
in ras or b-raf genes and appear to be less likely to prove beneficial 
in  the  treatment  of  tumors  arising  from  the  right  rather  than  left 
colon. The use of both cetuximab and panitumumab can lead to an 
acne-like rash, with the development and severity of the rash being 
correlated  with  the  likelihood  of  antitumor  efficacy.  Inhibitors  of 
the EGFR tyrosine kinase such as erlotinib (Tarceva) or sunitinib 
(Sutent) do not appear to be effective in colorectal cancer.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a monoclonal antibody directed against 
the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is thought to act 
as an antiangiogenesis agent. The addition of bevacizumab to irino-
tecan-containing combinations and to FOLFOX appears to signifi-
cantly  improve  the  outcome  observed  with  chemotherapy  alone. 
The use of bevacizumab can lead to hypertension, proteinuria, and 
an increased likelihood of thromboembolic events.

Emerging  data  suggest  that  the  use  of  checkpoint  inhibitors 
(i.e.,  PD-1  and  PD-2)  as  immunotherapy  is  more  effective  than 
chemotherapy  in  the  subset  (15%)  of  patients  with  metastatic 
colorectal cancer whose tumors are mismatch repair protein defi-
cient  (i.e.,  microsatellite  unstable).  Patients  with  solitary  hepatic 
metastases without clinical or radiographic evidence of additional 
tumor involvement should be considered for partial liver resection, 
because  such  procedures  are  associated  with  5-year  survival  rates 
of 25–30% when performed on selected individuals by experienced 
surgeons.

The administration of 5-FU and LV for 6 months after resection 
of tumor in patients with stage III disease leads to a 40% decrease in 
recurrence rates and 30% improvement in survival. The likelihood of 
recurrence has been further reduced when oxaliplatin has been com-
bined with 5-FU and LV (e.g., FOLFOX). Reducing the duration 
of such oxaliplatin-containing therapy from 6 months to 3 months 
in  patients  with  less  invasive  tumors  (T2-3N1)  has  been  shown  to 
result in a similar therapeutic benefit with reduced side effects (i.e., 
neurotoxicity)  whereas  6  months  of  such  therapy  continues  to  be 
recommended for optimally treating patients with more advanced 
stage III tumors (T4 and/or N2). Unexpectedly, the addition of irino-
tecan to 5-FU and LV as well as the addition of either bevacizumab 
or cetuximab to FOLFOX did not significantly enhance outcome.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyPatients with stage II tumors do not appear to benefit appreciably 
from  adjuvant  therapy,  with  the  use  of  such  treatment  generally 
restricted  to  those  patients  having  biologic  characteristics  (e.g., 
perforated tumors, T4 lesions, lymphovascular invasion) that place 
them at higher likelihood for recurrence.

In  rectal  cancer,  the  delivery  of  preoperative  or  postoperative 
combined-modality  therapy  (5-FU  or  capecitabine  plus  radiation 
therapy) reduces the risk of recurrence and increases the chance of 
cure for patients with stage II and III tumors, with the preoperative 
approach being better tolerated.

CANCERS OF THE ANUS
Cancers of the anus account for 1–2% of the malignant tumors of the 
large  bowel.  Most  such  lesions  arise  in  the  anal  canal,  the  anatomic 
area extending from the anorectal ring to a zone approximately halfway 
between the pectinate (or dentate) line and the anal verge. Carcinomas 
arising  proximal  to  the  pectinate  line  (i.e.,  in  the  transitional  zone 
between the glandular mucosa of the rectum and the squamous epithe-
lium of the distal anus) are known as basaloid, cuboidal, or cloacogenic 
tumors;  about  one-third  of  anal  cancers  have  this  histologic  pattern. 
Malignancies  arising  distal  to  the  pectinate  line  have  squamous  his-
tology, ulcerate more frequently, and constitute ~55% of anal cancers. 
The prognosis for patients with basaloid and squamous cell cancers of 
the anus is identical when corrected for tumor size and the presence or 
absence of nodal spread.

The  development  of  anal  cancer  is  associated  with  infection  by 
human papillomavirus, the same organism etiologically linked to cer-
vical  and  oro-pharyngeal  cancers.  The  virus  is  sexually  transmitted. 
The infection may lead to anal warts (condyloma acuminata), which 
may progress to anal intraepithelial neoplasia and on to squamous cell 
carcinoma.  The  risk  for  anal  cancer  is  increased  among  homosexual 
males,  presumably  related  to  anal  intercourse.  Anal  cancer  risk  is 
increased in both men and women with AIDS, possibly because their 
immunosuppressed  state  permits  more  severe  papillomavirus  infec-
tion. Vaccination against human papilloma viruses appears to reduce 
the eventual risk for anal cancer. Anal cancers occur most commonly 
in  middle-aged  persons  and  are  more  frequent  in  women  than  men. 
At  diagnosis,  patients  may  experience  bleeding,  pain,  sensation  of  a 
perianal mass, and pruritus.

Radical  surgery  (abdominal-perineal  resection  with  lymph  node 
sampling  and  a  permanent  colostomy)  was  once  the  treatment  of 
choice  for  this  tumor  type.  The  5-year  survival  rate  after  such  a 
procedure  was  55–70%  in  the  absence  of  spread  to  regional  lymph 
nodes  and  <20%  if  nodal  involvement  was  present.  An  alternative 
therapeutic approach combining external beam radiation therapy with 
concomitant  chemotherapy  (5-FU  and  mitomycin  C)  has  resulted  in 
biopsy-proven disappearance of all tumor in >80% of patients whose 
initial lesion was <3 cm in size. Tumor recurrences develop in <10% of 
these patients, meaning that ~70% of patients with anal cancers can be 
cured with nonoperative treatment and without the need for a colos-
tomy. Surgery should be reserved for the minority of individuals who 
are  found  to  have  residual  tumor  after  being  managed  initially  with 
radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. The use of checkpoint 
immunotherapy  (i.e.,  PD-1  inhibition)  has  been  beneficial  in  some 
patients with recurrent disease.

82 Tumors of the Liver  
and Biliary Tree
Josep M. Llovet

Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, the fourth 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and the leading cause of death 
among  cirrhotic  patients.  Liver  cancer  comprises  a  heterogeneous 
group of malignant tumors with different histologic features and unfa-
vorable  prognosis  that  range  from  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC; 
85–90%  cases),  intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma  (iCCA;  10%),  and 
other  malignancies  accounting  for  <1%  of  tumors,  such  as  fibrola-
mellar  HCC,  mixed  HCC-iCCA,  epithelioid  hemangiothelioma,  and 
the  pediatric  cancer  hepatoblastoma.  The  burden  of  liver  cancer  is 
increasing globally in almost all countries, and it is estimated to reach 
1 million cases by 2025.

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
Overall,  liver  cancer  accounts  for  7%  of  all  cancers  (~850,000  new 
cases  each  year),  and  HCC  represents  90%  of  primary  liver  cancers. 
The  highest  incidence  rates  of  HCC  occur  in  Asia  and  sub-Saharan 
Africa due to the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 
with 20–35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Southern Europe and North 
America  have  intermediate  incidence  rates  (10  cases  per  100,000), 
whereas  Northern  and  Western  Europe  have  low  incidence  rates  of 
<5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. In the United States, liver cancer is 
ranked number one in terms of increased mortality during the past two 
decades, with an incidence of 35,000 cases per year (Fig. 82-1). HCC 
has  a  strong  male  preponderance  with  a  male-to-female  ratio  esti-
mated to be 2.5. The incidence increases with age, reaching a peak at  
65–70 years old. In Chinese and in black African populations (where 
vertical transmission of HBV occurs), the mean age is 40–50 years. By 
contrast, in Japan, mean age in men is now around 75 years.

The risk factors for HCC are well established (Fig. 82-1). The main 
risk factor is cirrhosis—and associated chronic liver damage caused by 
inflammation  and  fibrosis—of  any  etiology,  which  underlies  80%  of 
HCC cases worldwide and results from chronic infection by HBV or 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcohol abuse, metabolic syndrome, 
and  hemochromatosis  (associated  with  HFE1  gene  germline  muta-
tions). Cirrhotic patients represent 1% of the human population, and 
one-third of them will develop HCC during their lifetime. Long-term 
follow-up studies have established an annual risk of HCC development 
of  3–8%  in  HBV-  or  HCV-infected  cirrhotic  patients.  HCC  is  less 
common (1–3% per year) in cirrhosis associated with alcohol, nonal-
coholic steatohepatitis (NASH), α1 antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune 
hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, and cholestatic liver disorders. Predictors of 
liver  cancer  development  among  cirrhotic  patients  have  been  associ-
ated with liver disease severity (platelet count of <100,000/μL, presence

field effect.

In terms of attributable risk fraction, HBV infection—a DNA virus 
that can cause insertional mutagenesis and affects 400 million people 
globally—accounts for ~60% of HCC cases in Asia and Africa and 20% 
in  the  Western  world.  Among  patients  with  HBV  infection,  a  family 
history of HCC, HBeAg seropositivity, high viral load, and genotype 
C  are  independent  predictors  of  HCC  development.  Chronic  treat-
ments  with  effective  antiviral  HBV  therapies  are  able  to  significantly 
decrease the risk of cancer. HCV infection—an RNA virus that affects 
170 million people—is responsible for ~30% of cases and is the main 
cause  of  HCC  in  Europe  and  North  America.  Among  patients  with 
HCV  infection,  HCC  occurs  almost  exclusively  when  relevant  liver 
damage  is  present  (either  advanced  fibrosis—Metavir  F3  [Metavir  is 
a scoring system for hepatic histology that grades fibrosis from 0 to 4 
with higher numbers indicating more fibrosis]—or cirrhosis), particu-
larly if associated with HCV genotype 1b. In addition, a polymorphism 
that activates EGFR, the epidermal growth factor receptor, is associated 
with HCV-HCC in several studies. Antiviral therapies with interferon 
regimens are able to prevent cirrhosis development and HCC occur-
rence. Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) induce sustained virologic 
response, i.e., clearance of HCV infection, in most of cases, thus result-
ing in 50–80% reduction in HCC risk.

Alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome due to diabetes and 
obesity are responsible for ~30% of cases. NASH is becoming the lead-
ing cause of cirrhosis in developed countries and currently represents 
~15–20% of HCC cases in the West. The annual incidence of HCC in 
NASH-related cirrhosis (1–2%/year) justifies including patients at risk 
in surveillance programs. Nonetheless, it has to be taken into account 
that  25–30%  of  NASH-associated  HCC  occurs  in  the  absence  of  cir-
rhosis. A PNPLA3 polymorphism is strongly associated with fatty and 
alcoholic chronic liver diseases and HCC occurrence. Other cofactors 
contributing to HCC development are tobacco and aflatoxin B1, a fun-
gal carcinogen present in food supplies that induces TP53 mutations. 
Finally, infection with adeno-associated virus 2 is associated with HCC 
in individuals without cirrhosis. Aside from the associations described 
above, genome-wide association studies have not yet confirmed poly-
morphisms predisposing to HCC development.

 ■ MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS
HCC  development  is  a  complex  multistep  process  that  starts  with 
precancerous cirrhotic nodules, so-called low-grade dysplastic nodules 
(LGDNs) that evolve to high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) that 
can  transform  into  early-stage  HCC.  Molecular  studies  support  the 
pivotal role of adult hepatocytes as the cell of origin, either by directly 
transforming  to  HCC  or  by  de-differentiating  into  hepatocyte  pre-
cursor cells. Alternatively, progenitor cells also give rise to HCC with 
progenitor markers.

Genomic analysis has provided a clear picture of the main drivers 
responsible  for  HCC  initiation  and  progression.  This  tumor  results 
from the accumulation of around 40–60 somatic genomic alterations 
per tumor, of which 4–8 are considered driver cancer genes. HCC is a 
prototypical inflammation-associated cancer, where immune microen-
vironment and oxidative stress present in chronically damaged livers 
play  pivotal  roles  in  inducing  mutations.  In  preneoplastic  HGDN, 
mutations  in  telomere  reverse  transcriptase  (TERT)  gene  (20%  of 
cases) and gains in 8q have been described. Oncogenic transformation 
occurs upon additional genomic hits including Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
activation, reexpression of fetal genes, deregulation of protein folding 
machinery, and the response to oxidative stress. Genomic studies and 
next-generation  sequencing  conducted  during  the  past  decade  have 
enabled  a  description  of  the  landscape  of  mutations,  signaling  path-
ways,  and  molecular  classification  of  the  disease.  Nonetheless,  none 
of  these  data  have  yet  translated  into  actual  clinical  benefits  for  any 
specific molecularly based subgroups.

Molecular  Drivers  The  landscape  of  mutational  drivers  in  HCC 
identified by deep-genome sequencing is detailed in Table 82-1. The 
most  common  mutations  are  in  the  TERT  promoter  (56%),  TP53 
(27%), CTNNB1 (26%), ARID2 (7%), ARID1A (6%), and AXIN1 (5%) 
genes. These mutated genes participate in cell-cycle control and senes-
cence  (TERT  and  TP53),  cell  differentiation  (CTNNB1  and  AXIN1), 
and  chromatin  remodeling  (ARID2  and  ARID1A).  Genes  commonly 
mutated in other solid tumors such as EGFR, HER2, PIK3CA, BRAF, 
or KRAS are rarely mutated in HCC (<5%). Overall, only ~20–25% of 
HCCs  have  at  least  one  actionable  mutation.  Some  risk  factors  have 
been  associated  with  specific  molecular  aberrations.  HBV  integrates 
into the genome of driver genes, such as the TERT promoter,  MLL4, 
and cyclin E1 (CCNE1). Alcohol abuse and HCV infection have been

associated  with  CTNNB1  mutations.  TP53  mutations  are  the  most 
frequent  alterations  with  a  specific  hotspot  of  mutation  (R249S)  in 
patients with aflatoxin B1 exposure.

Studies assessing copy number alterations in HCCs have consistently 
identified: (1) high-level amplifications at 5–10% prevalence contain-
ing  oncogenes  in  11q13  (CCND1  and  FGF19)  and  6p21  (VEGFA), 
TERT focal amplification, and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A; and 
(2) common amplifications containing MYC (8q gain) and MET genes 
(focal gains of 7q31). Activation of the FGF19-FGFR4 pathway medi-
ated by epigenetic mechanisms (~20%) or high-level amplifications of 
11q13 (6%) or VEGFA gains (high-level gains of 6p21) are also poten-
tial therapeutic targets.

Signaling  Pathways  Several  signaling  pathways  have  been  impli-
cated in HCC progression and dissemination. Activation of these path-
ways can result from structural alterations (mutations and amplifications/
losses) or epigenetic modifications. In brief, (1) TERT overexpression 
occurs in 90% of cases, particularly related to promoter TERT muta-
tions or amplifications; (2) inactivation of p53 and alterations of cell 
cycle are major defects in HCC, particularly in cases related to HBV 
infection; (3) Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation occurs in 50% of cases, 
either as a result of β-catenin or AXIN1 mutation or overexpression of 
Frizzled receptors or inactivation of E-cadherin; (4) PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathway is activated in 40–50% of HCCs due to mutation and 
focal  deletion  of  the  tuberous  sclerosis  complex  (TSC)1/TSC2  genes, 
PTEN, or ligand overexpression of EGF or insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF)  upstream  signals;  (5)  Ras  MAPK  signaling  is  activated  in  half 
of  early  and  almost  all  advanced  HCCs,  and  activation  results  from 
upstream signaling by EGF, IGF, and MET activation; (6) insulin-like 
growth  factor  receptor  (IGFR)  signaling  is  activated  in  20%  of  cases 
through overexpression of the oncogenic ligand IGF2; (7) dysregula-
tion of the c-MET receptor and its ligand HGF, critical for hepatocyte 
regeneration  after  liver  injury,  is  a  common  event  in  advanced  HCC 
(50%); (8) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is the 
cornerstone of angiogenesis in HCC, along with activated angiogenic 

pathways such as Ang2 and FGF signaling; and (9) chromatin remodel-
ing complexes and epigenetic regulators are frequently altered in HCC 
due to ARID1A and ARID2 mutations.

Molecular and Immune Classes  Genomic studies have revealed 
two molecular subclasses of HCC, each representing ~50% of patients. 
The proliferative subclass is enriched by activation of Ras, mTOR, and 
IGF  signaling  and  FGF19  amplification  and  is  associated  with  HBV- 
related etiologies, overexpression of α-fetoprotein, and poor outcomes. 
By contrast, the so-called nonproliferative subclass contains a subtype 
characterized  by  CTNNB1  mutations  and  better  outcome.  Another 
classification based on immune status has been proposed. It defines an 
immune HCC class in ~25% of cases characterized by immune infil-
trate with expression of PD-1/PD-L1, enrichment of T cell activation, 
and better outcome and an immune excluded class with activation of 
pathways related with immune escape (i.e., Wnt signaling) or absence 
of T cell infiltrate. This excluded class has been proposed to be associ-
ated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, although direct 
translation  of  molecular  subclasses  into  clinical  decision  making  has 
yet to be achieved.

 ■ PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION
Prevention  Primary  prevention  of  HCC  can  be  achieved  by 
vaccination  against  HBV  and  effective  treatment  of  HBV  and  HCV 
infection. Studies assessing the impact of universal vaccination against 
HBV infection have reported a significant decrease of the incidence of 
HCC. HBV vaccination is recommended to all newborns and high-risk 
groups, following World Health Organization guidelines. Vaccination 
is  also  recommended  in  people  with  risk  factors  for  acquiring  HBV 
infection, such as health workers, travelers to areas where HBV infec-
tion  is  prevalent,  injection  drug  users,  and  people  with  multiple  sex 
partners.

Effective  antiviral  treatments  for  patients  with  chronic  HBV  
infection—achieving  undetectable  viral  titers  (circulating  HBV-
DNA)—reduce the risk of HCC development. Evidence of this effect 
is supported by one randomized trial and several cohort studies. Treat-
ment of HCV has dramatically advanced with the new DAAs, which 
yield >90% sustained virologic response (SVR) rates after 12 weeks of 
treatment. This effect has a direct implication in reducing HCC inci-
dence  in  patients  with  cured  chronic  HCV  infection.  Once  cirrhosis 
is  established,  the  incidence  of  HCC  is  lower  for  patients  with  SVR 
than for those with active viral disease, although they continue to have 
persistent  HCC  risk  (>1%  per  year).  Additional  putative  chemopre-
ventive agents have been proposed to reduce HCC incidence in at-risk 
populations.  Aspirin  is  associated  with  HCC  cumulative  incidence 
reduction in large studies from 8% to 4%. Similarly, compelling cohort 
and case-control studies demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship 
between coffee consumption and reduced HCC incidence. As a result, 
coffee consumption is recommended as a chemoprevention strategy in 
patients with chronic liver disease.

Surveillance  The  aim  of  surveillance  is  to  obtain  a  reduction  in 
disease-related mortality. This is usually achieved through early detec-
tion that enhances the applicability and cost-effectiveness of curative 
therapies.  U.S.  and  European  guidelines  recommend  surveillance  for 
patients at high risk for HCC on the basis of cost-effectiveness analyses. 
As a general rule, high-risk populations are considered those present-
ing an incidence cutoff >1.5% for patients with cirrhosis and 0.2% for 
patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  B.  However,  the  strength  of  evidence 
supporting  surveillance  is  modest  and  is  based  on  two  randomized 
studies  conducted  in  China  and  a  meta-analysis  of  observational 
studies.  Overall,  these  studies  conclude  that  surveillance  identifies 
patients with smaller tumors who are more likely to undergo curative 
procedures. Because of lead time bias and length time bias, it cannot be 
concluded that surveillance ultimately reduces HCC-related mortality.
Surveillance is recommended for cirrhotic patients due to any cause, 
those with HCV-related advanced fibrosis (Metavir score of F3), and 
patients  with  chronic  HBV  infection  if  Asian  and  aged  >40  years,  if 
African and aged >20 years, if there is a family history of HCC, or if the

patient has sufficient risk by risk scores such as PAGE-B. In terms of 
liver dysfunction, the presence of advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class 
C)  prevents  potentially  curative  therapies  from  being  employed,  and 
thus  surveillance  is  not  recommended.  As  an  exception,  patients  on 
the waiting list for liver transplantation, regardless of liver functional 
status, should be screened for HCC in order to detect tumors exceeding 
conventional criteria and to define priority policies for transplantation. 
Complex  scoring  systems  to  identify  at-risk  populations  are  not  yet 
recommended by guidelines.

Ultrasonography every 6 months, with or without serum α fetopro-
tein (AFP) levels, is the recommended method of surveillance. It has 
a sensitivity of 65–80% and a specificity of >90% for early detection. 
A 3-month interval does not enhance outcomes, and survival is lower 
with 12-month compared with 6-month intervals. A shorter follow-up 
interval (every 3–4 months) is recommended when a nodule of <1 cm 
has  been  detected.  Computed  tomography  (CT)  and  magnetic  reso-
nance imaging (MRI) are not recommended as screening tools due to 
lack of data on accuracy, high cost, and possible harm (i.e., radiation 
with CT). Exceptionally, these techniques can be considered in patients 
with obesity and fatty liver, where visualization with ultrasound is dif-
ficult. Accurate tumor biomarkers for early detection need to be devel-
oped.  Use  of  AFP  levels  as  a  stand-alone  method  identifies  patients 
with HCC with 60% sensitivity but has high false-positive results. One 
main limitation of AFP is that only a small proportion of early tumors 
(~20%)  present  with  abnormal  AFP  serum  levels.  Combining  AFP 
with  ultrasound  might  increase  the  HCC  detection  rate  from  8–30% 
compared to ultrasound and depending on the performance by experi-
enced personnel as a stand-alone method. The accuracy of other serum 
biomarkers proposed, such as des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) and 
the L3 fraction of AFP (AFP-L3), in early detection is not known.

Despite the fact that surveillance is cost-effective in HCC, the global 
implementation of such programs is estimated to engage ~50% of the 
target  population  in  Europe  and  ~30%  in  the  United  States.  Public 
health  policies  encouraging  the  implementation  of  such  programs 
should lead to an increase in early tumor detection.

Diagnosis  HCC  is  generally  diagnosed  at  early  or  intermediate 
stages in Western countries but at advanced stages in most Asian (except 
Japan) and African countries. A surveillance program yields early diag-
nosis in 70–80% of cases. At these stages, the tumor is asymptomatic, 
and  diagnosis  can  be  made  by  noninvasive  (radiologic)  or  invasive 
(biopsy) approaches. Without surveillance, HCC is discovered either as 
a radiologic finding or due to cancer-related symptoms. If symptoms are 
present, the disease is already at an advanced stage with a median life 
expectancy  <1  year.  Symptoms  include  malaise,  weight  loss,  anorexia, 
abdominal discomfort, or signs related to advanced liver dysfunction.
NONINVASIVE  (RADIOLOGIC)  DIAGNOSIS  Patients  enrolled  in  a  sur-
veillance program are diagnosed by identification of a new liver nodule 
on  abdominal  ultrasound.  Noninvasive  diagnostic  criteria  can  only 
be applied to cirrhotic patients and are based on imaging techniques 
obtained by four-phase multidetector CT scan (four phases are unen-
hanced, arterial, venous, and delayed) or dynamic contrast-enhanced 
MRI. A flowchart of diagnosis and recall policy recommended by U.S. 
and European guidelines is summarized in Fig. 82-2. Radiologic diag-
nosis is achieved with a high degree of confidence if the lesion is ≥1 cm 
in diameter and shows the radiologic hallmarks of HCC by one imaging 
technique.  Using  contrast-enhanced  imaging  techniques,  the  typical 
hallmark of HCC consists of vascular uptake of the nodule in the arte-
rial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases. This 
radiologic pattern captures the hypervascular nature characteristic of

PART 4Oncology and HematologyHCC. In these scenarios, the diagnostic specificity is ~95–100% and a 
biopsy is not necessary. Nodules <1 cm in size are unlikely to be HCC 
and would be very difficult to diagnose; thus, ultrasound follow-up at 
3–4 months is recommended. MRI with liver-specific contrast agents 
is accepted as a diagnostic tool (Fig. 82-2). Contrast-enhanced ultra-
sound and angiography are less accurate for HCC diagnosis. Positron 
emission tomography (PET) scan performs poorly for early diagnosis. 
AFP  levels  ≥400  ng/dL  are  highly  suspicious,  but  not  diagnostic,  of 
HCC according to guidelines.

The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) has been 
proposed  as  a  way  of  classifying  radiologic  findings.  Essentially,  nod-
ules >10 mm visible on multiphase exams are assigned category codes 
reflecting  their  relative  probability  of  being  benign,  HCC,  or  other 
hepatic malignant neoplasms. LI-RADS-1 lesions have a 0% probability 
of HCC, whereas lesions assigned to the LI-RADS-5 category have a 96% 
probability of HCC. LI-RADS-M category comprises lesions with malig-
nant radiologic features but are not HCC malignancies in >50% of cases.
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS  Pathologic diagnosis is required in two sce-
narios: (1) in patients without cirrhosis and (2) if imaging is not typical 
in at least one of two imaging techniques (CT and MRI). This occurs 
mainly with early-stage HCC lesions. Biopsy has not been used as the 
gold  standard  in  clinical  practice  because  of  variation  introduced  by 
sampling and complications. Nonetheless, with the advent of molecular 
therapies and precision oncology, some guidelines advocate obtaining 
tissue  samples  in  the  setting  of  all  research  studies  in  HCC,  even  if 
radiologic criteria are met. Sensitivity of liver biopsies ranges between 
70 and 90% for all tumor sizes but decreases to <50% in tumors 1–2 cm  
in size. The risk of complications such as tumor seeding and bleeding 
after  liver  biopsy  is  ~3%.  Biopsies  should  be  assessed  by  an  expert 

hepatopathologist. The use of special stains may help to resolve diag-
nostic uncertainties. Positive staining in two of four markers (glypican 
3 [GPC3], glutamine synthetase, heat shock protein 70 [HSP70], and 
clathrin heavy chain) is highly specific for HCC. Gene expression blue-
prints (glypican 3, LYVE1, and survivin) are also able to differentiate 
HGDNs  from  early  HCC.  Additional  staining  can  be  considered  to 
detect progenitor cell features (K19 and EpCAM) or assess neovascu-
larization (CD34). A negative biopsy does not eliminate the diagnosis 
of  HCC.  A  second  biopsy  is  recommended  in  case  of  inconclusive 
findings or if growth or change in enhancement pattern is identified 
during follow-up (Fig. 82-2).
 ■ TREATMENT
Overview  The landscape of management of HCC has substantially 
changed during the past decade. Several treatments have been adopted 
as standard of care according to clinical practice guidelines. For early 
stages,  resection,  liver  transplantation,  and  local  ablation  have  sub-
stantially improved life expectancy, with median overall survival (OS) 
times beyond 5 years (Fig. 82-3). For intermediate stages, transarterial 
chemoembolization  (TACE)  has  improved  OS  from  16  months  (nat-
ural  history)  to  20–30  months.  Finally,  systemic  drugs  for  advanced 
tumors  (atezolizumab  plus  bevacizumab,  sorafenib,  lenvatinib,  rego-
rafenib,  cabozantinib,  and  ramucirumab)  have  improved  median 
survival times from 8 months to 19 months in first-line settings and 10 
months in second-line settings. Currently, several unmet needs, such 
as  adjuvant  therapies  after  resection  or  local  ablation  and  improving 
outcomes at intermediate/advanced stages with combination therapies 
including immunotherapies, are being addressed in the setting of phase 
3 investigations (Fig. 82-3).

FIGURE  82-4  Staging  system  and  therapeutic  strategy.  Barcelona  Clinic  Liver  Cancer  (BCLC)  classification  comprises  five  stages  that  select  the  best  candidates  for 
therapies according to evidence-based data. Patients with asymptomatic early tumors (stages 0–A) are candidates for radical therapies (resection, transplantation, or local 
ablation). Asymptomatic patients with multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage B) are suitable for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), whereas 
patients  with  advanced  symptomatic  tumors  and/or  an  invasive  tumoral  pattern  (stage  C)  are  candidates  to  receive  systemic  therapies.  End-stage  disease  (stage  D) 
includes patients with poor prognosis who should be treated by best supportive care. *Patients with end-stage liver disease if Child-Pugh class C should first be considered 
for liver transplantation.  ‡Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab has been approved as new first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Nonetheless, sorafenib and lenvatinib are 
still considered first line options when there is a contraindication for the combination treatment. DDLT, deceased donor liver transplantation; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status; LDLT, living donor liver transplantation; OS, overall survival. (Reproduced with permission from JM Llovet et al: Trial Design and

Staging Systems and Treatment Allocation  Staging systems are 
aimed  at  stratifying  patients  according  to  prognostic  factors  and  out-
come and allocating the best available therapies according to evidence. 
The most accepted staging system is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
(BCLC) Classification, which is endorsed by U.S. and European clinical 
practice  guidelines  (Fig.  82-4).  This  staging  system  defines  five  prog-
nostic  subclasses  and  allocates  specific  treatments  for  each  stage.  The 
BCLC staging system has been externally validated by numerous studies. 
It is an evolving system that allows incorporation of new therapies and 
treatment-dependent variables as new evidence emerges. Ten treatments 
have been shown to improve survival in HCC and thus have been incor-
porated in the therapeutic algorithm: surgical resection, liver transplan-
tation, radiofrequency (RF) ablation, chemoembolization, and systemic 
therapies (atezolizumab-bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, 
cabozantinib,  and  ramucirumab).  The  BCLC  assigns  each  patient  to  a 
given treatment allocation. Treatment stage migration is also applied by 
this scheme, meaning that if patients are not candidates for the selected 
therapy, the next effective therapy at more advanced stages can be given.
In HCC, three parameters are relevant for defining treatment strat-
egy: tumor status, cancer-related symptoms, and liver dysfunction. The 
BCLC staging captures all three variables and allocates patients to treat-
ments according to evidence. Since >80% of patients have two diseases, 
HCC and cirrhosis, a clear measurement of liver dysfunction should be 
in place. The prognosis of chronic liver disease is commonly assessed 
using  the  Child-Pugh  score,  which  uses  five  clinical  measures—total 
bilirubin,  serum  albumin,  prothrombin  time,  ascites  severity,  and 
hepatic  encephalopathy  grade—to  classify  patients  into  one  of  three 
groups  (A–C)  of  predicted  survival  rates.  In  brief,  Child-Pugh  class 
A  reflects  well-preserved  liver  function,  Child-Pugh  class  B  indicates 
moderate liver dysfunction with a median life expectancy of ~3 years, 
and  Child-Pugh  class  C  indicates  severe  liver  dysfunction  with  life 

expectancy of ~1 year. At early BCLC stages, more granular criteria to 
define  patients  with  very-well-preserved  liver  function  (Child-Pugh 
hyper-A class; those patients with normal bilirubin and without portal 
hypertension)  need  to  be  in  place  to  select  candidates  for  resection. 
Modifications of Child-Pugh scoring or the Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) score have not been adopted for treatment allocation, 
except  for  prioritization  on  the  waiting  list  for  liver  transplantation 
(MELD score). The ALBI score, which is based only on serum albumin 
and bilirubin levels, has been shown to accurately stratify patients with 
HCC, particularly those with less severe liver dysfunction. Performance 
status  is  assessed  using  the  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group 
(ECOG)  performance  scale  (a  5-point  system  where  higher  numbers 
indicate  greater  disability),  and  the  presence  of  cancer-related  symp-
toms (ECOG 1–2) is considered a sign of advanced stage. Patients with 
severe  liver  dysfunction  (Child-Pugh  class  C)  or  performance  status 
impairment (ECOG 3–4) are offered supportive care management.

Considering  all  of  these  prognostic  and  predictive  variables  and 
evidence-based treatment efficacy, five BCLC stages have been defined 
(Fig.  82-4).  Patients  with  liver-only  neoplastic  disease,  no  symptoms 
(ECOG 0), and mild to moderate liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh A-B) 
can be classified as very early (stage 0) or early (stage A) or intermedi-
ate (stage B) stages depending on tumor size and number. Very early 
HCC  (BCLC  0)  is  defined  by  single  tumors  ≤2  cm  (if  pathology  is 
available, they should be well differentiated with absence of microvas-
cular  invasion  or  satellites).  Early  HCC  (BCLC  A)  includes  either 
single tumors or a maximum of three nodules of ≤3 cm in diameter. 
Intermediate stage (BCLC B) is defined by all other liver-only tumors. 
Conversely,  HCC  is  considered  at  advanced  stages  (BCLC  C)  when 
patients present with cancer-related symptoms (ECOG 1–2) or tumors 
with macrovascular invasion (of any type, including branch, hepatic, or 
portal vein), lymph node involvement, or extrahepatic spread. Finally,

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyend-stage disease (BCLC D) is considered in cases of several impair-
ment of quality of life/cancer-related symptoms (ECOG 3–4) or severe 
liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh C).

Around 40% of patients are diagnosed at stages 0 and A and, hence, 
are eligible for potentially curative therapies, resection, transplantation, 
or  local  ablation.  These  treatments  provide  median  survival  rates  of 
60 months and beyond, which are in sharp contrast with outcomes of 
36 months reported in historical controls (Fig. 82-3, Table 82-2). No 
adjuvant therapy is recommended. Patients at intermediate stage (stage 
B) with preserved liver function have a documented natural history of 
around 16 months. These patients benefit from TACE as reported in 
two  randomized  studies  and  one  meta-analysis  and  achieve  an  esti-
mated survival of 25–30 months. None of the combination therapies 
with TACE have shown outcome advantages. Patients progressing on 
TACE or at advanced stage (stage C) benefit from systemic treatments. 
Sorafenib extends survival by ~3 months compared to placebo (from 
7.9  to  10.7  months),  whereas  lenvatinib  showed  noninferiority  com-
pared to sorafenib (13.6 months vs 12.3 months, respectively). Atezoli-
zumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody) plus bevacizumab showed superiority 
compared to sorafenib (median survival 19.2 months vs 13.4 months). 
Three  additional  targeted  therapies  have  shown  improved  survival 
compared to placebo in patients with HCC progressing on sorafenib: 
regorafenib,  cabozantinib,  and  ramucirumab  (only  in  patients  with 
AFP >400 ng/mL). Therefore, these treatments have been adopted by 
guidelines  and  incorporated  into  the  treatment  algorithm.  Patients 
with end-stage disease (BCLC D) should be considered for nutritional 
and psychological support and proper management of pain.

Although  the  BCLC  establishes  validated  stages  and  treatment 
assignment  according  to  evidence,  clinical  practice  is  not  always 
aligned with this classification. In large cohort studies and surveys, only 
half of patients, or even less in Asia, are treated accordingly. Alternative 

649

staging or scoring systems have been proposed, but none of them has 
acquired global consensus. In contrast to BCLC, some proposed sys-
tems capture the standard of practice in Asia, such as the Hong Kong 
classification  or  the  Japan  Integrated  Staging  score.  These  systems 
capture extended indications for resection and TACE applied in clinical 
practice  in  Asia.  Finally,  the  tumor-node-metastasis  (TNM)  staging 
system  is  not  used  in  HCC  since  it  does  not  incorporate  the  main 
prognostic variables related to liver function and performance status.

Due  to  the  complexities  of  HCC  diagnosis  and  management,  it 
is  recommended  that  patients  be  sent  to  a  referral  center  where  all 
the  armamentarium  of  therapies  can  be  offered.  In  principle,  patient 
management and outcome benefit from liver cancer multidisciplinary 
programs  that  include  a  hepatologist,  oncologist,  hepatobiliary  and 
transplant  surgeons,  interventional  and  body  imaging  radiologist, 
hepatopathologist, and specialized nurses.

 ■ SURGICAL THERAPIES
Resection  Surgical resection is the first-line option for noncirrhotic 
patients  with  early-stage  HCC  (BCLC  0  or  A)  with  solitary  tumors  
(Fig.  82-4).  In  cirrhotic  patients,  ablation  competes  with  resection 
for  BCLC  0  tumors  (<2  cm  in  diameter).  Which  treatment  is  better 
is  not  defined.  Cost-effectiveness  approaches  report  a  benefit  for 
local  ablation  with  RF.  For  single  tumors  >2  cm  (BCLC  A),  resec-
tion  remains  the  mainstay  of  treatment  in  patients  with  Child-Pugh 
hyper-A class, i.e., those patients with normal bilirubin and absence of 
portal hypertension (portal hypertension is defined by hepatic venous 
pressure  gradient  ≥10  mmHg).  Surrogate  measures  of  portal  hyper-
tension are presence of esophageal varices or platelet count <100,000/
μL  associated  with  splenomegaly.  Anatomic  resections  following  the 
functional segments of the liver are recommended to spare uninvolved

liver parenchyma and to remove satellite tumors. Predictors of recur-
rence  are  tumor  size  and  number  and  presence  of  microsatellites  or 
microvascular invasion at the specimen analysis. Outcomes in subop-
timal candidates lead to 5-year survival rates of ~35–55%, as opposed 
to 60–70% for ideal candidates (Table 82-2). Macrovascular invasion, 
extrahepatic involvement, and liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh B-C) are 
major contraindications for resection.
ADJUVANT  TREATMENTS  Tumor  recurrence  represents  the  major 
complication  of  resection  (and  local  ablation)  and  occurs  in  70%  of 
cases at 5 years. Most recurrences are intrahepatic metastases, but at 
least one-third are considered de novo tumors, new clones developing 
in the cirrhotic carcinogenic field. The type of recurrence can only be 
defined by molecular studies. So far, no adjuvant therapies have been 
proven  to  improve  outcome  or  prevent  recurrence  after  resection/
ablation. Randomized trials testing adjuvant sorafenib, retinoids, che-
motherapies, or chemoembolization have been negative, and thus, no 
adjuvant  therapy  recommendation  has  been  established  for  patients 
after resection or local ablation.

Liver Transplantation  Liver transplantation is the first treatment 
choice  for  cirrhotic  patients  with  single  tumors  ≤5  cm  and  portal 
hypertension  (including  Child-Pugh  B  and  C)  or  with  small  multi-
nodular tumors (≤3 nodules, each ≤3 cm) (Fig. 82-4). These so-called 
Milan criteria have been validated over the years, and a meta-analysis 
reported 5- and 10-year survival rates of ~70 and ~50%, respectively, 
similar to outcomes achieved in non-HCC transplantation indications. 
Perioperative  mortality  rates  have  been  reduced  to  <3%.  Transplan-
tation  simultaneously  cures  the  tumor  and  the  underlying  cirrhosis, 
and it is associated with a low risk of recurrence, around 10–15% at 5 
years.  No  immunosuppressive  regimens  or  antitumor  therapies  after 
transplantation have demonstrated any preventive effect on recurrence. 
Milan criteria are integrated in the treatment strategy (BCLC 0 and A) 
and have also been adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing 
(UNOS) pretransplant staging for organ allocation in the United States 
(stage  T2).  Aside  from  size  and  number,  conventional  contraindica-
tions for organ transplantation procedures (e.g., ABO incompatibility, 
comorbidities) are applied in this setting.

Liver transplantation has a couple of factors, such as cost and donor 
availability, that limit this procedure to <5% of HCC cases. The scarcity 
of donors represents a major drawback of liver transplantation. Donor 
scarcity varies geographically, and deceased liver donation is almost zero 
in some Asian countries. Due to the shortage of donors, median waiting 
times in Western programs is ~6–12 months, leading to 20% of candi-
dates  dropping  off  the  list  due  to  tumor  progression  before  receiving 
the procedure. Predictors of dropout are neoadjuvant treatment failure, 
baseline  AFP  >400  ng/mL,  and  steady  increase  of  AFP  level  >15  ng/
mL per month. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome this 
limitation. First, apply neoadjuvant therapies in patients on the waiting 
list.  Neoadjuvant  treatments  such  as  TACE  or  RF  ablation  have  been 
assessed in the setting of cohort and cost-effectiveness studies. In prin-
ciple, the use of these therapies is recommended when the waiting time 
exceeds 6 months, even though impact on long-term outcome is uncer-
tain. Second, a priority policy has been established for patients enlisted. 
UNOS has implemented a scoring system based on the dropout risk.

The  Milan  criteria  are  universally  used  as  the  basis  for  transplant 
eligibility,  and  adherence  to  these  criteria  yields  good  posttransplant 
survival.  Modest  expansion  of  Milan  criteria  applying  the  “up-to-
seven” criterion (i.e., those HCCs having the number 7 as the sum of 
the  size  of  the  largest  tumor  and  the  number  of  tumors)  in  patients 
without microvascular invasion achieves competitive outcomes. These 
pathologically defined criteria are being used in clinical practice to pre-
dict the expected outcome after transplantation. Similarly, downstaging 
to Milan criteria is currently defined as the reduction of HCC burden 
by locoregional treatments to achieve Milan staging before transplan-
tation. This strategy leads to long-term 10-year survival rates of ~50%. 
Since  policies  for  enhancing  organ  donation  have  reached  a  ceiling 
during  the  past  several  years,  alternatives  to  donation  have  emerged. 
Living  donor  liver  transplantation  represents  a  plausible  alternative 
that  accounts  of  ~5%  of  total  transplantations  performed  globally. 

Outcomes reported are similar to those with deceased liver donors, and 
it is recommended as an alternative option in patients on a waiting list 
exceeding 6 months. The risks and benefits of this procedure should 
take into account both donor (death is estimated in 0.3%) and recipi-
ent, a concept known as double equipoise. Due to the complexity of this 
treatment, it must be restricted to centers of excellence in hepatobiliary 
surgery and transplantation.
 ■ LOCOREGIONAL THERAPIES
LOCAL  ABLATION  RF  ablation  is  recommended  as  the  primary 
ablative  technique  (Fig.  82-4).  The  energy  generated  by  RF  ablation 
(heating  of  tissue  at  80°–100°C)  induces  coagulative  necrosis  of  the 
tumor, producing a safety ring in the peritumoral tissue, which might 
eliminate  small  undetected  satellites.  Treatment  consists  of  one  or 
two  sessions  performed  using  a  percutaneous  approach,  although  in 
some  instances,  ablation  with  laparoscopy  is  needed.  RF  ablation  is 
more effective in response rate and time to recurrence compared with 
the  once-conventional  percutaneous  ethanol  injection.  HCC  patients 
treated by RF ablation have 5-year survival rates of ~60% (Table 82-2). 
In tumors <2 cm, RF ablation achieves complete responses in >90% of 
cases with good long-term outcome and is competitive with resection 
in cost-effectiveness as first-line option. For BCLC A cases, RF ablation 
is the first-line treatment for single tumors 2–5 cm or up to three nod-
ules, each ≤3 cm in diameter, unsuitable for surgery.

The failure rate of RF ablation increases in tumors >3 cm because of 
the heat loss due to perfusion-mediated tissue cooling within the area 
ablated.  In  tumors  3–5  cm  in  diameter,  complete  pathologic  tumor 
necrosis of <50% has been reported. In particular, ~10–15% of tumors 
with  difficult-to-treat  locations,  such  as  a  subcapsular  location  or 
adjacent to the gallbladder, have a higher risk of incomplete ablation 
or  major  complications  and  can  be  approached  by  ethanol  injection. 
Several  approaches  have  been  proposed  to  enhance  the  antitumor 
activity  of  RF  ablation.  Microwave  ablation  is  the  most  widely  used 
local  image-guided  technique  alternative  to  RF.  Theoretically,  it  pro-
vides  major  efficacy  but  higher  complication  rates  in  tumors  >3  cm. 
Randomized trials comparing both techniques are needed. Other treat-
ments, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound or stereotactic body 
radiotherapy for small tumors, have been studied in early clinical trials 
and are under investigation.

Chemoembolization  TACE  is  the  most  widely  used  primary 
treatment  for  unresectable  HCC  worldwide  and  the  first-line  indica-
tion for patients with intermediate BCLC B stage (Fig. 82-4). Conven-
tional chemoembolization (c-TACE) consists of the local hepatic artery 
administration  of  chemotherapy  (either  doxorubicin  50  mg/m2  or 
cisplatin) mixed with an emulsion of lipiodol followed by obstruction 
of  the  feeding  artery  with  sponge  particles.  c-TACE  mainly  benefits 
patients with liver-only disease, Child-Pugh A class or B class without 
ascites,  good  performance  status  (ECOG  0),  and  absence  of  branch 
or  trunk  vascular  invasion.  Median  survival  is  ~20  months  (com-
pared  to  16  months  for  pooled  control  arms).  The  best  randomized 
phase  3  investigations  have  provided  median  survivals  for  TACE  of  
20–30  months  in  properly  selected  populations.  Median  objective 
response  rates  are  50–70%.  In  randomized  studies,  the  treatment  is 
either performed at a regular schedule of 0, 2, and 6 months (median 
number  of  sessions:  3)  or  on  demand  according  to  tumor  response. 
TACE  procedures  should  be  stopped  upon  tumor  progression  or 
any other contraindication. Exceptionally, occurrence of a new small 
untreated  nodule  as  the  only  progression  feature  can  be  considered 
for treatment. Around 50% of patients present with a limited postem-
bolization syndrome of fever and abdominal pain related to ischemic 
injury and release of cytokines. Less than 5% of patients present with 
major complications (liver abscess, ischemic cholecystitis, or liver fail-
ure), and in <2% of cases, treatment-related death occurs.

Applicability of c-TACE in patients at intermediate stage is limited 
to half of cases, mostly as a result of the presence of liver failure (Child 
B or ascites or encephalopathy), technical contraindications to the pro-
cedure  (i.e.,  impaired  portal  vein  blood  flow),  or  infiltrative/massive 
tumor burden (i.e., generally main tumor size >10 cm). Super-selective

PART 4Oncology and HematologyTACE  minimize  the  ischemic  insult  to  nontumor  tissue.  According 
to guidelines, treatment-stage migration allows performing TACE on 
patients at early stages not suitable for surgical or ablative therapies. In 
selective studies, median survival times of 5 years have been reported 
in patients with single HCC treated by super-selective TACE. On the 
other  hand,  TACE  performed  beyond  guidelines  as  a  conventional 
practice in patients with advanced HCC yields poor outcomes.

Drug-eluting  bead  chemoembolization  (DEB-TACE)  differs  from 
c-TACE  in  the  use  of  more  standardized  embolic  spheres  of  regular 
size embedded with chemotherapy. This strategy ensures drug release 
over a 1-week period, resulting in an enhancement of drug concentra-
tion within the tumor. DEB-TACE achieves similar antitumor activity 
(objective responses of ~60%) as c-TACE and is associated with signifi-
cantly less systemic cytotoxic effects and better tolerance, but with no 
clear differences in clinical outcomes. Phase 2 and 3 studies have com-
pared DEB-TACE with the combination of DEB-TACE plus sorafenib, 
orantinib,  or  brivanib,  which  are  VEGF  receptor  inhibitors.  Median 
survival in both arms of these international trials was 25–30 months.
Radioembolization  and  Other  Intraarterial  Therapies  
Radioembolization using beads coated with yttrium-90 (Y-90)—an iso-
tope that emits short-range β radiation—is the most promising alterna-
tive to TACE. Several phase II studies reported objective responses and 
overall outcome with a safe profile. Due to the lack of phase III trials, 
this treatment is currently not recommended in guidelines. Radioem-
bolization  requires  prevention  of  severe  lung  shunting  and  intestinal 
radiation before the procedure. Around 20% of patients present with 
liver-related toxicity and 3% experience treatment-related death. Due 
to the minimally embolic effect of Y-90 microspheres, treatment can be 

651

safely used in patients with portal vein thrombosis, a setting where sur-
vival results in phase II were encouraging. However, three randomised 
controlled  trials,  including  two  head-to-head  trials  against  sorafenib 
and  one  trial  combining  radioembolization  plus  sorafenib  versus 
sorafenib  alone,  did  not  show  OS  endpoint  superiority.  Thus,  these 
treatments are not indicated in the advanced-stage scenario.

TACE  should  be  distinguished  from  other  intraarterial  therapies, 
such  as  chemo-lipiodolization,  which  involves  the  delivery  of  an 
emulsion  of  chemotherapy  mixed  with  lipiodol;  bland  transcatheter 
embolization,  where  no  chemotherapeutic  agent  is  delivered;  and 
intraarterial chemotherapy, where no embolization is performed. None 
of these approaches is recommended due to the lack of survival benefit.

 ■ SYSTEMIC THERAPIES
Conventional systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not pro-
duced  survival  advantages.  Randomized  studies  also  failed  to  show 
benefit with antiestrogen therapies and vitamin D derivatives. External- 
beam  liver-directed  radiotherapy  (stereotactic  body  radiotherapy) 
efficacy is currently being tested with and without sorafenib in phase 
III  trials.  In  2007,  a  phase  III  trial  demonstrated  survival  benefits 
for  patients  with  advanced-stage  disease  treated  with  sorafenib,  and 
lenvatinib  showed  similar  effects  to  sorafenib  in  first-line  treatment. 
Recently, the combination of atezolizumab with bevacizumab demon-
strated  survival  benefits  in  the  advanced  setting  when  compared  to 
sorafenib and has now become the standard first-line treatment. Three 
additional  therapies,  regorafenib,  cabozantinib,  and  ramucirumab 
(only in patients with AFP >400 ng/mL), have been shown to benefit 
patients progressing on sorafenib (Fig. 82-5).

652 Molecular  Targeted  Therapies  Atezolizumab  (anti-PD-L1 
checkpoint  inhibitor)  plus  bevacizumab  (antibody  against  VEGFA) 
has  become  the  standard  of  care  in  first-line  treatment  for  advanced 
HCC as a result of a positive phase 3 trial indicating superiority ver-
sus  sorafenib  in  terms  of  survival  (Fig.  82-5).  Median  survival  with 
the  combination  was  19.2  months  compared  with  13.4  months  for 
sorafenib. Combination treatment also improved progression-free sur-
vival and patient-reported quality of life outcomes. Objective response 
to  the  combination  was  35.4%  versus  13.9%  for  sorafenib.  Adverse 
events  also  favored  the  combination  (grade  3–4  adverse  events,  36% 
vs 50% for sorafenib). The most common side effects associated with 
the combination were hypertension, proteinuria, and low-grade diar-
rhea, whereas autoimmune events were infrequent. Treatment-related 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of these two drugs was 15%. 
Upper  gastrointestinal  endoscopies  are  required  before  initiating  the 
combination therapy for detection and treatment of varices to mitigate 
the  risk  of  bleeding  associated  with  bevacizumab.  Thus,  screening 
for  varices  is  becoming  standard  before  first-line  therapy  in  HCC 
management.

Alternatively,  sorafenib  and  lenvatinib  are  indicated  for  HCC  in 
patients  with  well-preserved  liver  function  (Child-Pugh  class  A)  and 
with  advanced  tumors  either  as  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with 
contraindications  or  with  progression  to  the  combination  therapy  

(Fig.  82-5).  A  phase  III  study  comparing  sorafenib  versus  placebo 
showed  increased  survival  from  7.9  months  to  10.7  months  (hazard 
ratio [HR] 0.69; 31% reduction in risk of death). Patients with HCV- 
related HCC achieve significantly better outcomes with sorafenib, with 
a median survival of 14 months. No predictive biomarkers of respon-
siveness  to  sorafenib  have  been  identified.  The  recommended  daily 
dose  of  sorafenib  is  800  mg.  Median  treatment  duration  is  about  6 
months. Treatment is associated with adverse events, such as diarrhea, 
hand-foot  skin  reactions,  fatigue,  and  hypertension.  These  toxicities 
lead to treatment discontinuation in 15% of patients and dose reduc-
tion  in  up  to  half.  This  therapy  cannot  be  administered  to  around 
one-third of the targeted patients due to primary intolerance, advanced 
age, or liver failure (ascites or encephalopathy). Active vascular disease, 
either coronary or peripheral, is considered a formal contraindication.
The efficacy of sorafenib probably results from a balance between 
targeting cancer cells and the microenvironment by blocking up to 40 
kinases, including antiangiogenic (VEGF receptor [VEGFR], platelet- 
derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]) and antiproliferative drivers 
(serine/threonine-protein  kinase  B-raf  [BRAF]  and  mast/stem  cell 
growth factor receptor [c-Kit]) (Fig. 82-6). Median time to progression 
on sorafenib is 4–5 months in phase III trials.

Another  alternative  to  sorafenib  is  the  multikinase  inhibitor  len-
vatinib; it was noninferior in a phase 3 investigation (13.6 months vs

responses in 24% of cases. The main side effects are hypertension, pro-
teinuria,  asthenia,  diarrhea,  and  weight  loss.  This  treatment  induced 
grade 3–4 drug-related adverse events in 55% of patients, resulting in a 
withdrawal rate of ~15%.

Three  drugs  (regorafenib,  cabozantinib,  and  ramucirumab)  have 
shown  survival  benefits  versus  placebo  in  patients  progressing  on 
sorafenib,  and  two  additional  immune-based  treatments  have  been 
approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  based 
on promising phase 2 data (pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus ipil-
imumab) (Fig. 82-5). The median survival of patients progressing on 
first-line  treatment  is  8  months  (obtained  from  patients  allocated  to 
the placebo arm).

A  phase  III  study  comparing  regorafenib  (a  more  potent  multiki-
nase inhibitor than sorafenib targeting similar kinases) versus placebo 
in  patients  progressing  on  sorafenib  reported  a  benefit  in  survival 
from  7.8  to  10.6  months  (HR  0.62;  38%  reduction  in  risk  of  death)  
(Fig.  82-5).  Response  rate  was  10%.  Median  time  on  treatment  was  
3.5  months.  Prevalence  of  toxicity  (hand-foot  reaction,  fatigue,  and 
hypertension)  was  higher  compared  with  reported  toxicity  from 
sorafenib,  but  adverse  events  only  led  to  treatment  discontinuation 
in  10%  of  cases.  Cabozantinib,  a  multikinase  VEGFR  inhibitor  with 
activity  against  both  AXL  and  c-MET  (Fig.  82-6),  improves  survival 
compared to placebo after progression on sorafenib (10.2 months for 
cabozantinib  vs  8.0  months  in  the  placebo  arm;  HR  0.76).  The  most 
common  grade  3–4  adverse  events  were  palmar-plantar  erythrody-
sesthesia,  hypertension,  increased  aspartate  aminotransferase  level, 
fatigue,  and  diarrhea.  Ramucirumab,  an  anti-VEGFR-2  monoclonal 
antibody, is the only biomarker-guided therapy in HCC based on AFP 
levels. The randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 REACH-2 study 
selected patients with advanced HCC in second line with baseline AFP 
≥400  ng/dL.  Median  survival  for  patients  treated  with  ramucirumab 
was 8.1 months, compared to 5 months for patients receiving placebo. 
The  most  common  grade  3–4  adverse  events  were  hypertension, 
hyponatremia,  and  increased  aspartate  aminotransferase.  Patients 
progressing after second-line therapy and patients with BCLC D stage 
should receive best supportive palliative care, including management of 
pain, nutrition, and psychological support.

Mass-forming

Immunotherapy  and  Combinations  The  combination  of  the 
anti-PD-L1  antibody  atezolizumab  with  the  VEGFA  inhibitor  bev-
acizumab  is  the  first  regimen  to  improve  survival  in  the  first-line 
setting  compared  to  sorafenib.  In  addition, 
two  additional  treatment  regimens  involv-
ing  immunotherapies  have  been  approved 
by  the  FDA  as  second-line  therapies  based 
on  phase  2  data.  Single-agent  checkpoint 
inhibitor  treatments,  such  as  nivolumab 
and  pembrolizumab,  are  associated  with 
objective  responses  of  15–20%,  which  are 
durable in time, generally beyond 12 months. 
Less  than  30%  of  patients  experience  grade 
3–4  treatment-related  adverse  events.  Nei-
ther  regimen  hit  the  primary  endpoint  of 
improved  survival  in  phase  3  investigations 
compared with sorafenib (nivolumab) or pla-
cebo (pembrolizumab). The median survival 
for  nivolumab  of  16.4  months  in  first-line 
treatment  was  not  superior  to  the  survival 
time of 14.7 months for sorafenib. Similarly, 
in  the  second-line  setting,  the  median  sur-
vival for pembrolizumab of 13.9 months was 
not  superior  to  the  median  survival  of  10.6 
months for placebo. Emerging regimens have 
shown signals of efficacy, such as lenvatinib 
plus  pembrolizumab  in  first-line  patients 
with advanced HCC and the combination of 
an anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1 
(nivolumab) in second-line patients.

CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is classified according to its anatomic loca-
tion  as  intrahepatic  (iCCA;  ~20–30%),  perihilar  (pCCA;  ~50–60%),  
and distal (dCCA; ~20–30%). The latter two are also known as extra-
hepatic  cholangiocarcinomas  (eCCAs),  with  the  second-order  bile 
ducts acting as the separation point (Fig. 82-7). This classification is 
endorsed  by  the  eighth  edition  of  the  American  Joint  Committee  on 
Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual. In addition, iCCA has been recognized 
as  a  distinct  entity  with  specific  ad  hoc  clinical  practice  guidelines. 
Treatment  options  beyond  surgery  are  limited,  and  few  molecular 
targeted therapies have been approved for its treatment. The three sub-
types of CCA differ in their anatomic location, epidemiology and risk 
factors,  cell  of  origin,  pathogenesis,  and  treatment.  iCCA  originates 
from  adult  cholangiocytes,  trans-differentiation  of  adult  hepatocytes, 
and  hepatic  progenitor  cells  (cholangiocyte  precursors)  (Fig.  82-8), 
as  opposed  to  HCC,  which  originates  only  from  hepatic  progenitor 
cells or adult hepatocytes. Mixed HCC-iCCA originates from hepatic 
progenitor  cells,  whereas  eCCA  arises  from  the  biliary  epithelium 
and peribiliary glands. Moreover, their mutational profiles also differ. 
FGFR2 fusions and IDH1/2 mutations mostly occur in iCCA, whereas 
ERBB2/3 amplifications and SMAD4 aberrations are characteristic of 
eCCA. Thus, clinical management and trials testing molecular thera-
pies should be tailored according to each biological/anatomical subtype 
of CCA, as opposed to a common approach for all biliary tract cancers.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY, RISK FACTORS, AND 
MOLECULAR TRAITS
CCA is the second most common liver cancer after HCC, with a 5-year 
survival of 10%. iCCA has globally increasing incidence and mortality 
rates.  The  incidence  of  iCCA  varies  according  to  exposure  to  risk 
factors, ranging from 1–2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe and 
North  America  to  the  highest  incidence  in  some  areas  of  Southeast 
Asia, particularly in Thailand (>80 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The 
male-to-female ratio is 1.2. Overall, most cases occur with unknown 
risk  factors.  The  classical  risk  factors  for  CCA  development  include 
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary duct cysts, hepatolithiasis, 
and Caroli’s disease (congenital cystic dilation of the intrahepatic bil-
iary tree). Parasitic biliary infestation with flukes (i.e., most common is 
Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis) is a prevalent etiology in 
Asia that can be prevented with the antihelminth therapy praziquantel. 
PSC  is  a  clear  risk  factor  for  iCCA  and  pCCA  development,  with  a

FIGURE 82-8  Cell of origin of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) can develop from the neoplastic transformation 
of  mature  hepatocytes  and  cholangiocytes,  respectively.  There  is  evidence  showing  that  hepatic  progenitor  cells  (HPCs),  their  intermediate  states,  or  de-differentiated 
hepatocytes can originate liver cancers with progenitor-like features, including mixed HCC-iCCA (e.g., cholangiocellular carcinoma [CLC]). Mature hepatocytes can be also 
reprogrammed into cells that closely resemble biliary epithelial cells and induce the onset of iCCA. (Printed with permission from ©Mount Sinai Health System.)

lifetime incidence ranging from 5 to 10%. Surveillance in PSC patients 
is recommended with annual imaging techniques and CA 19-9 serum 
determination. Common risk factors for HCC, such as HBV and HCV 
infection and cirrhosis, have been associated with iCCA development. 
Sweetened  beverages  were  reported  to  constitute  an  additional  risk 
factor  in  the  development  of  eCCA  and  gallbladder  carcinoma  in  a 
population cohort study.

Molecular  Classification  and  Drivers  No  molecular  clas-
sification  of  CCA  has  been  established.  Genomic  studies  have 
provided insight on two subclasses of iCCA, a proliferation subclass— 
characterized  by  activation  of  oncogenic  signaling  pathways  (includ-
ing  RAS  and  MET)—and  an  inflammation  subclass,  characterized 
by activation of inflammatory pathways, overexpression of cytokines, 
and  STAT3  activation.  Similarly,  a  molecular  classification  of  eCCA 
has  been  proposed,  dividing  tumors  into  four  categories  (metabolic, 
proliferation, mesenchymal, and immune) based on molecular traits. 
The hypothesis that the proliferation class with enrichment of ERBB2/3 
mutations might respond to monoclonal antibodies against this recep-
tor and the immune class might respond to checkpoint inhibitors has 
not  been  tested  or  confirmed.  The  iCCA  mutation  portrait  is  char-
acterized by ~50–60% of tumors having at least one targetable driver 
including  FGFR2  fusion  events  (~25%);  mutations  in  IDH1/2  (15%), 
KRAS  (15%),  BRAF  (5%),  and  EGFR  (3%);  and  amplifications  in 
FGF19/CCDN1 (4%). Although mutations in TP53 (~30%) and KRAS 
(~25%)  are  more  common  in  eCCA  than  in  iCCA,  some  molecular 
drivers are specific for subtypes, such as fusion of PRKACA or PRKACB 
for eCCA or ERBB2 amplifications (~20%) for gallbladder cancer. Liver 
fluke–associated CCAs have a higher incidence of TP53 and SMAD4 
mutations. Host genetic polymorphisms predisposing to CCA have not 
been established.

 ■ INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA
Diagnosis  Diagnosis  of  iCCA  requires  pathologic  confirmation. 
Guidelines  currently  do  not  recommend  surveillance  for  early  diag-
nosis  because  at-risk  populations  are  ill-defined.  Cirrhotic  patients 
at  risk  of  HCC  development  are  enrolled  in  surveillance  programs 
and  can  benefit  from  early  detection  of  iCCA.  Otherwise,  incidental 
diagnosis  occurs  due  to  cross-sectional  imaging  performed  for  other 
reasons.  In  most  cases,  iCCA  is  diagnosed  at  advanced  stages  where 
symptoms  such  as  weight  loss,  malaise,  abdominal  discomfort,  or 
jaundice  are  present.  Pathologic  diagnosis  of  iCCA  is  based  on  the 
World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  criteria.  Differential  diagnosis 
should  be  established  with  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  and  mixed 
iCCA-HCC tumors, which may require evaluation of markers such as 
Hep-Par-1,  GPC3,  HSP70,  and  glutamine  synthetase  markers.  Imag-
ing  studies  with  CT/MRI  are  not  accurate  enough  to  establish  iCCA 
noninvasive  diagnosis.  Dynamic  CT  scanning  characterizes  80%  of 
iCCAs as liver mass-forming tumors with progressive contrast uptake 
from  the  arterial  to  the  venous/delayed  phase.  MRI  dynamic  images 
also  show  peripheral  enhancement  in  the  arterial  phase  followed  by 
progressive  filling  in  of  the  tumor.  Atypical  radiologic  behavior  with 
arterial enhancement recapitulating HCC occurs in 10% of cases. MRI 
with cholangiopancreatography is useful to visualize the ductal system 
and vascular structures. Guidelines do not recommend PET scan for 
diagnosis. Tumor biomarker CA 19-9 at a cutoff level of 100 U/mL has 
prognostic significance but lacks accuracy (sensitivity and specificity of 
~60%) for early diagnosis.

Radiologic  criteria  are  inadequate  for  iCCA  diagnosis  in  cirrhotic 
patients. However, in noncirrhotic patients, guidelines endorse a pre-
sumed diagnosis of iCCA (i.e., venous phase contrast enhancement on 
dynamic  CT/MRI)  if  resection  is  considered.  Assessment  of  disease

extent (venous or arterial invasion and extrahepatic disease) and resec-
tability  is  best  accomplished  with  CT  and/or  MRI  studies.  Doppler 
ultrasound  is  accurate  in  defining  vascular  invasion.  Before  surgery, 
PET  scanning  may  be  considered  to  rule  out  an  occult  primary  or 
metastatic site.

Staging  System  The  staging  system  for  iCCA  resected  cases  is 
based  on  the  TNM  staging  as  per  the  eighth  edition  of  the  AJCC/
International  Union  Against  Cancer  (UICC)  staging.  T1  tumors  are 
solitary without vascular invasion and can be divided into T1a or T1b if 
tumor size is ≤5 cm or >5 cm, respectively; T2 disease includes multiple 
tumors  (e.g.,  multifocal  disease,  satellitosis,  intrahepatic  metastasis) 
or  presence  of  vascular  invasion  (microvascular  or  major  vascular 
invasion); T3 tumors perforate the visceral peritoneum; and T4 disease 
includes tumors involving local extrahepatic structures by direct inva-
sion. Regional lymph node metastasis in the hilar, periduodenal, and 
peripancreatic nodes is considered N1 disease, while distant spread is 
considered M1 disease. TNM stages IA, IB, II, and IIIA overlap with T 
status, whereas stage IIIB includes T4N0 or N1M0 disease and stage IV 
includes M1 disease.

 ■ TREATMENT
After adopting the TNM staging system, the International Liver Can-
cer Association (ILCA) guidelines for management of iCCA proposed 
a  treatment  algorithm  (Fig.  82-9),  adapted  and  updated  with  the 
new  treatment  modalities  accepted.  Overall,  most  of  the  treatments 
endorsed  have  a  modest  level  of  evidence.  Surgical  resection  rep-
resents the sole curative treatment option in 30–40% of patients, with 

a  median  survival  of  51  months  in  properly  selected  candidates.  In 
noncirrhotic individuals, the best candidates for resection are patients 
at  TNM  stage  I–II,  whereas  in  patients  with  cirrhosis,  liver  function 
should  be  assessed  as  previously  described  for  HCC.  Preoperative 
disease  assessment  should  discard  vascular  invasion,  N1,  and  M1. 
Lymphadenectomy of regional nodes is recommended given its prog-
nostic value. The main predictors of recurrence (~50–60% at 3 years) 
and  survival  are  identified  at  the  pathologic  examination,  including 
presence of vascular invasion, lymph node metastases, and poor differ-
entiation. A phase 3 trial (BILCAP trial) including all types of CCA in 
a  prespecified  per-protocol  analysis  reported  improved  survival  with 
adjuvant therapy (53 months vs 36 months; adjusted HR 0.75). Based 
on this trial, American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recom-
mend adjuvant capecitabine for a period of 6 months. Other adjuvant 
regimens,  such  as  gemcitabine  monotherapy  or  a  combination  of 
gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, did not improve OS. Liver transplantation 
remains  controversial,  and  few  studies  have  reported  good  outcomes 
for single tumors ≤2 cm.

Nonsurgical  candidates  have  a  dismal  life  expectancy.  Overall, 
patients  at  stage  III  might  be  considered  for  locoregional  therapies, 
such as chemoembolization or radioembolization, but the level of evi-
dence is low and is mostly based on cohort studies. A meta-analysis of 
14 trials testing locoregional therapies reported median survival times 
of  15  months.  External-beam  radiation  therapy  is  not  recommended 
as  standard  therapy.  At  more  advanced  stages  (stage  IV)  in  patients 
with  an  ECOG  of  0–1,  systemic  chemotherapy  with  the  combination 
of  gemcitabine  and  cisplatin  is  considered  the  standard  of  practice, 
yielding median survival times of 11.7 months compared to 8 months

for gemcitabine alone. This recommendation for first-line treatment of 
advanced tumors is based on a subgroup analysis of 80 iCCA patients 
included in a large randomized phase III trial (n = 410, ABC-02 Trial) of 
patients with advanced biliary tract tumors. In the second-line setting, a 
phase 3 study randomized patients who had progressed on cisplatin and 
gemcitabine  to  mFOLFOX  (leucovorin,  fluorouracil,  and  oxaliplatin) 
versus  best  supportive  care.  The  chemotherapy  regimen  showed  an 
improvement in median OS to 6.2 months (adjusted HR 0.69).

Two  molecular  targeted  therapies  have  been  approved  in  the  
second-line setting in iCCA patients with IDH1/2 mutations or FGFR2 
aberrations. A phase 3 trial compared ivosidenib, an IDH-1 inhibitor, 
versus placebo; ivosidenib improved progression-free survival (2.7 vs 
1.4  months;  HR  0.37)  and  OS.  A  single-arm  phase  2  study  assessing 
pemigatinib (FGFR2 inhibitor) in iCCA patients with FGFR2 fusions 
showed a median survival of 21 months and an objective response rate 
of 35%.

Mixed  HCC-iCCA  is  a  rare  neoplasm  accounting  for  <0.5%  of  all 
primary  liver  cancers.  Diagnosis  is  based  on  pathology.  The  2010 
WHO  classification  defined  two  subtypes:  the  classical  and  the  stem 
cell  feature  type.  Molecular  data  have  defined  a  third  unique  entity, 
cholangiocellular carcinoma, with distinct molecular traits and better 
outcome. Due to its low incidence, the demographic features and clin-
ical behavior of these tumors remain ill-defined. Survival and manage-
ment are similar to iCCA.

 ■ EXTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA
Perihilar  and  Distal  Cholangiocarcinoma  The  eighth  edi-
tion  AJCC/UICC  TNM  staging  classification  has  established  pCCAs 
as  tumors  that  arise  between  the  second-order  bile  ducts  up  to  the 
insertion  of  the  cystic  duct,  whereas  dCCAs  arise  from  this  point 
to  the  ampulla  of  Vater  (Fig.  82-7).  Thus,  dCCA  can  be  difficult  to 
distinguish from early pancreatic cancer. Both entities have a similar 
diagnostic  approach.  Acute  onset  of  painless  jaundice  occurs  in  90% 
of patients with pCCA, and 10% present with cholangitis. Primary bil-
iary cholangitis with a cutoff for CA 19-9 >129 U/mL is suspicious for 
CCA. Imaging assessment starts with CT and MRI; they have a good 
sensitivity and specificity (>85%) for detecting the degree of bile duct 
involvement  and  hepatic  and  portal  vein  invasion.  MRI  cholangiog-
raphy is optimal for defining the extent of the bile duct lesion. Ruling 
out  IgG4  cholangiopathy  by  assessing  serum  IgG4  is  mandatory.  As 
a  second  step,  endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiography  with  brushing 
to explore cytology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 
exploring polysomy are recommended. FISH enhances the sensitivity 
of cytology from 20 to ~40%.

Diagnosis is based on pathology. The treatment algorithm for pCCA 
indicates that in cases of a dominant stricture with positive cytology/
biopsy or polysomy, a lymph node biopsy via endoscopic ultrasound 
should be obtained. pCCA with negative lymph node involvement is 
best treated by surgery, resection, or transplantation, the sole curative 
options.  Staging  laparoscopy  is  recommended  to  exclude  metastatic 
disease  before  surgery;  metastases  occur  in  15%  of  cases.  Resection 
entails  hepatic  and  bile  duct  removal  and  Roux-en-Y-hepaticoje-
junostomy with regional lymphadenectomy. Bilobular involvement is 
considered  a  surgical  contraindication.  Perioperative  mortality  is  as 
high as 10%, mostly as a result of liver failure. In a few referral centers, 
unresectable single pCCA <3 cm without dissemination can be consid-
ered for liver transplantation with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. This 
procedure  is  associated  with  5-year  survival  rates  of  ~70%.  If  lymph 
node involvement is present, systemic chemotherapy can be considered 
along  with  biliary  tract  stenting.  Surgical  resection  (Whipple  proce-
dure) is the primary option for management of dCCA, a procedure that 
achieves a median survival of 2 years and 5-year survival rates of ~25%. 
Main  contraindications  for  resection  are  presence  of  distant  lymph 
node  involvement,  metastases,  or  major  vascular  invasion.  At  the 
pathologic  examination,  perineural  invasion,  lymph  node  metastasis, 
R0  resection  (absence  of  residual  tumor  at  pathologic  examination), 
and tumor differentiation are predictors of survival. Adjuvant therapy 
with capecitabine for 6 months is accepted based on the BILCAP study. 

Consensus  statements  endorse  first-  and  second-line  chemotherapy 
strategies  for  unresectable  eCCA  similar  as  for  iCCA.  No  molecular 
targeted therapies are available for these entities.

 ■ GALLBLADDER CANCER
Gallbladder  cancer  is  the  most  common  cancer  of  the  biliary  tract 
worldwide.  The  estimated  cases  of  gallbladder  cancer  in  the  United 
States in 2020 were 11,980, more than CCA. The female-to-male ratio 
is 3:1. Cholelithiasis is the major risk factor, but <1% of patients with 
cholelithiasis develop this cancer. Gallbladder polyps at risk of trans-
formation  are  those  ≥10  mm  in  diameter.  Early  cases  are  discovered 
incidentally  at  routine  cholecystectomy.  Clinical  symptoms,  such  as 
jaundice,  pain,  and  weight  loss,  are  associated  with  advanced  stages. 
Staging of gallbladder cancer follows the TNM classification. The most 
accurate  technique  to  define  staging  and  vascular  and  biliary  tract 
invasion  is  magnetic  resonance  cholangiopancreatography.  CT  and 
PET scans can be also useful for preoperative staging.

The mainstay of treatment is surgical, either simple or radical chole-
cystectomy (partial hepatectomy and regional lymph node dissection) 
for stage I or II disease, respectively. Only ~20% of patients are candi-
dates for surgery with curative intent. Survival rates are near 80–90% 
at 5 years for stage I disease and range from 60 to 90% at 5 years for 
stage II disease. Regional nodal status and the depth of tumor invasion 
(T  status)  are  the  two  most  important  prognostic  factors.  Adjuvant 
therapy  with  capecitabine  is  recommended  in  R0  cases.  Gallbladder 
cancers  at  stage  III  and  IV  are  considered  unresectable.  For  patients 
with  ECOG  of  0–1,  chemotherapy  with  gemcitabine  and  cisplatin  is 
the  standard  of  practice  based  on  data  from  the  subgroup  analysis 
including  181  patients  with  gallbladder  cancer  in  the  setting  of  two 
clinical trials. Overall, median survival is 10–12 months in advanced 
cases. Percutaneous transhepatic drainage is indicated in case of biliary 
obstruction. Radiotherapy is not effective.

OTHER MALIGNANT LIVER TUMORS
 ■ FIBROLAMELLAR HEPATOCELLULAR 
CARCINOMA
Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare form of primary 
liver cancer that typically affects children and young adults (10–30 years 
of age) without background liver disease. FLC accounts for 0.85% of all 
primary  hepatic  malignancies  in  the  United  States,  and  its  incidence 
rate is 0.02 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. FLC is considered a unique 
entity  with  a  specific  fusion  oncogene  PRKACA-DNAJB1  present  in 
80–100% of cases. A few mutations have been described, all at a level 
of <10%. FLC has a better prognosis than HCC, probably due to the 
absence of cirrhosis and the earlier age of presentation. Surgical resec-
tion  is  the  mainstay  of  treatment,  and  indications  are  less  restrictive 
than  for  HCC.  A  retrospective  series  of  575  FLC  cases  reported  a 
median survival of 70 months after resection. At advanced stages, the 
expected outcome is <20 months. Chemotherapy is not effective, and 
there is no standard of care.

 ■ HEPATOBLASTOMA
Hepatoblastoma  (HB)  is  the  most  frequent  primary  liver  tumor  in 
children. The incidence of the disease is 1.5 cases per 1,000,000. Back-
ground  liver  disease  is  rare  in  these  patients.  WNT  signaling  plays 
a  major  role,  with  CTNNB1  mutations  (70%)  as  the  most  frequently 
reported  molecular  event.  Overexpression  of  IGF2  and  genes  in  the 
14q32  DLK1/DIO3  locus  are  also  prevalent.  Resection  followed  by 
chemotherapy  with  doxorubicin  is  the  mainstay  treatment  strategy. 
A  study  including  1605  patients  randomized  in  eight  clinical  trials 
reported better outcome for patients with stage I–II of the PRETEXT 
(Pretreatment Extent of Tumor) classification (out of four stages), age 
<3 years, AFP >1000 ng/mL, and absence of metastases. As opposed to 
HCC, low AFP indicates poor prognosis. The best candidates (stage I 
or II with small tumors, age <3 years, and AFP >100 ng/mL) achieve 
5-year  disease-free  survival  after  resection  of  90%,  compared  with 
5-year disease-free survival of 20–30% in the worst candidates (meta-
static disease and AFP <100 ng/mL).

PART 4Oncology and HematologyBENIGN LIVER TUMORS
The most common benign liver tumors are hemangiomas, focal nod-
ular  hyperplasia  (FNH),  and  hepatocellular  adenomas  (HCA).  Most 
benign tumors are identified incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or 
other imaging techniques. Hemangiomas are present in ~5% of the gen-
eral  population  and  are  diagnosed  by  ultrasound,  except  in  cirrhotic 
patients  or  oncology  patients  in  whom  contrast-enhanced  imaging 
(contrast-enhanced ultrasound, CT, or MRI) is required. Conservative 
management is appropriate and follow-up is not recommended. Excep-
tionally,  growing  lesions  causing  symptoms  by  compression  can  be 
considered for resection. FNH is a benign tumor present in <2% of the 
population and occurs mostly in females aged 40–50 years. FNH is a 
polyclonal hepatocellular proliferation due to an arterial malformation. 
MRI  has  the  highest  diagnostic  accuracy  with  a  specificity  of  100% 
when typical imaging features are present (homogeneous enhancement 
in the arterial phase with a central scar). Atypical FNH requires biopsy 
for  diagnosis.  Treatment  is  not  recommended  since  these  tumors  do 
not degenerate or cause complications. In exceptional cases of expand-
ing symptomatic lesions, surgery is the treatment of choice.

Hepatic  adenomas  are  clonal  benign  proliferations  resulting  from 
single-gene driver mutations. HCAs have a low prevalence of 0.001% 
of  the  population  and  are  frequently  diagnosed  in  women  aged  
35–40 years. The female-to-male ratio is 10:1, and the main risk fac-
tors are oral contraceptives in females and use of anabolic androgenic 
steroids  in  male  body  builders.  HCAs  have  the  potential  for  hemor-
rhage  and  HCC  development,  particularly  when  >5  cm.  Molecular 
classification  of  HCA  is  defined  as  follows:  (1)  HCA  with  CTNNB1 
mutations (10–20%) are at risk of HCC development and are present 
in men treated with androgens; (2) inflammatory adenomas (50–60%) 
are  associated  with  single  mutations  (Gp130:  65%)  and  are  more 
prevalent in females with obesity or diabetes; and (3) adenomas with 
inactivated HNF1A. Diagnosis is based on MRI, which correlates with 
molecular subtypes in 80% of cases (inflammatory and HNF-1A type). 
For defining HCA with CTNNB1 mutations, biopsy is required. Upon 
diagnosis,  discontinuation  of  oral  contraceptives  and  weight  loss  are 
recommended. Resection is indicated in all cases of >5 cm, in men, or 
in those with CTNNB1 mutation. For HCA <5 cm, 1-year follow-up is 
recommended. In case of active HCA bleeding, embolization followed 
by resection is the treatment of choice. The presence of multiple HCAs 
is common, and guidelines endorse treating them based on the size of 
the main nodule.

Pancreatic  cancer  is  the  third  leading  cause  of  death  from  cancer  in 
the  United  States,  with  >57,000  Americans  diagnosed  and  >47,000 
dying  from  the  disease  each  year.  Unfortunately,  pancreatic  cancer 
is  projected  to  be  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  from  cancer  
in  the  United  States  by  2030.  Worldwide,  pancreatic  cancer  is  the 
eleventh  most  common  cancer  with  458,000  new  patients  diagnosed 
and >432,000 deaths (seventh cause of cancer deaths). Pancreatic can-
cer currently has the worst survival rate of any cancer with an overall 
5-year survival (regardless of stage) of ~8.2%. However, that situation is 
changing. In particular, (1) knowledge about specific molecular subsets 
of the disease has become crucial to provide the best possible care for 
patients, and (2) the application of treatment that improves survival for 
patients with advanced disease used either after surgery or even earlier 
in the disease has improved survival.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Pancreatic  cancer  accounts  for  3.2%  of  all  new  cancer  cases  in  the 
United  States  and  for  7.8%  of  all  deaths  from  cancer  in  the  United 
States. The lifetime risk of developing pancreatic cancer is ~1.7%. The 
incidence  of  pancreatic  cancer  has  been  increasing  about  1.03%  per 
year. Pancreatic cancer is more common with increasing age and more 
common in men than in women. The 5-year survival rate for all stages 
has only increased from 3% in 1975 to 9% in 2015. The latest informa-
tion from the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
database  predicts  that  the  5-year  survival  for  patients  with  localized 
pancreatic  cancer  is  about  37%,  12%  for  those  with  regional  disease, 
and  3.1%  for  patients  with  advanced  metastatic  disease.  Pancreatic 
cancer  is  more  common  in  developed  countries  (although  generally 
it tracks with the prevalence of smoking). The incidence is highest in 
Western Europe and North America followed by other areas in Europe, 
Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  South-Central  Asia.  The  population  at 
greatest  risk  are  women  living  in  Scandinavian  countries,  while  the 
lowest risk is seen for women living in middle Africa.

 ■ RISK FACTORS
Age is one of the greatest risk factors for pancreatic cancer with median 
age at diagnosis of 70 years (the disease is most frequently diagnosed 
in the 65–79 age group; for men, 65–69; for women, 75–79). The num-
ber  of  new  cases  per  100,000  persons  and  the  number  of  deaths  per 
100,000 persons are higher for males and for blacks of both sexes. Both 
the number of cases and the number of deaths per 100,000 people are 
lower for American Indian/Alaskan natives and Asian Pacific Islanders. 
Both the number of cases and deaths are intermediate for the Hispanic 
population. People who have a non-O blood type are at higher risk of 
developing pancreatic cancer.
Environment  The  greatest  risk  factor  for  pancreatic  cancer  is 
cigarette  smoking.  The  risk  correlates  with  the  increased  number  of 
cigarettes smoked and persists for at least 10 years after smoking cessa-
tion. About 30% of pancreatic cancer is caused by smoking. Exposure 
to cadmium as part of cigarette smoking or via exposure to welding,

soldering,  or  dietary  exposure  has  been  weakly  associated  with  an 
increased risk of pancreatic cancer.

Although dietary factors are often difficult to interpret, high intakes 
of  fat  or  meat  (particularly  well-done  barbequed  meat)  are  risk  fac-
tors.  High  intakes  of  citrus  fruits  and  vegetables  are  associated  with 
a  decreased  risk.  Coffee  and  low-to-moderate  alcohol  consumption 
are not associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancers, while 
consumption of sugary carbonated drinks has been associated with an 
increased risk.

Microbiome  To  date,  no  solid  evidence  links  Helicobacter  pylori 
infection and pancreatic cancer. Some data link the oral microbiome 
associated with poor dentition to pancreatic cancer, but the evidence 
is very thin.

Hereditary/Genetics  Hereditary factors may account for 10–16% 
of all pancreatic cancers. Family members of patients with pancreatic 
cancer  should  seek  participation  in  an  early  detection  program  with 
genetic  counseling,  definition  of  risk,  and  if  appropriate,  periodic 
MRI  screening  of  the  abdomen,  although  this  recommendation  is 
not  yet  based  on  research  data.  In  addition,  the  identification  of  any 
pancreatic cancer–associated germline mutations could lead to specific 
and  effective  new  therapeutics  for  patients  with  these  abnormalities 
in their tumors. Table 83-1 identifies the various germline mutations 
along with their familial cancer syndromes where an increased risk for 
pancreatic cancer is known.

Knowing  the  patient  has  a  BRCA2  or  PALB2  germline  mutation 
or  any  of  the  above  mutations  should  lead  one  to  not  only  refer  the 
patient’s  relatives  to  an  early  detection  or  high-risk  individual  clinic 
but also realize that for patients with a BRCA2/PALB2 germline muta-
tion consideration for treatment with a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP)  inhibitor  should  be  considered  (see  below).  Other  germline 
mutations  are  under  study  to  determine  their  increased  risk  of  pan-
creatic cancer, including CFTR, PRSS2, CDK4, FANCC, PALLD, APC, 
ATM, BMPR1A, BRCA1, EPCAM, MEN1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NF1, 
PMS2, SMAD4, TP53, TSC1, TSC2, and VHL. Some of these mutations 
are associated with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Chap. 84).

In  addition  to  the  recognized  genetic  syndromes,  other  possible 
familial  pancreatic  cancer  genes  have  not  yet  been  discovered.  For 
example,  a  family  history  of  pancreatic  cancer  is  associated  with  a 
13-fold increase in the disease. If you have one first-degree relative, the 
risk is increased 4.6-fold, having two first-degree relatives increases the 
risk 6.4-fold, and three or more first-degree relatives confers a 32-fold 
increased risk. The risk is also increased if a relative developed pancre-
atic cancer at <55 years old.

aParticularly common in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. bForty percent 
chance of pancreatic cancer by the age of 70. cVery important because this is 
associated with microsatellite instability, which is a marker for response to an 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent.

Other Considerations  Most patients with pancreatic cancer relate 
that they have had developing symptoms over the past few years. Thus, 
early detection of the disease is possible when the index of suspicion 
is high.

Medical  Conditions  Chronic  pancreatitis  that  is  nonfamilial  is 
also associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (2.3–16.5-
fold increase). Risk is also increased in people with chronic pancreatitis 
associated with cystic fibrosis or tropical pancreatitis.

A  clear  association  exists  between  diabetes  mellitus  (both  type  1 
and  type  2)  and  pancreatic  cancer.  Whether  this  is  a  causal  associa-
tion or whether the diabetes is the result of the cancer is not exactly 
clear.  What is clear is that when a person presents with new-onset type 
2  diabetes,  they  should  be  considered  at  risk  for  having  pancreatic  
cancer. The excessive insulin or insulin-like growth factors associated 
with adult-onset diabetes and metabolic syndrome may promote pan-
creatic carcinogenesis.

Obesity is considered a possible risk factor for pancreatic cancer. A 
high body mass index (BMI) ≥30 is associated with a doubling of the 
risk of pancreatic cancer. Since obesity is a risk factor for diabetes, the 
contribution  of  obesity  alone  is  unclear.  Interestingly,  patients  with 
severe  obesity  who  undergo  a  gastric  bypass  experience  a  reduction 
in  the  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  (GI)  cancer,  including  pancreatic 
cancer, by >30% in the first 3 years (along with a dramatic decrease in 
their hemoglobin A1c and blood glucose). Physical inactivity also has 
been associated with an increased risk in pancreatic cancer.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND MOLECULAR CONSIDERATION
Location  The posterior location of the pancreas in the abdomen is 
likely one of the issues that leads to a late diagnosis (Fig. 83-1A).

Pathology  Cancers of the pancreas can be divided into neoplasms 
of the endocrine pancreas (Chap. 84) and tumors of the exocrine pan-
creas. The most common neoplasm of the exocrine pancreas and most 
deadly is pancreatic infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma. These tumors 
arise in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas and are characterized by 
infiltrating desmoplastic stromal reactions (Fig. 83-1B).

Other  subtypes  of  nonneuroendocrine  pancreatic  cancers  include 
acinar cell carcinoma (tumors of the exocrine enzyme producing cell), 
medullary  carcinoma,  adenosquamous  carcinoma,  and  other  rare 
subtypes. Each of these is different in behavior and in their molecular 
characteristics and often requires other specific types of treatment.
Molecular Characteristics  The molecular characteristics of pan-
creatic  ductal  adenocarcinoma  reveal  four  genes  that  are  commonly 
mutated or inactivated (sometimes referred to as the “four horsemen”). 
The most common is KRAS (usually in codon 12). It is critical to deter-
mine  the  specific  mutation  in  KRAS  because  specific  mutations  may 
indicate specific therapies that should be considered. KRAS mutations 
are seen in virtually 100% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In fact, with 
the deep sequencing now available, if a KRAS mutation is not detected 
in the patient’s tumor, one should consider that the tumor is likely of 
a different origin (e.g., small bowel, gallbladder, or cholangiocarcinoma—
all of which could require different treatments). p16/CDKN2A is also 
noted  in  >90%  of  invasive  pancreatic  adenocarcinomas.  TP53  and 
DPC4/MADH4 are mutated in about half of these tumors. As a refer-
ence point, the BRCA2 gene noted in Table 83-1 is mutated in 7–10% 
of pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

Precursor  Lesions  Many  pancreatic  adenocarcinomas  seem  to 
arise  from  noninvasive  epithelial  precursor  lesions.  Detection  of  these 
could  allow  for  early  diagnosis  of  pancreatic  cancer.  These  pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) have varying degrees of dysplasia des-
ignated as PanINs 1–3 (and constitute a progression model for pancreatic 
cancer). Genetic alterations become more frequent as the PanIN grade 
increases (e.g., grade 3). Not all PanIN lesions progress to invasive malig-
nancy. PanINs that are ≥1 cm are called intraductal papillary neoplasms 
and are usually noninvasive. If the intraductal tumor is in a branch duct, 
it is usually noninvasive; however, if the intraductal tumor is in a main 
duct and is large and nodular, it is more likely to have malignant behavior.

One other pancreatic tumor is the mucinous cystic neoplasm; they 
may be seen as incidental findings on scans. These lesions are less likely 
invasive (20%) unless they are large and have nodules in them.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
History and Physical  The classic presentation for a patient with 
pancreatic  cancer  has  been  abdominal  pain  and  weight  loss  with  or 
without  jaundice.  The  pain  is  midepigastric  (sometimes  described 
as  a  “boring-like”  pain).  Often  the  pain  is  in  the  back  (due  to  retro-
peritoneal invasion of the splanchnic nerve plexus). The pain may be 
exacerbated by eating or lying flat. Other items of note in a history are 
light stool color from the absence of bile (steatorrhea also causes mal-
odorous stools) and the onset of diabetes in the prior year. Jaundice, 
first detectable with a bilirubin of 2.5–3.0 mg/dL, is usually associated 
with tumor in the head of the pancreas. In some instances, depression 
is noted (with a higher subsequent number of suicides). Pruritis may 
be seen when the bilirubin reaches 6–8 mg/dL.

Physical signs include jaundice, signs of weight loss, a palpable gall-
bladder  (Courvoisier’s  sign),  hepatomegaly,  an  abdominal  mass,  and 
even an enlarged spleen (usually indicating a portal vein thrombosis). 
Migratory  superficial  thrombophlebitis  can  also  be  seen  (Trousseau’s 
syndrome). Signs of late disease include a lymph node palpable in the 
supraclavicular fossa (usually on the left where the thoracic duct enters 
the  subclavian  vein).  This  is  clinically  referred  to  as  Virchow’s  node. 
Occasionally, one can palpate subcutaneous metastases in the perium-
bilical area referred to as a Sister Mary Joseph’s node—named after one 
of the scrub nurses on the Mayo Clinic Operative Team who noted that 
when she prepped that area and felt those nodules, the patient often 
had peritoneal metastases.

The  history  and  symptoms  noted  above  may  lead  a  person  to  see 
a  physician;  often  CT  and  MRI  scanning  detects  the  disease  before 
advanced disease symptoms appear.

 ■ DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP
Imaging  Diagnostic imaging plays a major role in diagnosing pan-
creatic cancer and other intraabdominal diseases. The best technique 

is the use of a dual-phase contrast-enhanced spiral CT using the pan-
creatic cancer protocol, which allows arterial phase enhancement and 
portal venous phase enhancement. This special protocol can provide 
helpful prospective staging and assessment of resectability. Figure 83-2 
demonstrates such a CT scan (with vascular involvement). Figure 83-3 
demonstrates the use of an 18F glucose positron emission tomography 
(PET) scan.

Histologic  Diagnosis  A  histologic  (tissue)  diagnosis  is  essential 
and should be obtained with a cutting biopsy needle (not a skinny needle 
with cytology). Misdiagnosis is more common based on only fine-nee-
dle aspirates. Obtaining a tissue diagnosis allows not only for accuracy 
but also for molecular testing for KRAS mutations, microsatellite insta-
bility,  and  other  important  molecular  abnormalities.  Those  molecular 
abnormalities and others will be increasingly important as more targeted 
therapies are developed for patients with pancreatic cancer.

The  core  needle  (16–18  gauge)  biopsy  can  be  obtained  via  endo-
scopic ultrasound-guided techniques for a tumor localized to the pan-
creas or, if there are liver lesions or Virchow’s node, via percutaneous 
biopsy by interventional radiologists.

Serum  Markers  Before  treatment,  a  serum  sample  should  be 
obtained  for  levels  of  CA19-9,  carcinoembryonic  antigen  (CEA),  or 
if both are negative, for CA125 (can be positive when the CA19-9 is 
negative due to the patient not being a Lewis antigen secretor). These 
markers are not useful for staging but can be useful in following the 
course of pancreatic cancer.

 ■ IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATIONS IN 
PATIENT CARE
While the patient is being evaluated and staged, one must be alert for 
biliary  tract  obstruction  (and  the  attendant  risk  for  sepsis  from  the 
biliary  tree).  A  stent  can  be  placed  (plastic  if  temporary  or  metal  if 
needed longer) to relieve the jaundice and pruritus. If surgery is being 
contemplated,  an  early  surgical  consultation  is  in  order  as  some  sur-
geons  may  want  to  proceed  to  surgery  without  placement  of  a  stent. 
This immediate surgical approach is becoming less common as many 
multidisciplinary  teams  want  consideration  of  use  of  chemotherapy

with or without radiation therapy (called neoadjuvant therapy) before 
a patient is taken to surgery.

Patients with pancreatic cancer are often hypercoagulable and fre-
quently  have  migratory  thrombophlebitis  (Trousseau’s  sign)  as  well 
as deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary emboli (a frequent cause of

death).  Appropriate  examinations  plus  being  alert  to  thromboses  on 
the routine workup are mandatory so appropriate management can be 
put in place.

Control  of  pain  or  of  any  symptoms  should  be  pursued  to  help 
patients  be  as  comfortable  as  possible  for  their  decision-making. 
Sometimes simple approaches like the use of a replacement pancreatic 
enzyme (at good therapeutic doses) can relieve the bloating, cramping, 
and diarrhea. Early involvement of a palliative care team can improve a 
patient’s quality of life and sometimes even its length.

 ■ CLINICAL STAGING
The  clinical  staging  of  pancreatic  cancer  according  to  the  American 
Joint Commission on cancer staging is presented in Table 83-2.

Table 83-3 presents another clinical way to express extent of disease 

as well as therapeutic approaches (to be discussed later).

For proper staging, some physicians believe that a laparoscopy either 
before  or  at  the  time  of  surgery  is  important.  If  metastatic  disease  is 
found at laparoscopy, one can avoid surgery that would not be helpful 
because disease is already advanced.

TREATMENT
Resectable Disease

Even  for  patients  with  resectable  disease,  the  patient  should  be 
presented to a combined-modality conference. Some clinicians feel 
the  best  approach  for  patients  with  resectable  disease  (as  defined 
in Table 83-3) is surgery. Only a small percentage of patients are in 
this  category  (10–20%).  Some  clinicians  feel  neoadjuvant  therapy 
(chemotherapy before surgery) should be given before surgery (for 
controlling potential micrometastatic disease and shrinking the pri-
mary tumor). The surgery for patients with tumors in the head or

uncinate body of the pancreas is usually a pylorus-sparing pancre-
aticoduodenectomy  (a  modified  Whipple  procedure).  For  tumors 
in  the  body  or  tail,  a  distal  pancreatectomy  is  usually  performed. 
Clinical  and  pathologic  findings  of  the  resection  are  defined  as 
either an R0 resection (no macroscopic or microscopic disease left 

after surgery) or an R1 resection, which refers to residual disease 
likely left behind. Patients with smaller tumors and lymph node–
negative  disease  have  a  better  survival  (median  of  about  18–23 
months with 5-year survival of about 20%).

Two approaches are being explored to try to improve on this.

irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (T Conroy et al: N Engl J Med 379:2395, 2018).

1.  Postoperative adjuvant therapy. The standard of care is to use 24 
weeks of adjuvant treatment with a modified folinic acid, 5-flu-
orouracil,  irinotecan,  and  oxaliplatin  (FOLFIRINOX)  regimen. 
In the definitive clinical trial, the median survival was 54 months 
for the combination of modified FOLFIRINOX versus 35 months 
for gemcitabine alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.48–0.86; p = .003). Toxicities were manageable.
2.  A newer approach is the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (che-
motherapy given before surgery) to try to shrink the tumor and 
normalize  the  patient’s  serum  CA19-9  level.  Data  suggest  that 
patients who have borderline resectable/locally advanced disease 
can  benefit  from  neoadjuvant  therapy.  Studies  of  neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy are ongoing. 

LOCALLY ADVANCED DISEASE (30% OF PATIENTS) 
For patients with locally advanced disease, the median survival is 
also  quite  poor  (6–10  months)  because  many  of  the  patients  die 
with  local  problems  (e.g.,  portal  vein  thrombosis  with  bleeding

varices, obstruction, sepsis). The approach has been to try to reduce 
the bulk of the disease with use of radiation therapy plus chemo-
therapy or chemotherapy alone, with the goal that the disease could 
become resectable. No standard therapy has been agreed upon, but 
experimental approaches are applying some of the treatments that 
show promise in advanced metastatic disease. 

ADVANCED METASTATIC DISEASE (60% OF PATIENTS) 
Only a few of the many phase 3 randomized trials in patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer have led to meaningful increases in sur-
vival. We have learned that a regimen needs to have at least a 50% 
improvement  in  overall  survival  or  90%  improvement  in  1-year 
survival in a pilot phase 2 trial to predict for any degree of success 
in large randomized phase 3 trials.

Patients with the best chance of receiving a benefit from treat-
ment have a good performance status (functioning up and around 
at least 70% of the day), have a reasonable albumin level (≥3.0 g/dL), 
and a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio of ≤5.0.

Single-agent gemcitabine achieves a median survival of 6 months 
and  a  1-year  survival  rate  of  18%.  Table  83-4  details  three  com-
bination  regimens  that  have  further  improved  survival  modestly. 
Median overall survival still ranges from 6 to 11 months. However, 
1-year survival is now approaching 35% for these combination reg-
imens with some long-term 4+ year survivors.

Also of note in Table 83-4, liposomal irinotecan has U.S. Food 
and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approval  in  combination  with 
5-fluorouracil  and  leucovorin  for  patients  whose  tumors  have 
progressed  on  gemcitabine  (e.g.,  second-line  therapy  for  stage  IV 
disease) based on improved overall survival. 

FOR PATIENTS WITH A SPECIFIC MOLECULAR PROFILE IN 
THEIR TUMOR/GERMLINE 
PARP  inhibitors  have  clinical  activity  against  pancreatic  cancers 
having mutations in BRCA2, BRCA1, or PALB2 (i.e., defective DNA

to specific combinations of chemotherapy like gemcitabine plus cis-
platin. In addition, tumors with microsatellite instability often have 
more mutations, and such tumors appear to have a higher response

OTHER POTENTIAL FACTORS INFLUENCING SURVIVAL 
Preclinical  studies  have  suggested  that  vitamin  D  can  inhibit  the 
development and growth of cancer. In models of pancreatic cancer, 
synthetic analogues of vitamin D had an effect on both tumor cells 
and  on  the  tumor  microenvironment.  Clinical  studies  are  conflict-
ing as to whether circulating levels of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25[OH]D)  affect  the  incidence  of  pancreatic  cancer.  However, 
patients with prediagnostic levels of 25(OH)D that are in the nor-
mal range have a longer survival than those who have reduced levels 
(35% lower hazard for death).

 ■ FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Death  from  pancreatic  cancer  is  often  due  to  progressive  inanition. 
The  metabolic  consequences  of  this  cancer  are  being  examined.  The 
tumor  can  be  fatal  at  a  modest  level  of  tumor  burden  based  on  the 
profound  metabolic  effects.  Other  promising  areas  of  investigation 
include addressing the florid stromal reaction around the tumor cells 
(believed to act as a physical barrier to drug delivery and as an immune 
sanctuary for the tumor cells). Improvements in outcomes for pancre-
atic cancer would accompany earlier detection. A small decrease in the 
percentage of patients being diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer 
has been noted. The reason for this encouraging sign is unknown. The 
5-year survival for earlier stage patients has increased from 44.7% in 
2004 to 83.7% in 2012. There is emerging evidence that the surveillance 
to detect CDKN2A mutation carriers can detect pancreatic ductal cancer 
at a resectable stage.

PART 4Oncology and Hematology84 Gastrointestinal 

Neuroendocrine Tumors
Matthew H. Kulke

Gastrointestinal  (GI)  neuroendocrine  tumors  (NETs)  can  be  broadly 
grouped  according  to  their  site  of  origin,  as  either  extrapancreatic 
NETs, historically called carcinoid tumors, or pancreatic NETs. While 
NETs  can  pursue  a  broad  range  of  clinical  behaviors,  they  classically 
follow a course that is more indolent than many other malignancies. 
NETs also have the ability to synthesize peptides, growth factors, and 
bioactive amines that may be ectopically secreted, giving rise to a range 
of unique clinical syndromes.

INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
The diagnosed incidence of NETs has been steadily increasing over the 
past several decades (Fig. 84-1). An analysis of data from the Surveil-
lance,  Epidemiology,  and  End  Results  (SEER)  program,  comprising 
population-based data in the United States from 1973 to 2012, showed 
that the incidence had increased 6.4-fold over this time period and that 
the estimated prevalence of patients who had been diagnosed with a 
NET was >170,000. This analysis also found that overall survival dura-
tions for patients with NETs had improved significantly. The increasing 
incidence  and  improved  survival  durations  for  patients  with  NETs 
likely reflect, at least in part, advances in both diagnosis and treatment. 
While environmental or other factors leading to an increased incidence 
of  NETs  cannot  be  excluded;  common  cancer  risk  factors  such  as 
tobacco or alcohol use and dietary patterns have not been clearly linked 
to NET development.

A minority of NETs develop in the context of autosomal inherited 
genetic  syndromes  associated  with  mutations  in  specific  tumor-
suppressor  genes.  The  most  common  of  these  is  multiple  endocrine 
neoplasia  type  1  (MEN  1),  due  to  mutation  and  loss  of  function  of 
the menin gene, located on chromosome 11q13 (Chap. 388). Patients 
with  MEN  1  are  at  risk  for  developing  pancreatic  NETs  as  well  as 
hyperparathyroidism  and  pituitary  adenomas;  less  commonly,  they 
may develop bronchial and thymic NETs. Other inherited syndromes 

associated  with  NETs  include  von  Hippel–Lindau  disease  (VHL),  
von Recklinghausen’s disease (neurofibromatosis type 1), and tuberous 
sclerosis (Bourneville’s disease). Inherited mutations in the VHL gene, 
located on chromosome 3p25, are associated with the development of 
cerebellar hemangioblastomas, renal cancer, and pheochromocytomas 
and,  less  commonly,  pancreatic  NETs.  Mutations  in  neurofibromin 
(NF1)  are  associated  with  neurofibromatosis  (von  Recklinghausen’s 
disease); patients with neurofibromatosis are at risk of developing both 
pancreatic and extrapancreatic NETs. Tuberous sclerosis is caused by 
mutations that alter either hamartin (TSC1) or tuberin (TSC2). Both 
hamartin and tuberin function as inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase  and  the  mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  signaling 
cascades,  and  pancreatic  NETs  have  been  reported  in  these  patients. 
Rare  cases  of  familial  small  intestine  NETs  have  also  been  reported; 
in these cases, multiple synchronous tumors generally arise within the 
small intestine. A characteristic inherited mutation, however, has not 
been identified to date in the majority of these cases.

HISTOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION AND 
MOLECULAR FEATURES
The histologic features of NETs vary widely and are one of the most 
important determinants of both clinical behavior and treatment. NETs 
are classified based on the degree tumor differentiation (well or poorly 
differentiated), as assessed by a pathologist, and tumor grade (grades 
1–3) (Table 84-1). Tumor grade closely correlates with mitotic count 
and  Ki-67  proliferative  index.  Classic,  well-differentiated  NETs  are 
composed  of  monotonous  sheets  of  small  round  cells  with  uniform 
nuclei  and  only  rare  mitoses.  Immunocytochemical  staining  for 
chromogranins  and  synaptophysin  is  typical.  Ultrastructurally,  these 
tumors  contain  electron-dense  neurosecretory  granules  containing 
peptides and bioactive amines that may be ectopically secreted, giving 
rise to a range of clinical syndromes. These classic well-differentiated 
NETs have low-grade features and generally have a mitotic index of <2 
mitoses per 10 high-power field (HPF) and a Ki-67 proliferative index 
of <3%. Less commonly, well-differentiated NETs have an intermedi-
ate  histologic  grade  and  pursue  a  somewhat  more  aggressive  clinical 
course.  These  intermediate-grade  tumors  typically  have  a  mitotic 
count  of  2–20  per  10  HPF  and  a  mitotic  index  of  3–20%.  Well-dif-
ferentiated  high-grade  tumors  are  rare  and  have  mitotic  counts  that 
exceed 20 per 10 HPF and a Ki-67 proliferative index of >20%. Poorly

differentiated  high-grade  tumors  form  the  most  clinically  aggressive 
category;  prognosis  and  treatment  for  these  tumors  differ  markedly 
from their well-differentiated counterparts.

Whole  exome  sequencing  of  sporadic  pancreatic  NETs  found  that 
the  most  frequently  altered  gene  was  MEN1,  occurring  in  44%  of 
tumors. In addition, 43% of tumors had mutations in genes encoding 
two  subunits  of  a  transcription/chromatin  remodeling  complex  con-
sisting  of  DAXX  (death-domain-associated  protein)  and  ATRX  (α- 
thalassemia/mental  retardation  syndrome  X-linked).  Mutations  in 
genes  associated  with  the  mTOR  pathway  were  identified  in  15%  of 
tumors.  In  contrast,  recurrent  mutations  in  extrapancreatic  NETs 
appear  to  be  rare.  In  one  study  that  evaluated  180  small  intestinal 
NETs using a combination of whole exome and more targeted genome- 
sequencing  analysis,  recurrent  mutations  were  only  observed  in  the 
CDKN1B  gene  (cyclin-dependent  kinase  inhibitor  1B  [p27Kip1])  in 
8%  of  cases.  Loss  of  chromosome  18  is  a  common  finding  in  small-
bowel NETs. Small-intestinal GI carcinoids commonly have epigenetic 
changes; however, the clinical significance of these alterations remains 
uncertain.  Initial  studies  have  suggested  that  well-differentiated  pan-
creatic and extrapancreatic NETs express only low levels of the immune 
checkpoint markers PD-1 and PD-L1.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND 
MANAGEMENT OF LOCALIZED 
PANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS
Pancreatic  NETs  have  been  subcategorized  as  either  “functional,” 
meaning  associated  with  symptoms  of  hormone  secretion,  or  non-
functional, in which case they may be clinically silent until they cause 
anatomic symptoms. The clinical presentation of functional pancreatic 
NETs  depends  on  the  type  of  hormone  secreted  and  can  sometimes 
lead to dramatic clinical presentations (Table 84-2). The most common 
functional  pancreatic  NETs  are  insulinomas,  followed  in  incidence 
by  glucagonomas  and  gastrinomas.  Pancreatic  NETs  secreting  other 
hormones, including somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH),  and  parathyroid  hormone 
(PTH)  have  also  been  described  but  are  uncommon.  Only  ~20%  of 
pancreatic  NETs  are  associated  with  symptoms  of  hormone  hyperse-
cretion; the majority of pancreatic NETs are “nonfunctional” and are 
diagnosed either incidentally or after patients present with abdominal 
pain, weight loss, or other anatomic symptoms related to tumor bulk.
 ■ GASTRINOMA
Patients with gastrinoma typically present with Zollinger-Ellison syn-
drome  (ZES)  (Chap.  324).  The  most  common  symptoms  associated 
with  this  syndrome  are  abdominal  pain,  diarrhea,  gastroesophageal 
reflux  disease  (GERD),  and  peptic  ulcer  disease.  Peptic  ulcer  disease 
manifesting as multiple ulcers with associated diarrhea is a classic pre-
sentation. Up to 25% of patients with ZES have MEN 1, and a diagnosis 
of gastrinoma should prompt a family history as well as an assessment 
for  concurrent  hyperparathyroidism.  Fasting  hypergastrinemia  is  a 
nearly  universal  finding  in  patients  with  gastrinoma.  Importantly, 
however,  proton  pump  inhibitors  (PPIs)  can  suppress  acid  secretion 
sufficiently to cause hypergastrinemia and can confound the diagno-
sis. Achlorhydria, usually in the context of chronic atrophic gastritis, 
will also elevate serum gastrin levels but can usually be easily distin-
guished from gastrinoma given the absence of other evidence of acid 
hypersecretion.

While  often  classified  as  pancreatic  NETs,  the  majority  of  gastri-
nomas  in  fact  arise  in  the  “gastrinoma  triangle,”  an  anatomic  region 

bounded  by  the  duodenum,  pancreas,  and  confluence  of  the  cystic 
and common bile ducts. Most gastrinomas (50–90%) in sporadic ZES 
arise in the duodenum. They are frequently small and may be difficult 
to localize. Imaging studies generally include either CT or MRI; endo-
scopic ultrasound or somatostatin scintigraphy may also be helpful.

PPIs  are  generally  highly  effective  in  the  treatment  of  symptoms 
related to gastrinoma and are considered the initial treatment of choice. 
Rapid resolution of both abdominal pain and diarrhea related to acid 
hypersecretion is common. Somatostatin analogues may also be helpful 
in controlling symptoms in refractory cases. Once symptoms are con-
trolled, surgical resection is generally recommended for patients with 
sporadic gastrinomas, both to eliminate the cause of gastrin secretion 
and  to  decrease  the  risk  of  developing  metastatic  disease.  The  tech-
nique used for resection depends in large part on the precise location of 
the tumor. In some cases where preoperative imaging is not successful 
but  a  diagnosis  is  strongly  suspected,  exploratory  laparotomy  with 
intraoperative ultrasound may be undertaken. In gastrinoma patients 
who have underlying MEN 1, tumors are generally small and multiple; 
the role of routine surgery in this setting remains more controversial 
but generally is still recommended in patients with larger tumors mea-
suring ≥1.5–2 cm in diameter.
 ■ INSULINOMA
Patients with insulinoma generally present with symptoms of hypogly-
cemia, which may include confusion, headache, disorientation, visual 
difficulties, irrational behavior, and even coma. In some cases, the diag-
nosis of insulinoma may not be immediately evident, and patients with

insulinoma may initially be diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses that in 
retrospect were hypoglycemic symptoms. The diagnosis of insulinoma 
is generally confirmed with elevated fasting insulin levels in conjunc-
tion with elevated proinsulin and C-peptide. Fasting hypoglycemia can 
also be caused by severe liver disease, alcoholism, and poor nutrition. 
Postprandial hypoglycemia may also occur after gastric bypass surgery. 
Surreptitious  use  of  insulin  or  hypoglycemic  agents  may  be  difficult 
to  distinguish  from  an  insulinoma.  Evaluation  of  proinsulin  and  
C-peptide  levels,  both  of  which  should  be  normal  in  patients  using 
exogenous  insulin,  and  measurement  of  sulfonylurea  levels  in  serum 
or plasma are helpful in such cases.

The  hypoglycemia  associated  with  insulinomas  can  be  severe  and 
challenging  to  manage.  Diazoxide  has  historically  been  used  in  the 
initial management of patients with insulinoma and results in inhibi-
tion of insulin release, though it can also be associated with side effects 
including sodium retention and nausea. Everolimus, in addition to its 
antitumor effect (see below), is highly effective in improving glycemic 
control in patients with insulinoma. The benefits of everolimus in this 
setting  may  be  related  both  to  induction  of  insulin  resistance  and  a 
direct antitumor effect. While somatostatin analogues are usually effec-
tive in treating symptoms of hormone hypersecretion associated with 
other types of NETs, they should be used with caution in patients with 
insulinoma.  Somatostatin  analogues  may  suppress  counterregulatory 
hormones,  such  as  growth  hormone  (GH),  glucagon,  and  catechola-
mines, and precipitously worsen hypoglycemia.

Insulinomas may be difficult to localize, as they are less consistently 
avid on somatostatin scintigraphy than other pancreatic NETs. Insuli-
nomas are also generally small, with the majority measuring <2 cm in 
diameter.  Because  of  their  generally  small  size,  insulinomas  are  best 
localized with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). In the absence of meta-
static disease, surgical resection is usually recommended. The primary 
treatment  for  exophytic  or  peripheral  insulinomas  is  enucleation.  If 
enucleation is not possible because of invasion or the location of the 
tumor within the pancreas, then pancreatoduodenectomy for tumors 
in the head of the pancreas or distal pancreatectomy with preservation 
of the spleen for smaller tumors not involving splenic vessels may be 
considered.

 ■ GLUCAGONOMA
Patients  with  glucagonoma  most  commonly  present  with  a  charac-
teristic  dermatitis,  called  necrolytic  migratory  erythema  (Fig.  84-2). 
The rash usually involves intertriginous sites, especially in the groin or 
buttock, and can wax and wane. Other common presenting symptoms 
of glucagonoma include glucose intolerance and weight loss. The diag-
nosis of glucagonoma can be confirmed by demonstrating an increased 
plasma glucagon level, generally in excess of 1000 pg/mL. Somatostatin 
analogues are usually highly effective as an initial treatment to alleviate 
the symptoms and rash associated with glucagon hypersecretion. The 
majority of glucagonomas are large in size at presentation and arise in 
the tail of the pancreas. For patients with localized disease, distal pan-
createctomy  and  splenectomy  are  recommended.  A  hypercoagulable 
state has been reported in up to 33% of patients with glucagonoma, and 
perioperative anticoagulation should generally be employed.

 ■ SOMATOSTATINOMA
Patients with somatostatinoma typically present with diabetes mellitus, 
gallbladder disease, diarrhea, and steatorrhea. Somatostatinomas occur 
primarily in the pancreas or duodenum, are usually large, and are com-
monly metastatic at presentation. They are only rarely associated with 
MEN 1. The diagnosis of somatostatinoma is based on the demonstra-
tion of elevated plasma somatostatin levels, and as such, the potential 
benefits of using somatostatin analogs as a treatment for patients with 
somatostatinoma is questionable. Surgery is recommended for patients 
with localized disease.

 ■ VIPOMA
VIPomas  are  associated  with  a  distinct  syndrome  that  has  been  var-
iously  called  Verner-Morrison  syndrome,  pancreatic  cholera,  and 
WDHA syndrome (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria). 

FIGURE  84-2  Glucagonoma  syndrome.  Patients  with  glucagonoma  may  present 
with a classic skin rash, necrolytic migratory erythema (shown). Other presenting 
symptoms include glucose intolerance and weight loss.

VIP is a 28-amino-acid peptide that mimics the effects of the cholera 
toxin  by  stimulating  chloride  secretion  in  the  small  intestine  and 
increasing smooth-muscle contractility, resulting in profound diarrhea. 
Treatment  of  dehydration,  hypokalemia,  and  electrolyte  losses  with 
fluid and electrolyte replacement is the most critical initial treatment 
for patients with VIPoma. VIPomas are usually solitary and arise in the 
pancreatic tail. Elevated plasma levels of VIP are typical but should not 
be the only basis of the diagnosis of VIPomas because they can occur 
with  some  diarrheal  states  including  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  in 
the  setting  of  small  bowel  resection,  and  radiation  enteritis.  Chronic 
surreptitious  use  of  laxatives/diuretics  can  be  particularly  difficult  to 
detect  clinically.  Somatostatin  analogues  are  usually  highly  effective 
in  controlling  the  diarrhea;  surgical  resection  is  recommended  for 
patients with localized disease.
 ■ OTHER SECRETORY PANCREATIC NETS
Pancreatic  NETs  secreting  GH-releasing  factor  (GRF),  calcitonin, 
ACTH,  and  PTH-related  protein  have  also  been  described;  it  is  also 
possible for pancreatic NETs to secrete more than one hormone or for 
the secretory profiles to evolve over time. Gastrinomas, in particular, 
may evolve and may be associated with secretion of ACTH, resulting 
in  ectopic  Cushing’s  syndrome.  Tumors  secreting  these  hormones 
may  not  be  as  responsive  to  treatment  with  somatostatin  analogues 
as  the  more  common  pancreatic  NETs  and  the  associated  hormonal 
symptoms  may  cause  significant  morbidity.  As  with  other  pancreatic 
NETs, patients with localized disease are generally treated with surgi-
cal resection. In patients with ACTH-secreting tumors, the associated 
symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome can be alleviated with adrenalectomy 
if  resection  of  the  primary  tumor  is  not  possible  or  in  the  setting  of 
metastatic disease.
 ■ PANCREATIC NETS ARISING IN THE SETTING OF 
MEN 1
Pancreatic NETs occurring in patients with MEN 1 are typically mul-
tiple and often pursue a relatively indolent course. Because of the high 
probability of multiple tumors, surgical resection of confirmed pancre-
atic NETs in patients with MEN 1 is usually undertaken with caution 
given  the  likelihood  of  tumors  arising  in  the  remaining  pancreas  if

partial pancreatectomy is undertaken as well as the significant morbid-
ities associated with total pancreatectomy. However, for symptomatic 
tumors  or  for  growing  tumors  >2  cm  in  size,  surgical  resection  may 
still be considered.
 ■ NONFUNCTIONING PANCREATIC NETS
As  noted  above,  the  majority  of  pancreatic  NETs  are  not  associated 
with symptoms of hormone hypersecretion and are considered “non-
functional.”  As  a  result,  they  often  remain  clinically  silent  and  either 
are  diagnosed  incidentally  or  are  not  diagnosed  until  widespread, 
metastatic disease is present resulting in anatomic symptoms. If they 
are  localized  at  diagnosis,  the  general  treatment  recommendation  is 
surgical  resection;  however,  the  management  of  small,  asymptomatic 
pancreatic NETs is debated. Assuming tumors are low grade, patients 
with  incidentally  discovered,  low-grade  tumors  measuring  <1  cm  in 
size can be safely followed; other retrospective studies have suggested 
nonoperative management for nonfunctioning pancreatic NETs mea-
suring up to 3 cm. In contrast, however, an analysis of the SEER data-
base suggested that at least some tumors measuring <2 cm in size can 
pursue  a  more  aggressive  course.  Management  of  small,  incidentally 
discovered,  asymptomatic,  low-grade  pancreatic  NETs  is  therefore 
based  on  clinical  judgement,  taking  into  account  surgical  risk  and 
patient comorbidities.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND 
MANAGEMENT OF LOCALIZED 
EXTRAPANCREATIC GASTROINTESTINAL 
NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS
Extrapancreatic  GI  NETs,  historically  called  carcinoid  tumors,  may 
arise virtually anywhere in the GI tract and differ significantly in their 
clinical characteristics depending on their location. The most common 
locations for extrapancreatic NETs are the stomach, distal small intes-
tine, appendix, and rectum.
 ■ GASTRIC NETS
Gastric NETs can be categorized into three groups: type 1 (associated 
with  chronic  atrophic  gastritis);  type  2  (associated  with  gastrinomas 
and ZES), and type 3 (sporadic, gastric NETs). Type 1 gastric NETs are 
the most common of the three types. In type 1 gastric NETs, chronic 
atrophic gastritis results in loss of acid secretion with consequent loss 
of the negative feedback loop on gastrin-producing cells in the antrum 
of the stomach. Pernicious anemia is also commonly associated with 
this  condition;  classic  laboratory  findings  are  a  markedly  elevated 
gastrin level and low levels of vitamin B12. Unchecked gastrin secretion 
in  these  patients  results  in  hyperplasia  of  the  endocrine  cells  in  the 
gastric fundus. A typical finding on endoscopy is diffuse endocrine cell 
hyperplasia with multiple gastric carcinoid tumors (Fig. 84-3). These 
tumors generally pursue a benign course and can be monitored with 
serial endoscopy. In cases where tumors continue to grow or become 
symptomatic, antrectomy to remove the source of gastrin production

Huang MD, Boston Medical Center.)

can  result  in  tumor  regression.  Type  2  tumors  are  rare  and  usually 
occur in the setting of gastrinoma; as with type 1 gastric NETs, elevated 
gastrin levels result in diffuse gastric neuroendocrine hyperplasia and 
multifocal  gastric  NETs.  Resection  of  the  gastrinoma,  removing  the 
source of gastrin production, is the treatment of choice.

In contrast to type 1 and type 2 gastric NETs, type 3 gastric NETs are 
generally solitary, arise in the setting of normal gastrin levels, and may 
pursue a far more aggressive course. For early-stage, smaller tumors, 
endoscopic or wedge resection may be performed. For larger tumors, 
partial gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is recommended.
 ■ NETS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE
Small-bowel NETs occur most commonly in the terminal ileum and are 
notoriously difficult to diagnose at an early stage. One reason for this 
is that they arise within the muscularis, and their submucosal location 
makes them difficult to see during routine colonoscopy (Fig. 84-4A). 
Small-bowel NETs are also often multifocal; multifocal tumors appear 
to  arise  independently  throughout  the  small  intestine,  although  the 
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain uncertain.

Small-bowel  NETs  are  often  associated  with  desmoplasia  and 
mesenteric  fibrosis,  likely  as  a  result  of  fibroblast  proliferation  stim-
ulated  by  tumor  serotonin  secretion.  Mesenteric  fibrosis  frequently

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyresults  in  intermittent  small-bowel  obstruction  and,  in  some  cases, 
bowel ischemia due to involvement of the mesenteric vessels. Patients 
may  experience  symptoms  of  intermittent  abdominal  pain  and  asso-
ciated diarrhea, sometimes for months or years before diagnosis, that 
because  of  the  difficulty  in  diagnosis  are  often  attributed  to  irritable 
bowel syndrome. One classic finding that can aid in diagnosis is that 
the  lymph  node  metastases  associated  with  small  intestine  NETs  are 
usually  larger  than  the  primary  tumor  and  may  be  calcified,  which, 
together with the tethering of the small intestine caused by the asso-
ciated  fibrosis,  results  in  a  classic  “spoke  and  wheel”  appearance  on 
computed tomography (Fig. 84-4B).

Surgical  resection  of  the  primary  tumor  and  associated  metastases 
is  recommended  when  feasible  and  is  performed  with  curative  intent 
when distant metastatic disease is not already present. Resection should 
also  be  considered  in  patients  with  metastatic  disease  experiencing 
intermittent obstruction or abdominal discomfort thought to be related 
to the primary tumor or associated mesenteric disease. Some have also 
advocated the routine resection of asymptomatic small-bowel primary 
tumors  in  patients  with  distant  metastatic  disease,  with  the  rationale 
that this may be a way to prevent the future development of fibrosis and 
obstruction and preempt the development of unresectable disease due 
to tumor involvement of the mesenteric vessels. However, the available 
data on the benefits of resecting an asymptomatic primary tumor in this 
context are conflicting. Some studies have suggested that this practice 
results in an overall survival benefit, but the retrospective nature of these 
studies makes the data difficult to interpret given the high potential for 
selection  bias  in  patients  taken  to  surgery  compared  with  those  who 
were not. Other studies have suggested that prophylactic primary tumor 
resection  confers  no  survival  benefit  and  that  surgery  can  be  safely 
delayed until it is indicated based on the development of symptoms.

 ■ NETS OF THE APPENDIX
NETs  are  one  of  the  most  common  tumors  arising  in  the  appendix. 
They  are  typically  discovered  incidentally  in  younger  individuals 
undergoing  appendectomy  for  acute  appendicitis  and  not  uncom-
monly are identified only at the time of pathology review. While the 
unexpected  diagnosis  of  an  appendiceal  NET  in  such  situations  can 
cause  considerable  anxiety,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  the  prognosis  is 
excellent. Indeed, the clinical behavior of appendiceal NETs has been 
inferred from multiple large retrospective surgical series that suggest 
that  the  risk  of  lymph  node  or  distant  metastases  from  appendiceal 
NETs with well-differentiated histology and a tumor diameter measur-
ing <2 cm is extremely low. In such cases, appendectomy alone is felt 
to be a sufficient surgical procedure.

In  contrast,  the  risk  of  metastases  for  tumors  measuring  2–3  cm 
is  ~20–30%  and  is  even  greater  for  tumors  measuring  >3  cm.  For 
patients  with  larger  tumors,  more  formal  staging  studies  with  either 
cross-sectional  imaging  or  somatostatin  scintigraphy  are  generally 
recommended to assess for distant metastases, and a subsequent right 
colectomy to remove regional lymph nodes is performed if no distant 
metastases  are  observed.  Whether  right  colectomy  should  be  per-
formed for tumors measuring <2 cm with features such as mesoappen-
diceal invasion or tumor origin at the appendiceal base, which in some 
series  have  suggested  a  poorer  prognosis,  remains  uncertain.  Addi-
tionally, tumors may arise in which neuroendocrine cells are admixed 
with mucin-producing cells or cells exhibiting features of frank adeno-
carcinoma.  In  such  mixed  neuroendocrine-adenocarcinoma  tumors, 
sometimes termed “adenocarcinoids,” treatment recommendations are 
generally dictated by the more aggressive component of the tumor and 
align with typical recommendations for colorectal adenocarcinoma.

 ■ RECTAL NETS
With  the  increased  use  of  screening  colonoscopy,  the  diagnosis  of 
rectal  NET  has  also  become  more  common.  For  unclear  reasons, 
the  incidence  of  rectal  carcinoid  tumors  shows  geographic  variation. 
In  European  studies,  they  compose  up  to  14%  of  all  NETs,  while  in 
some Asian series (Japan, China, Korea), they compose up to 90% of 
all NETs. The majority of rectal NETs are small, measuring <1 cm in 
diameter,  and  have  well-differentiated  histology.  These  tumors  rarely 

metastasize  and  can  usually  be  safely  removed  endoscopically  with 
subsequent  endoscopic  monitoring.  In  contrast,  up  to  one-third  of 
rectal NETs between 1 and 2 cm are associated with metastases, and 
those  >2  cm,  though  uncommon,  metastasize  in  >70%  of  patients. 
When identified early, these tumors generally require a surgical resec-
tion. In contrast to NETs of the appendix and small intestine, hormone 
secretion from rectal NETs, even when metastatic, is exceedingly rare.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION, DIAGNOSIS, 
AND EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH 
METASTATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS
While patients who undergo resection of localized NETs may be at risk 
of  developing  tumor  recurrence  or  metastatic  disease,  postoperative 
treatment has not yet been shown to alter the risk of recurrence, and 
systemic adjuvant therapy is not recommended following resection of 
well-differentiated NETs, as it is for some other cancers. Whether adju-
vant  systemic  therapy  may  be  of  benefit  following  resection  of  high-
grade  NETs  is  uncertain,  and  an  approach  utilizing  platinum-based 
chemotherapy with or without external-beam radiation, analogous to 
that used in small-cell carcinoma, is sometimes considered.

The evaluation of patients with known or suspected metastatic dis-
ease generally includes both standard cross-sectional imaging such as 
CT or MRI and somatostatin scintigraphy. Somatostatin scintigraphy 
in this setting is based on the fact that >90% of NETs express soma-
tostatin  receptors.  Gallium-68  (68GA)  dotatate,  a  radioligand  bound 
to a somatostatin analogue, can be used as a nuclear medicine tracer 
to  perform  PET  scanning  and  is  highly  sensitive  in  detecting  both 
primary  NETs  and  metastases  (Fig.  84-5).  Because  of  the  sensitivity 
of this approach, false-positive results can occur due to somatostatin 
receptor expression in other tissues. Physiologic uptake in the pancre-
atic uncinated process is common; uptake can also occur in the setting 
of  sarcoidosis,  in  meningiomas,  and  in  thyroid  goiter  or  thyroiditis. 
Standard  fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  positron  emission  tomography 
(PET) scans are often negative in well-differentiated NET due to their 
low  metabolic  activity  but  can  show  uptake  in  higher-grade  tumors; 
conversely, rates of somatostatin expression tend to be lower in higher-
grade tumors, and 68GA dotatate scans may be negative in this setting.
The utility of blood-based tumor markers in NETs is controversial. 
The  circulating  tumor  marker  chromogranin  A  is  commonly  used 
as  a  screen  for  the  presence  of  NETs  and  also  to  monitor  for  both

recurrence and progression of disease in patients with known metas-
tases.  While  chromogranin  A  is  elevated  in  patients  with  metastatic 
NETs,  it  is  neither  particularly  sensitive  nor  specific.  A  broad  range 
of different assays for chromogranin A have also posed challenges in 
interpreting results in a standardized fashion. Chromogranin A is often 
elevated in a number of nonmalignant conditions, including in patients 
with impaired renal function and in patients who are taking PPIs. Ele-
vated values of chromogranin A should be interpreted with caution in 
patients in whom a NET is being considered but in whom a diagnosis 
has not been established.

The  overall  survival  durations  for  patients  with  metastatic  NETs 
vary  significantly,  depending  on  both  the  primary  location  of  the 
tumor and the histologic grade. Median survival durations for patients 
with well-differentiated NETs have markedly increased in recent years, 
likely reflecting both earlier diagnoses and improved treatments. For 
example, in early analyses of the SEER database, the median survival 
for  patients  with  advanced  pancreatic  NETs  was  ~2  years;  this  had 
increased to 4 years in a more recent analysis. Similar increases were 
observed  in  patients  with  advanced  small  intestine  NETs,  where  the 
median  survival  for  patients  with  well-differentiated  small  intestine 
NETs  exceeds  5  years.  The  sometimes  prolonged  survival  of  patients 
with  NETs  can  sometimes  make  it  challenging  to  determine  at  what 
point  to  initiate  treatment.  In  patients  with  symptoms  of  hormone 
secretion, decisions to initiate therapy are straightforward. In asymp-
tomatic  patients,  on  the  other  hand,  observation  off  treatment  can 
sometimes be appropriate. Nevertheless, the natural course of NETs is 
ultimately to progress, and if treatment is not initiated, close monitor-
ing  is  essential  to  ensure  patients  maximize  access  to  available  treat-
ment options over the course of their disease.

MANAGEMENT OF SYMPTOMS OF 
HORMONE HYPERSECRETION AND THE 
CARCINOID SYNDROME
Patients  with  advanced  NETs  may  in  some  cases  experience  more 
symptoms from hormone hypersecretion than from tumor bulk. The 
management of hormonal symptoms associated with pancreatic NETs 
depends on the hormone being secreted (see above). Patients with GI 
NETs, particularly those with small intestine or appendiceal primaries, 
may  develop  the  carcinoid  syndrome.  Flushing  and  diarrhea  are  the 
two most common symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome. The 
characteristic  flush  is  of  sudden  onset;  it  is  a  deep  red  or  violaceous 
erythema of the upper body, especially the neck and face, often asso-
ciated with a feeling of warmth. Flushes may be precipitated by stress, 
alcohol, exercise, and certain foods such as cheese. Flushing episodes 
initially are brief, lasting 2–5 min, though later in the disease course, 
they may last hours. The diarrhea associated with carcinoid syndrome 
may or may not be associated with flushing and is described as watery 
in  nature.  Diarrhea  can  be  profound,  sometimes  occurring  in  excess 
of 10 times daily and is one of the symptoms that most significantly 
interferes  with  activities  of  daily  living.  Less  common  manifestations 
of the carcinoid syndrome include wheezing or asthma-like symptoms. 
Impaired  cognitive  function  has  also  been  described  in  particularly 
advanced cases.

The main secretory product implicated in the carcinoid syndrome 
is serotonin (5-HT). Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by the 
enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (Fig. 84-6). Up to 50% of dietary tryp-
tophan can be used in this synthetic pathway by tumor cells, resulting 
in inadequate supplies for conversion to niacin; hence, some patients 
develop  symptoms  of  niacin  deficiency  and  pellagra-like  lesions. 
Serotonin has numerous biologic effects, including the stimulation of 
intestinal secretion, increasing intestinal motility, and the stimulation 
of fibroblast growth. Other secreted products contributing to carcinoid 
syndrome  symptoms  are  thought  to  include  histamines  and  tachyki-
nins, including substance P.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF THE

almost  any  site,  it  is  most  commonly  associated  with  appendiceal  or

Tryptophan  is  converted  to  hydroxytryptophan  by  tryptophan  hydroxylase  within 
the  tumor  cell  and,  subsequently,  to  serotonin  (5-HT).  Serotonin  is  subsequently 
converted to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), which can be measured in a 24-h 
urine collection and can facilitate the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. Telotristat 
ethyl inhibits tryptophan hydroxylase and can be used as a treatment for carcinoid 
syndrome.

small intestine NETs. In these patients, the syndrome usually develops 
only  after  the  development  of  hepatic  metastases  or  retroperitoneal 
lesions,  allowing  entry  of  serotonin  and  other  vasoactive  substances 
into the systemic circulation. While serotonin levels can be measured 
in plasma, such measurements are frequently highly variable. Evidence 
of excess serotonin secretion can be more reliably confirmed by mea-
suring  levels  of  the  serotonin  metabolite  5-hydroxyindole  acetic  acid 
(5-HIAA), commonly using a 24-h urine collection. Urine collections 
can  be  challenging,  and  false-positive  elevations  may  occur  if  the 
patient is eating serotonin-rich foods (e.g., salmon, eggs). As a result, 
elevated levels of 5-HIAA are suggestive but not diagnostic of the car-
cinoid syndrome. Patients with NETs may also experience symptoms 
of  carcinoid  syndrome  related  to  other  secreted  products,  including 
histamine, absent evidence of serotonin secretion. Conversely, patients 
without  NETs  may  also  describe  symptoms  analogous  to  carcinoid 
syndrome but due to other causes. The symptoms associated with sys-
temic mastocytosis, in particular, can be easily confused with carcinoid 
syndrome.

The  symptoms  of  carcinoid  syndrome,  including  diarrhea,  are 
generally  refractory  to  standard  antidiarrheals  or  other  traditional 
medications  but  can  often  be  well  controlled  with  somatostatin  ana-
logues (Fig. 84-7). Approximately 90% of NETs express somatostatin 
receptors. The presence of somatostatin receptors on NETs can be eas-
ily confirmed with uptake on somatostatin scintigraphy such as  68GA 
dotatate  PET  scan;  uptake  on  somatostatin  scintigraphy  is  predictive 
of  response  to  treatment  with  somatostatin  analogues.  Somatostatin 
is a 14-amino-acid peptide that inhibits the secretion of a broad range 
of hormones. Due to its short half-life, administration of somatostatin

FIGURE  84-7  Somatostatin  analogues.  Commonly  used  somatostatin  analogues  include  octreotide  and  lanreotide,  which  mirror  the  molecular  structure  of  human 
somatostatin and bind to somatostatin receptors on neuroendocrine tumors. Somatostatin analogues inhibit tumoral hormone secretion and also have an antiproliferative 
effect. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogues such as 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate, shown in the figure, share a similar molecular structure and are used therapeutically.

itself  is  not  therapeutically  practical.  Longer-acting  somatostatin 
analogues,  including  octreotide  and  lanreotide,  share  an  8-amino-
acid binding domain with naturally occurring somatostatin and bind 
primarily to somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5. Both have been 
shown to be effective in the treatment of carcinoid syndrome.

In  an  initial  study,  treatment  of  patients  with  octreotide  150  μg 
subcutaneously three times daily controlled symptoms of flushing and 
diarrhea  in  88%  of  patients.  A  depot  preparation  (octreotide  long- 
acting  release  [LAR])  that  can  be  administered  monthly  has  largely 
eliminated  the  need  for  daily  octreotide  injections  and  is  now  con-
sidered  a  standard  approach  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  advanced 
NETs.  Lanreotide,  another  long-acting  somatostatin  analogue  that  is 
also  administered  monthly,  appears  to  have  similar  clinical  efficacy 
to  octreotide  in  the  treatment  of  metastatic  NETs  and  the  carcinoid 
syndrome. As described further below, both octreotide and lanreotide 
also  share  the  ability  to  slow  tumor  growth,  providing  an  additional 
benefit to patients.

Somatostatin analogue side effects are generally mild. Mild nausea, 
abdominal discomfort, bloating, and loose stools occur in up to one-
third of patients during the first month or two of treatment but usually 
subsequently  subside.  Patients  with  persistent  symptoms  of  bloating 
or  loose  stools  may  be  experiencing  pancreatic  insufficiency  associ-
ated  with  use  of  somatostatin  analogues;  use  of  pancreatic  enzyme 
supplements can ameliorate these symptoms. Mild glucose intolerance 
may  also  occur  due  to  inhibition  of  insulin  secretion.  One  of  the 
more  significant  side  effects  associated  with  somatostatin  analogues 
is  impaired  gallbladder  contractility,  resulting  in  delayed  gallbladder 
emptying,  and  long-term  administration  of  somatostatin  analogues 
has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  cholelithiasis.  For  this 
reason, patients with advanced NETs in whom surgery is planned and 
for  whom  somatostatin  analogue  therapy  is  being  considered  should 
generally also undergo prophylactic cholecystectomy.

Over  time,  for  reasons  that  remain  uncertain,  patients  receiving 
somatostatin  analogues  for  symptoms  of  hormone  secretion  may 
become  refractory  to  treatment.  Not  uncommonly,  such  patients 
experience symptom exacerbation toward the final week of each treat-
ment cycle. Such patients may benefit from an increased frequency of 
administration  (i.e.,  every  3  weeks)  or  use  of  additional  short-acting 
octreotide for breakthrough symptoms.

The  association  between  high  levels  of  circulating  serotonin  and 
symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome has also led to a strategy aiming 
to directly inhibit serotonin synthesis (Fig. 84-6). This approach was 

first undertaken in the late 1960s with the drug para-chlorophenyla-
lanine, which was reported to reduce symptoms of carcinoid syndrome 
but also caused significant central nervous system (CNS) side effects. 
Telotristat  ethyl,  a  tryptophan  hydroxylase  inhibitor  with  minimal 
CNS  penetration,  was  evaluated  in  a  randomized  trial  that  enrolled 
135 patients with persistent carcinoid syndrome–related diarrhea while 
receiving somatostatin analogues. Treatment with telotristat ethyl was 
associated with a reduction in bowel movement frequency as well as 
significant  decreases  in  urinary  5-HIAA  compared  to  placebo.  Thus, 
telotristat is a treatment option for patients with carcinoid syndrome 
who  have  persistent  diarrhea  despite  treatment  with  somatostatin 
analogues.

 ■ CARCINOID CRISIS
Carcinoid crisis has been described in the setting of tumor manipula-
tion during surgery and, less commonly, after other interventions such 
as  hepatic  artery  embolization  or  radionuclide  therapy.  It  may  also 
occur as a result of exogenous administration of epinephrine or during 
induction  of  anesthesia.  It  is  most  common  in  patients  who  already 
have  significant  symptoms  of  carcinoid  syndrome  and  is  thought  to 
be caused by a sudden release of biologically active compounds from 
the tumor. Carcinoid crisis can be life-threatening and can manifest as 
either profound hypotension or hypertension. Prospective studies on 
the prevention and management of carcinoid crisis are limited; how-
ever, somatostatin analogues should be readily available during surgical 
procedures,  and  in  some  cases,  continuous  prophylactic  intravenous 
administration  of  somatostatin  analogues  has  been  utilized  as  a  way 
to mitigate risk.

 ■ CARCINOID HEART DISEASE
Carcinoid heart disease occurs in approximately two-thirds of patients 
with the carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid heart lesions are characterized 
by plaque-like, fibrous endocardial thickening that classically involves 
the right side of the heart and often causes retraction and fixation of the 
leaflets of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves (Fig. 84-8). The fibrosis 
in carcinoid heart disease is thought to be directly related to exposure 
of heart valve fibroblasts to high circulating levels of serotonin. Lesions 
similar  to  those  observed  in  carcinoid  heart  disease  were  observed 
in  patients  receiving  fenfluramine,  a  drug  also  known  to  increase 
serotonin  signaling,  as  well  as  in  patients  receiving  ergot-containing 
dopamine  receptor  agonists  for  Parkinson’s  disease.  Metabolites  of 
fenfluramine,  as  well  as  the  dopamine  receptor  agonists,  have  high

approaches  for  such  patients  include  surgical  resection,  ablation  or 
embolization, and orthotopic liver transplantation.

For  patients  with  limited  hepatic  disease  whose  tumors  have 
well-differentiated histology, surgical resection is generally considered 
the  preferable  option.  While  data  are  limited  to  retrospective  series 
with  the  consequent  risk  of  selection  bias,  long-term  survival  dura-
tions  and  symptomatic  improvements  reported  in  select  populations 
of  patients  undergoing  hepatic  resection  of  neuroendocrine  liver 
metastases  compare  favorably  with  outcomes  associated  with  other 
management  approaches,  and  5-year  survival  rates  approach  90%  in 
some  series.  In  patients  in  whom  anatomy  precludes  resection  or  in 
whom a greater number of lesions are present, radiofrequency ablation 
or cryoablation can also be used, either as a primary treatment modal-
ity or as an adjunct to surgical resection. While ablation is considered 
to be less morbid than hepatic resection, it is generally utilized only in 
smaller tumors so that zones of ablation are limited.

In  most  cases,  however,  liver  metastases  are  large,  multiple,  and 
involve  both  lobes  of  the  liver.  In  such  cases,  the  benefit  of  surgical 
resection and ablation is limited. Hepatic arterial embolization can be 
considered in these cases, assuming that extrahepatic disease remains 
relatively limited and that clinical benefit can be achieved by reducing 
hepatic tumor bulk. Hepatic artery embolization is based on the prin-
ciple that tumors in the liver derive most of their blood supply from 
the  hepatic  artery,  whereas  healthy  hepatocytes  derive  most  of  their 
blood  supply  from  the  portal  vein.  Multiple  different  embolization 
techniques  have  been  explored,  ranging  from  the  simple  infusion  of 
gel  foam  powder  into  the  hepatic  artery  (bland  embolization)  to  the 
administration  of  chemotherapy  or  chemotherapy-eluting  beads  into 
the  hepatic  artery  (chemoembolization)  or  the  intra-arterial  admin-
istration  of  radioisotope-tagged  microspheres  (radioembolization). 
Limited  data  suggest  an  optimal  approach  to  embolization,  and  few 
studies have compared these approaches directly. Tumor response rates 
with all of these approaches generally exceed 50%. Specific approaches 
are therefore often tailored to the patient, taking into account tumor 
location,  overall  tumor  burden,  and  comorbidities.  Bland  emboliza-
tion, for example, may be associated with less morbidity, whereas che-
moembolization or radioembolization may result in longer durations 
of response.

The  role  of  orthotopic  liver  transplantation  for  the  treatment  of 
NETs remains uncertain. Data from available institutional series sug-
gest that a small number of highly selected patients may achieve long-
term  survival.  However,  5-year  overall  median  survival  durations  in 
most series are ~50%, and the majority of patients undergoing hepatic 
transplantation  develop  tumor  recurrence.  Additionally,  the  wide-
spread utility of hepatic transplantation is limited by organ availability. 
Decisions regarding proceeding with transplantation in patients with 
advanced NETs are therefore highly individualized.

SYSTEMIC TREATMENT TO CONTROL 
TUMOR GROWTH
While hepatic-directed therapies can be effective in the management 
of patients with liver-predominant disease, a majority of patients will 
either present with or ultimately develop more widespread metastases. 
A number of systemic treatment options have been developed and can 
be effective in treating such patients. These options include treatment 
with traditional somatostatin analogues, peptide receptor radioligand 
therapy, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, and an increasing array of 
molecularly targeted therapies targeting the mTOR or vascular endo-
thelial growth factor (VEGF) pathways (Table 84-3). The choice and 
sequence of therapy depend in part on the type of tumor, the extent of 
disease, and patient symptoms and comorbidities.
 ■ SOMATOSTATIN ANALOGUES
While  somatostatin  analogues  were  originally  developed  as  a  treat-
ment  to  reduce  hormone  secretion  in  NETs,  they  are  also  effective 
in  slowing  tumor  growth.  The  biologic  mechanisms  underlying  this 
effect remain uncertain, but clinical studies have been definitive. The 
first  of  these  studies,  the  PROMID  study,  randomized  patients  with 
metastatic small-intestinal NET to receive either octreotide LAR at a

circulating  serotonin  classically  involves  the  tricuspid  valve,  resulting  in  valve 
retraction and tricuspid regurgitation.

affinity for serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2B receptors, whose activa-
tion is known to cause fibroblast mitogenesis and which are normally 
expressed  in  heart  valve  fibroblasts.  These  observations  support  the 
hypothesis  that  serotonin  overproduction  in  patients  with  carcinoid 
syndrome mediates the valvular changes by activating 5-HT2B receptors 
in the endocardium.

Tricuspid  regurgitation  is  a  nearly  universal  feature  of  carcinoid 
heart disease; tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, and pulmo-
nary stenosis may also occur. Left-sided heart disease occurs in <10% 
of patients and has been associated with the presence of a patent fora-
men ovale. The preponderance of lesions in the right heart is related 
directly  to  the  fact  that  serotonin  is  secreted  by  liver  metastases  or 
retroperitoneal tumor deposits into the venous circulation and subse-
quently into the right atrium and right ventricle. The lower incidence 
of heart disease in the left heart is postulated to be due to the fact that 
serotonin is metabolized in the pulmonary vasculature before entering 
the left atrium and ventricle. Among patients with carcinoid syndrome, 
patients with heart disease exhibit higher levels of serum serotonin and 
urinary 5-HIAA excretion than patients without heart disease. Treat-
ment  with  somatostatin  analogues  resulting  in  decreased  serotonin 
secretion does not result in regression of cardiac lesions. Reduction of 
serotonin levels as a result of treatment with somatostatin analogues or 
with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor telotristat ethyl seems likely 
to slow progression of carcinoid heart disease but has not been formally 
evaluated in clinical trials.

Right-sided  heart  failure  in  patients  with  carcinoid  heart  disease 
may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The development of 
multiple new treatments to improve overall disease control in patients 
with advanced NETs has led to increased interest in valvular replace-
ment, which may result in significant clinical benefit in appropriately 
selected patients with carcinoid heart disease. The appropriate timing 
of  valve  replacement  in  such  patients  can  be  challenging  given  the 
competing desires to perform surgery before the onset of severe right-
sided heart failure, which can increase surgical morbidity, and the need 
to achieve adequate overall tumor control. However, advanced and less 
invasive techniques, including catheter-based valve replacement, have 
made valve replacement an increasingly attractive option for patients 
with this condition.

HEPATIC-DIRECTED THERAPY FOR 
METASTATIC NETS
The liver is one of the most common sites for metastases in patients 
with  NETs  and,  in  some  cases,  is  the  only  site  of  metastatic  disease. 
Hepatic-directed therapies can often be effective as a means of control-
ling, if not eliminating, metastases, particularly in patients who have 
more  indolent  tumors  with  well-differentiated  histology.  Common

dose  of  30  mg  monthly  or  placebo.  The  median  time  to  tumor  pro-
gression  in  patients  receiving  octreotide  was  14  months  compared 
to  only  6  months  for  patients  receiving  placebo.  Because  the  study 
was  limited  to  patients  with  small-intestinal  NET,  the  generalizabil-
ity  of  these  results  to  patients  with  NETs  of  other  origins,  including 
pancreatic NET, was initially uncertain. This question was ultimately 
addressed by the phase 3 CLARINET trial, which compared lanreotide, 
a somatostatin analogue that is similar to octreotide in its somatostatin 
receptor–binding affinities, to placebo in 204 patients with a range of 
advanced  well-  or  moderately  differentiated  gastroenteropancreatic 
NETs. Progression-free survival duration at 2 years was 65% in patients 
receiving lanreotide and 33% in patients receiving placebo, a difference 
that was statistically significant. One unusual aspect of the PROMID 
and CLARINET studies is the difference in progression-free survival 
durations in the placebo arms of the studies, which has been attributed 
to  differences  in  patient  selection.  Either  octreotide  or  lanreotide  is 
currently considered an acceptable option for control of tumor growth 
in patients with advanced NETs.

Whether  treatment  with  somatostatin  analogues  also  increases 
overall survival in patients with advanced NETs has not been demon-
strated, although a correlation between progression-free survival and 
overall  survival  in  patients  with  advanced  NETs  treated  with  sin-
gle-agent somatostatin analogue therapy has been shown. The timing 
of initiation of somatostatin analogues in patients with advanced NETs 
remains  uncertain.  The  variable  clinical  course  of  NETs  means  that 
tumors  can  remain  indolent  for  years  even  without  treatment.  For 
patients with asymptomatic, small-volume disease, observation alone 
may  be  an  appropriate  initial  option.  However,  for  patients  with  a 
larger disease burden, evidence of disease progression, or symptomatic 
disease, somatostatin analogues are generally used as an initial systemic 
treatment due to their ease of use and tolerability.

 ■ PEPTIDE RECEPTOR RADIOLIGAND THERAPY
Peptide receptor radioligand therapy employs the systemic administra-
tion of radiolabeled somatostatin analogues and is a treatment option 
for patients who require more aggressive treatment due to progression 

on  traditional  somatostatin  analogues  or  other  therapies  (Fig.  84-7). 
Peptide  receptor  radioligand  therapy  may  also  be  considered  as  an 
initial treatment in patients with significant symptoms or tumor bur-
den.  With  this  approach,  a  radioligand  is  coupled  to  a  somatostatin 
analogue, using the somatostatin analogue to target the tumor. When 
bound to the tumor cell, the radioligand is then internalized, resulting 
in cell death. Due to its mechanism of action, peptide receptor radioli-
gand therapy is only considered in patients whose tumors demonstrate 
uptake on somatostatin scintigraphy.

Several  different  radioligands  have  been  evaluated,  the  most  suc-
cessful  of  which  have  been  yttrium  (90Y)  and  lutetium  (177Lu).  These 
two ligands differ from one another in terms of their particle energy 
and  tissue  penetration;  of  the  two,  90Y-DOTA-TOC  emits  higher- 
energy β particles and has deeper tissue penetration.  90Y-DOTA-TOC 
(90Y-dotatoc) has been evaluated in numerous series with overall tumor 
responses reported in approximately one-third of patients. Enthusiasm 
for this approach, however, has been tempered due to concerns about 
side effects including both renal and hematologic toxicity.

177Lu-DOTA-octreotate  emits  both  β  particles  and  lower-energy  γ 
particles  and,  in  most  studies,  has  been  associated  with  less  toxicity 
than  90Y-DOTA-TOC.  Initial  single-center  studies  with  177Lu-DOTA- 
octreotate  showed  promising  antitumor  activity,  and  based  on  these 
studies,  a  randomized  trial  of  177Lu-dotatate  in  midgut  GI  NETs  was 
undertaken. In this study (NETTER-1), 229 patients with inoperable, 
somatostatin receptor–positive midgut NETs were randomly assigned 
to  receive  either  four  doses  of  177Lu-dotatate  administered  intrave-
nously  every  8  weeks  or  treatment  with  high-dose  octreotide  LAR  
(60 mg) every 4 weeks. Treatment with  177Lu-dotatate was associated 
with objective tumor responses in 18% of patients and also was asso-
ciated  with  a  significant  improvement  in  progression-free  survival: 
progression-free  survival  at  month  20  was  10.8%  for  octreotide  LAR 
alone and 65.2% in the 177Lu-dotatate group. Subsequent analyses have 
also suggested improved overall survival associated with 177Lu-dotatate 
treatment, as well as improvements in quality of life across a number of 
parameters, including global health status, overall physical functioning, 
fatigue, pain, and diarrhea.

The  renal  clearance  of  radiopeptides,  including  177Lu-DOTA- 
octreotate, poses a risk of renal toxicity. The renal toxicity can be mit-
igated  with  the  coadministration  of  intravenous  amino  acids  during 
treatment. The most common adverse event among patients receiving 
177Lu-dotatate in the NETTER-1 study was nausea, most likely related 
to the amino acid infusions rather than to the radioisotope itself. Mild 
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were also reported.

One limitation of the NETTER-1 study was its restriction to patients 
with advanced small intestine NETs. However, longer-term safety data 
as  well  as  data  supporting  the  efficacy  of  177Lu-dotatate  in  a  broader 
range  of  gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  are  available  from  large  insti-
tutional series that include >1000 patients. Long-term toxicities from 
these series have included rare cases of acute leukemia and myelodys-
plastic syndrome, presumably associated with radiation exposure. Nev-
ertheless, these studies generally support both the efficacy and safety of 
177Lu-dotatate as a treatment for patients with a range of somatostatin 
receptor–positive NETs.

 ■ ALKYLATING AGENTS
While the efficacy of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be 
minimal in most extrapancreatic GI NETs, alkylating agents have a clear 
role in the treatment of advanced pancreatic NETs. Streptozocin-based 
combination  therapy  was  historically  used  as  treatment  standard  in 
such  patients  but  has  largely  fallen  out  of  favor  due  to  both  toxicity 
concerns and a cumbersome administration schedule. Temozolomide 
is  an  orally  administered  alkylating  agent  that  has  largely  replaced 
streptozocin as a backbone in combination regimens used for the treat-
ment of pancreatic NETs.

Initial studies evaluating temozolomide in combination with a range 
of different agents showed that temozolomide-based combination ther-
apy was associated with tumor responses in 24–70% of patients. One 
of the most active combination regimens appeared to be temozolomide 
and  capecitabine.  This  combination  was  subsequently  compared  to

temozolomide  alone  in  a  prospective  randomized  study  undertaken 
by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group that enrolled 144 patients 
with  advanced  pancreatic  NETs.  The  overall  response  rates  in  the 
two  arms  were  relatively  similar;  33%  of  patients  who  received  the 
combination of temozolomide and capecitabine experienced objective 
tumor  responses  as  compared  to  28%  of  the  patients  who  received 
temozolomide  as  a  single  agent.  However,  progression-free  survival 
was significantly longer in the combination arm (22.7 vs 14.4 months). 
Based on these results, the combination of temozolomide and capecit-
abine  is  now  the  preferred  chemotherapy  combination  for  advanced 
pancreatic NETs.

The reason that some pancreatic NETs respond to alkylating agents 
while others do not is uncertain. In patients with glioblastoma, methy-
lation of the promoter region for methylguanine DNA methyltransfer-
ase (MGMT) is associated with decreased MGMT protein expression 
and  is  highly  associated  with  temozolomide  responsiveness.  MGMT 
is  an  enzyme  that  is  responsible  for  repairing  DNA  damage  induced 
by  alkylating  agents.  Reduced  levels  of  MGMT  presumably  impair 
the ability of tumor cells to repair their DNA in response to treatment 
and  enhance  the  cytotoxicity  of  temozolomide.  Several  retrospective 
studies  have  suggested  that  lack  of  MGMT  expression  in  pancreatic 
NET  may  be  associated  with  responsiveness  to  temozolomide-based 
therapy; however, this finding has not yet been prospectively validated.

SMALL-MOLECULE TYROSINE KINASE 
INHIBITORS
The  highly  vascular  nature  of  NETs  combined  with  observations  in 
preclinical  models  that  disruption  of  signaling  pathways  associated 
with VEGF inhibits neuroendocrine cell growth prompted a number 
of  clinical  trials  evaluating  therapeutic  agents  that  inhibit  the  VEGF 
pathway  in  both  pancreatic  and  extrapancreatic  NETs.  The  VEGF 
pathway  is  activated  through  the  binding  of  VEGF  to  its  cell  surface 
receptor,  which  initiates  an  intracellular  signaling  cascade  that  pro-
motes angiogenesis as well as cell growth, proliferation, and survival. 
Clinical  trials  of  VEGF  pathway  inhibitors  in  NETs  have  included  a 
number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that, while they 
differ to some extent in specificity, all have in common the property 
targeting  VEGFR2,  the  receptor  isoform  most  strongly  implicated  in 
promoting angiogenesis.

Sunitinib,  a  multitargeted  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  that  inhibits  a 
range  of  growth  factor  receptors  including  VEGFR2,  was  one  of  the 
first agents in this class found to have activity in pancreatic NETs. In 
an initial phase 2 trial, sunitinib was administered to 109 patients with 
either pancreatic or extrapancreatic NET. Of 61 patients with pancre-
atic NET enrolled in the study, 11 had evidence of an objective tumor 
response. Based on these observations, sunitinib was evaluated in an 
international, randomized trial in which continuous administration of 
sunitinib (37.5 mg daily) was compared with placebo in 171 patients 
with advanced, progressive pancreatic NET. The median progression-
free survival was significantly longer in patients treated with sunitinib 
compared  with  patients  treated  with  placebo  (11.4  vs  5.5  months). 
Common side effects associated with sunitinib included hypertension, 
proteinuria, and fatigue.

A  second  VEGFR-targeted  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  surufatinib, 
has  been  evaluated  in  a  randomized  trial  in  which  264  patients  with 
advanced pancreatic NETs from 21 centers in China were randomized 
to receive either surufatinib, administered at a dose of 300 mg daily, or 
placebo. Patients receiving surufatinib experienced a median progres-
sion-free survival duration of 10.9 months, as compared to 3.7 months 
in patients receiving placebo, closely mirroring the results of the earlier 
sunitinib study. Other small-molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors have 
been evaluated in smaller, single-arm studies and have shown activity 
in pancreatic NETs, including sorafenib, cabozantinib, pazopanib, and 
axitinib.

Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the VEGF path-
way have also been evaluated in patients with advanced nonpancreatic 
GI NET. In most of these studies, objective tumor response rates are 
lower than those seen in pancreatic NET, though many of these initial 
studies also revealed low rates of tumor progression and encouraging 

progression-free  survival  durations,  suggesting  that  these  agents  had 
antitumor activity. Pazopanib was compared to placebo in a random-
ized  study  undertaken  by  the  ALLIANCE  cooperative  group,  which 
enrolled 171 patients with nonpancreatic NETs. Patients treated with 
pazopanib in this study had a superior progression-free survival com-
pared to those who received placebo (11.6 vs 8.5 months), a difference 
that was statistically significant. Surufatinib was used in a randomized 
study of 198 patients with extrapancreatic NETs; the median progres-
sion-free survival was 9.2 months in patients receiving surufatinib and 
3.8 months in those receiving placebo, a statistically significant differ-
ence. These studies suggest that VEGF-targeted tyrosine kinase inhib-
itors have antitumor activity in extrapancreatic and pancreatic NETs.

 ■ mTOR INHIBITORS
mTOR  is  an  intracellular  protein  kinase  that  has  been  implicated  in 
the regulation of a number of processes regulating cell growth in both 
normal and malignant cells. It functions as a downstream component 
of the PI3-AKT-mTOR pathway. This pathway is negatively regulated 
by  the  tuberous  sclerosis  complex,  comprising  TSC1  and  TSC2.  An 
association between the development of pancreatic NETs and inherited 
mutations in TSC2 in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex was a 
contributing factor to initial interest in exploring mTOR inhibition as 
a therapeutic approach in this setting.

Following  initial  evidence  of  antitumor  activity  associated  with 
everolimus (10 mg daily) in an international, multicenter, phase 2 trial 
of 160 patients, everolimus monotherapy (10 mg daily) was compared 
with best supportive care alone in the RADIANT-3 trial that enrolled 
410 patients with advanced progressing pancreatic NET. While overall 
objective responses were uncommon, treatment with everolimus was 
associated with a significant prolongation in median progression-free 
survival  (11.0  vs  4.6  months)  compared  to  placebo,  supporting  its 
use as a standard treatment to control tumor growth in patients with 
advanced pancreatic NET. Common toxicities associated with everoli-
mus  are  generally  mild  and  can  include  stomatitis  and  rash;  a  more 
severe but less common side effect is pneumonitis.

Everolimus  was  also  associated  with  promising  activity  in  early 
phase 2 studies enrolling patients extrapancreatic NET. The first large 
randomized  study  evaluating  everolimus  was  the  RADIANT  2  trial; 
429 patients with advanced GI NETs were randomly assigned to receive 
octreotide LAR (30 mg intramuscularly every 28 days) with or without 
everolimus (10 mg daily). Treatment with everolimus in this study was 
associated  with  an  improvement  in  median  progression-free  survival 
(16.4  vs  11.3  months),  but  the  difference  in  this  study  was  of  only 
borderline  statistical  significance.  A  second  study,  the  RADIANT  4 
study, enrolled 302 patients with advanced NETs of either GI (exclud-
ing  pancreatic)  or  lung  origin,  randomizing  them  to  receive  either 
everolimus or placebo. In this study, treatment with octreotide was not 
required. As in the RADIANT 3 study, objective tumor responses were 
uncommon;  however,  median  progression-free  survival  in  patients 
who  received  everolimus  was  significantly  longer  than  in  those  who 
received placebo (11 vs 3.9 months). Based on the results of this study, 
everolimus  is  considered  a  standard  treatment  for  control  of  tumor 
growth in extrapancreatic NETs.

 ■ OTHER SYSTEMIC TREATMENTS FOR CONTROL 
OF TUMOR GROWTH
Interferon α has been used as a treatment for advanced NETs for sev-
eral decades. With the development of newer approaches, its routine 
use  has  diminished.  The  use  of  interferon  α  was  based  primarily  on 
observations  in  large,  retrospective  series  where  low-dose  interferon 
α was reported to both reduce symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion 
and  slow  tumor  progression.  Interferon  can  be  myelosuppressive, 
requiring dose titration, and in some patients can induce both fatigue 
and  depression.  Antitumor  activity  has  also  been  reported  with 
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. A combined analysis of two 
phase  2  trials  examining  oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine  chemotherapy 
plus  bevacizumab  in  advanced  NET  suggested  antitumor  activity  for 
these  regimens;  the  benefit  appeared  to  be  greatest  in  patients  with 
intermediate-grade rather than low-grade tumors.

PART 4Oncology and Hematology ■ SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR HIGH-GRADE 
NEUROENDOCRINE CARCINOMA
High-grade  NETs  are  relatively  uncommon;  their  clinical  behavior  is 
fundamentally  different  from  well-differentiated  NETs  in  that  these 
tumors pursue an aggressive clinical course. Systemic chemotherapy for 
advanced  high-grade  neuroendocrine  carcinoma  has  historically  fol-
lowed a paradigm analogous to that used for small-cell carcinoma of the 
lung, with combinations of either cisplatin or carboplatin administered 
together  with  etoposide  generally  considered  the  preferred  first-line 
approach. One of the most important elements in determining the opti-
mal chemotherapeutic approach is assessing the Ki-67 proliferative index. 
A large retrospective series that evaluated 252 patients with high-grade 
neuroendocrine  carcinoma  found  that  the  activity  of  platinum-based 
therapy was greatest in patients who had a Ki-67 proliferative index of 
55% or higher; in these patients, the overall tumor response rate was 
42%.  In  contrast,  the  overall  response  rate  in  patients  in  whom  the 
Ki-67 proliferative index was <55% was only 15%. As in small-cell car-
cinoma of the lung, immune checkpoint inhibitors also appear to have 
some activity in high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. While mini-
mal activity has been noted in well-differentiated NETs, a combination 
of  ipilimumab  and  nivolumab  was  associated  with  an  overall  tumor 
response rate of 42% in an initial phase 2 trial enrolling 19 patients with 
high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.

85 Renal Cell Carcinoma

Robert J. Motzer, Martin H. Voss

Renal  cell  carcinomas  account  for  90–95%  of  malignant  neoplasms 
arising  from  the  kidney.  Notable  features  include  frequent  diagnosis 
without  symptoms,  resistance  to  cytotoxic  agents,  robust  activity  of 
angiogenesis-targeted  agents,  immune  infiltration  commonly  render-
ing tumors susceptible to checkpoint-directed immunotherapy, and a 
variable clinical course for patients with metastatic disease, including 
anecdotal  reports  of  spontaneous  regression.  Most  of  the  remaining 
5–10% of malignant neoplasms arising from the kidney are transitional 
cell carcinomas (urothelial carcinomas) originating in the lining of the 
renal pelvis. See Chap. 86 for transitional cell carcinomas.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The incidence of cancers of the kidney and renal pelvis rose for three 
decades, reached a plateau of approximately 64,000 cases annually in 
the United States between 2012 and 2018, but has since increased to 
approximately 76,000 cases annually, resulting in close to 14,000 deaths 
per  year.  It  is  the  eighth  most  common  cancer  overall  in  the  United 
States, the sixth most common in males, and the eighth most common 
in females; the male-to-female ratio is 2:1. Although this malignancy 
may be diagnosed at any age, it is uncommon in those under 45 years, 
and incidence peaks between the ages of 55 and 75 years. Many factors 
have  been  investigated  as  possible  contributing  causes;  associations 
include  cigarette  smoking,  obesity,  and  hypertension.  Risk  is  also 
increased  for  patients  with  polycystic  kidney  disease  that  has  been 
complicated by chronic renal failure.

Most  cases  of  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  are  sporadic,  although 
familial  forms  have  been  reported  (Table  85-1).  One  well  estab-
lished  example  includes  clear  cell  RCC  arising  in  the  context  of  von 
Hippel-Lindau  (VHL)  syndrome,  an  autosomal  dominant  disor-
der.  Genetic  studies  identified  the  VHL  gene  on  the  short  arm  of 
chromosome  3.  Individuals  with  VHL  syndrome  have  an  estimated 
lifetime risk of developing clear cell RCC of around 70%. Other VHL- 
associated neoplasms include retinal hemangioma, hemangioblastoma 
of the spinal cord and cerebellum, pheochromocytoma, and neuroen-
docrine tumors and cysts. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare human 
autosomal  dominant  genetic  disorder  characterized  by  fibrofollicu-
lomas (benign tumors arising in hair follicles), pulmonary cysts, and 
renal cell carcinomas of varying histologies, most commonly the chro-
mophobe type, occurring in about a third of patients. This disorder is 
associated with mutations in the FLCN gene, which codes for folliculin. 
Other hereditary syndromes are summarized in Table 85-1.

 ■ PATHOLOGY AND GENETICS
Renal  cell  malignancies  represent  a  heterogeneous  group  of 
tumors  with  distinct  histopathologic,  genetic,  and  clinical  features  
(Table 85-2).  Categories  include  clear  cell  carcinoma  (70%  of  cases), 
papillary tumors (10–15%), chromophobe tumors (≤5%), renal med-
ullary  carcinoma  (<1%),  translocation  carcinoma  (<5%),  and  other 
less common variants. Papillary tumors can be bilateral and multifocal. 
Chromophobe  tumors  tend  to  have  a  more  indolent  clinical  course. 
Translocation-associated  RCC,  rare  in  adult  patients,  is  the  predom-
inant  histology  in  children.  Renal  medullary  carcinoma  is  rare,  very 
aggressive,  and  associated  with  sickle  cell  trait.  Tumors  that  do  not 
meet criteria for defined variants are generally referred to as “unclassi-
fied” with variable clinical courses.

Clear cell tumors, the predominant histology, are found in >80% of 
patients who develop metastases and arise from the epithelial cells of 
the proximal tubules. Loss of chromosome 3p is uniformly seen as the 
earliest  event  in  the  development  of  these  cancers.  This  leads  to  loss 
of  heterozygosity  for  a  number  of  relevant  3p  genes,  including  VHL, 
PBRM1,  BAP1,  and  SETD2,  which  can  be  functionally  lost  through 
secondary  events  in  the  remaining  allele.  VHL  encodes  a  tumor 
suppressor  protein  that  is  involved  in  regulating  the  transcription  of 
vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  and  a  number  of  other 
effectors  through  ubiquitination  of  hypoxia-inducible  factors  (HIF). 
Inactivation  of  VHL,  through  upregulation  of  VEGF  signaling,  pro-
motes tumor angiogenesis and growth, ultimately rendering clear cell 
RCC cells susceptible to antiangiogenesis therapy.

Large-scale  sequencing  efforts  have  helped  elucidate  recurrent 
patterns  of  genomic  evolution  that  correlate  with  distinct  clinical 
phenotypes, e.g., varying levels of aggressiveness or specific patterns of 
metastatic spread. For example, early loss of chromosome 9p appears 
to confer a high risk for early metastatic dissemination and correlates 
with poor cancer-specific survival.

A  growing  number  of  other  RCC  variants  are  well  defined  (see  
Table 85-2 for examples). For instance, up to 15% of RCCs are of the 
papillary  subtype,  with  several  subtypes  that  can  be  distinguished 
either by light microscopy or tumor genomics. For example, activating 
mutations in the MET oncogene or gain of chromosome 7 (where MET 
is located) are hallmark events of type 1 papillary RCC and considered

actionable  via  targeted  MET  inhibitors.  Tumors  of  the  less  common 
chromophobe subtype originate from the distal nephron. They are in 
part  driven  by  changes  in  mitochondrial  gene  function  and  typically 
characterized by aneuploidy with common loss of an entire chromo-
some copy for chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, and 17.
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Presenting  signs  and  symptoms  may  include  hematuria,  flank  or 
abdominal  pain,  and  a  palpable  mass.  Other  symptoms  are  fever, 
weight loss, anemia, and a varicocele. Tumors are, however, commonly 
detected  as  an  incidental  finding  on  a  radiograph.  Widespread  use 
of  radiologic  cross-sectional  imaging  (computed  tomography  [CT], 
magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI])  contributes  to  earlier  detection 
of  renal  masses  during  evaluation  for  other  medical  conditions.  The 
increasing  number  of  incidentally  discovered  low-stage  tumors  has 
contributed to an improved 5-year survival for patients with RCC and 
increased  use  of  nephron-sparing  surgery  (partial  nephrectomy).  A 
spectrum of paraneoplastic syndromes has been associated with these 
malignancies, including erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, nonmetastatic 
hepatic  dysfunction  (Stauffer’s  syndrome),  and  acquired  dysfibrino-
genemia. Erythrocytosis is noted at presentation in only about 3% of 
patients. Anemia, commonly a sign of more advanced disease, is more 
common.  Kidney  cancer  was  called  the  “internist’s  tumor”  since  it 
was often discovered from the initial presentation of a paraneoplastic 
syndrome. This was more common before the era of modern imaging, 
as was initial presentation by the classic triad of hematuria, flank pain, 
and a palpable abdominal mass.

The  standard  evaluation  of  patients  with  suspected  renal  tumors 
includes  a  CT  scan  of  the  abdomen  and  pelvis,  chest  radiograph,  and 
urine analysis. If metastatic disease is suspected from the chest radio-
graph, a CT of the chest is warranted. MRI is useful in evaluating the 

inferior vena cava in cases of suspected tumor involvement or invasion 
by thrombus, or when intravenous contrast administration given with 
CT  is  prohibited  by  impaired  renal  function.  In  clinical  practice,  any 
solid  renal  masses  should  be  considered  malignant  until  proven  oth-
erwise; a definitive diagnosis is required. If no metastases are demon-
strated, surgery is indicated, even if the renal vein or inferior vena cava is 
invaded. In small tumors (particularly those of clear cell variant) the risk 
of impending metastatic spread is lower and surgery can potentially be 
delayed. In that setting, a needle biopsy should be performed to confirm 
the underlying histology, and radiographic surveillance is indicated until 
the time of surgery. The differential diagnosis of a renal mass includes 
cysts,  benign  neoplasms  (adenoma,  angiomyolipoma,  oncocytoma), 
inflammatory lesions (pyelonephritis or abscesses), and other malignan-
cies originating in the kidney such as transitional cell carcinoma of the 
renal pelvis, sarcoma, lymphoma, and Wilms’ tumor or metastases from 
cancers originating in other organs. All of these are less common causes 
of renal masses than is RCC. The most common sites of distant metasta-
ses are the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, bone, and brain. These tumors may 
follow an unpredictable and protracted clinical course.
 ■ STAGING AND PROGNOSIS
Staging is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 
staging system (Fig. 85-1). Stage I tumors are ≤7 cm in greatest diameter 
and confined to the kidney, stage II tumors are >7 cm and confined to 
the  kidney,  stage  III  tumors  extend  through  the  renal  capsule  but  are 
confined to Gerota’s fascia, grossly infiltrate the renal vein, or involve 
regional lymph nodes (N1), and stage IV disease includes tumors that 
have  invaded  adjacent  organs  or  involve  nonregional  lymph  nodes  or 
distant metastases. Sixty-five percent of patients present with stage I or 
II disease, 15–20% with stage III, and 15–20% with stage IV. The 5-year 
survival rate is currently 75% across all RCCs, but varies greatly by stage.

Prognostic risk models are helpful for counseling patients diagnosed 
with metastatic disease and for anticipating survival rates when design-
ing a clinical trial. A widely used prognostic model for advanced dis-
ease, the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) 
risk  model,  incorporates  six  factors  shown  to  correlate  with  worse 
survival:  poor  performance  status,  low  hemoglobin  concentration, 
high  serum  calcium,  high  neutrophil  levels,  high  platelet  levels,  and 
<1-year  interval  from  diagnosis  to  systemic  treatment.  Patients  with 
zero risk factors had significantly longer median survival (43 months) 
than patients with one or two risk factors (22.5 months) and those with 
three to six risk factors (8 months) when treated with first-line angio-
genesis inhibitors (see below).

TREATMENT
Renal Cell Carcinoma 

LOCALIZED TUMOR
The  standard  management  for  stage  I  or  II  tumors  and  selected 
cases of stage III disease is radical or partial nephrectomy. A rad-
ical  nephrectomy  involves  en  bloc  removal  of  Gerota’s  fascia  and 
its  contents,  including  the  kidney,  and  commonly  the  ipsilateral 
adrenal gland and regional lymph nodes that appear abnormal on 
imaging or intraoperatively. Open, laparoscopic, or robotic surgical 
techniques may be used. The role of a template lymphadenectomy 
in  patients  without  apparent  lymphadenopathy  is  controversial. 
Extension  into  the  renal  vein  or  inferior  vena  cava  (stage  III 
disease)  does  not  preclude  resection,  which  would  then  include 
thrombectomy.

Nephron-sparing  approaches,  i.e.,  open  or  laparoscopic  partial 
nephrectomy, may be appropriate depending on the size and loca-
tion of the tumor. This approach is particularly relevant for patients 
with  solitary  kidneys,  bilateral  tumors,  or  chronic  renal  insuffi-
ciency but can also be applied electively to resect small masses for 
patients with normal kidney function. Radical nephrectomy carries 
a greater risk for chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular mor-
bidity and mortality.

Adjuvant  systemic  therapies,  including  cytokines  and  targeted 
agents, have been studied in randomized clinical trials, largely with 
negative  results,  and  the  standard  of  care  remains  active  surveil-
lance after nephrectomy. 

METASTATIC DISEASE
Surgery has a limited role for patients with metastatic disease. Long-
term survival may occur in patients who relapse with a solitary site

that  is  removed  (metastasectomy).  Nephrectomy  despite  presence 
of metastases (cytoreductive nephrectomy) is considered for care-
fully  selected  patients  with  stage  IV  disease.  One  indication  for 
this approach can be to alleviate pain or hemorrhage of a primary 
tumor.

Radiation therapy is used for palliation of bone or brain metasta-
ses. The type of radiotherapy most commonly used is external-beam 
therapy,  including  stereotactic  radiosurgery  and  other  forms  of 
image-guided radiotherapy.

Systemic therapy is the mainstay of care for metastatic disease. 
The  timing  of  initiating  such  treatment  should  be  carefully  con-
sidered;  some  patients  are  asymptomatic  at  diagnosis,  and  with 
indolent behavior, it may be best to document progression before 
initiating treatment.

Metastatic RCC is refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients 
are  treated  with  molecularly  targeted  agents,  including  targeted 
immunotherapies. Treatments are continued with noncurative intent 
while  tolerated  and  until  disease  progression  is  evident  on  cross-
sectional  imaging.  Outcomes  for  patients  with  metastatic  disease 
improved when increased understanding of underlying biology led 
to  the  successful  development  of  several  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(TKIs) targeting proangiogenic signaling through the VEGF recep-
tors as well as allosteric inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) signaling. Serial large-scale randomized trials demonstrated 
that  such  agents,  typically  orally  available,  could  be  administered 
sequentially and in combination. Pivotal studies, by design, defined 
a dedicated space for each regimen in treatment-naïve or pretreated 
patients (Table 85-3).

Targeted  immunotherapies  were  introduced  after  VEGF-  and 
mTOR-directed  agents  had  established  standards  of  care  in  the 
first-  and  second-line  setting.  Nivolumab,  a  checkpoint  inhibitor 
targeting PD-1, was compared to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus 
in a randomized trial in patients who had progressed on prior TKI 
therapy, challenging the standard approach in pretreated patients. 
Nivolumab demonstrated superior overall survival, positioning it as 
the new second-line agent of choice. Subsequently, immunotherapy 
combination regimens demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials 
conducted in treatment-naïve patients. In separate studies, two dou-
blets demonstrated survival benefit over standard sunitinib therapy 
and changed the standard of care for untreated metastatic clear cell 
RCC: nivolumab in combination with the CTLA-4-directed check-
point inhibitor ipilimumab proved superior to sunitinib in patients 
with  high-risk  features  per  the  IMDC  model,  achieving  complete 
radiographic  disappearance  of  cancer  in  >10%  of  patients  treated 
with  the  combination.  In  a  second  trial,  the  combination  of  the

TKI axitinib together with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab was 
superior to sunitinib alone in all-comers with untreated metastatic 
RCC, again with high response rates across all IMDC risk groups. 
In both trials, responses were long-lasting, with improved time to 
disease  progression  and  longer  overall  survival  for  combination 
regimens. Additional trials are ongoing to fortify the new standard 
of combination therapy in the first line.

With  an  ever-growing  number  of  approved  options  directed 
toward  different  molecular  targets,  biomarkers  are  urgently  needed 
to  help  individualize  therapeutic  choices  and  to  gain  insight  as  to 
whether  and  why  treatments  are  working.  Although  a  multitude  of 
candidate biomarkers have been investigated for their predictive value 
in metastatic RCC, none have been validated for clinical use to date.

Projected overall survival in patients starting systemic therapies 
for  newly  diagnosed  metastatic  disease  has  tripled  over  the  past 
15–20  years;  this  can  largely  be  attributed  to  the  successful  drug 
developments discussed here.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Worldwide, over 400,000 patients are diagnosed each year with malig-
nant  tumors  arising  from  the  kidney,  resulting  in  >175,000  deaths 
annually. Kidney cancer is the 10th most common cancer in men and 
the 15th most common cancer in women. Higher incidence is observed 
in developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Europe, 
Australia, New Zealand, and Uruguay. Relatively low rates are reported 
in Southeast Asia and Africa. The incidence of kidney cancer has been 
steadily  increasing  over  the  past  four  decades.  Mortality  trends  have 
stabilized in Europe and the United States, but not in less developed 
countries.  This  is  likely  related  to  differences  in  access  to  optimal 
therapies. Treatment guidelines for both localized and metastatic renal 
cancer are similar between U.S. and European documents and contin-
gent on the access to adequate health care and availability of targeted 
drugs to treat metastases.

86 Cancer of the Bladder  
and Urinary Tract
Noah M. Hahn

GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
Within  the  United  States,  urothelial  carcinomas  of  the  bladder  and 
urinary  tract  are  most  closely  related  to  tobacco  smoking  history. 
However,  within  developing  countries,  water  supplies  contaminated 
with  arsenic  or  schistosomiasis  parasites  also  are  major  carcinogenic 
contributors.

INTRODUCTION
Cancers of the urinary tract including the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, 
and urethra occur frequently, and they represent the second most com-
mon  class  of  genitourinary  cancers.  Bladder  cancer  alone  represents 
the sixth most common cancer diagnosis annually in the United States 
with 81,400 new cases and 17,980 deaths every year. Because cancers 
of the renal pelvis are often lumped in with all kidney cancers, the true 
incidence and mortality from nonbladder urinary tract cancers are less 
precise. While less frequent than bladder cancer, an additional 20,000 
new  cases  and  5000  deaths  are  estimated  every  year.  An  accelerated 
understanding  of  the  molecular  underpinnings  of  bladder  and  uri-
nary tract cancer biology has led to a significant increase in urothelial 
cancer clinical trials resulting in U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)  approval  of  multiple  new  therapeutic  agents  since  2016  with 
more expected to follow. This chapter reviews the established, current, 
and emerging evidence that serves as the basis for the rapidly evolving 
standards of care for patients with bladder and urinary tract cancers.
 ■ CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
Bladder  cancer  typically  affects  older  patients  with  a  median  age  at 
diagnosis  of  73  years.  Males  are  four  times  more  frequently  affected 
than females. Similarly, bladder cancer is more common in Caucasians 
than in Asian patients. Inheritable germline genetic risk factors have 
been identified in up to one-seventh of patients with bladder or urinary 
tract cancers. However, a singular germline genetic alteration has not

been observed in a majority of these cases, and the impact of germline 
genetic alterations on family members of urothelial cancer patients is 
uncertain.  Patients  with  defects  in  mismatch  repair  genes  leading  to

familial cancer Lynch syndrome are at particular risk of upper urinary 
tract cancers of the renal pelvis and ureter. Additionally, patients with 
Cowden disease (PTEN mutations) or retinoblastoma (RB1 mutations) 
are at increased risk for developing bladder cancer.

Historically, associations have existed between environmental toxic 
exposures and higher rates of developing bladder cancer. Carcinogenic 
agents associated with increased risk of bladder cancer have included 
the  aromatic  amines  benzidine  and  beta-naphthylamine  that  can  be 
present in industrial dyes as well as arsenic that can be found in some 
drinking  water  supplies  in  underdeveloped  countries.  Other  chemi-
cals in the leather, paint, rubber, textiles, and printing industries have 
been  associated  with  bladder  cancer.  Associations  with  exposures  to 
hair dyes and hair sprays in workers in the hairstyling field have been 
suggested. Additionally, concern has been raised regarding use of the 
antidiabetic medication, pioglitazone, and bladder cancer risk. Exten-
sive  reviews  and  meta-analyses  have  produced  differing  conclusions. 
The data suggest a small risk of bladder cancer from long-term piogli-
tazone use, which has led to inclusion of bladder cancer risk within the 
pioglitazone prescribing information. An association between chronic 
inflammatory  states  and  the  development  of  squamous  bladder  can-
cer  clearly  exists  in  underdeveloped  countries  in  patients  chronically 
infected  with  the  parasitic  disease  schistosomiasis  and  in  paraplegic 
patients with chronic indwelling catheters. Above and beyond each of 
these associations, however, smoking of tobacco products (cigarettes, 
cigars,  pipes,  etc.)  remains  the  overwhelming  leading  risk  factor  for 
development of bladder cancer. Among new bladder cancer diagnoses, 
90% of cases occur in current or former smokers. Toxicologists have 
estimated  that  >70  confirmed  carcinogenic  toxins  are  present  within 
tobacco smoke. It is estimated that one-third of bladder cancer cases 
could be prevented through simple modification of lifestyle choices, in 
particular cessation of smoking.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSTIC 
WORKUP
Occasionally, patients will present with flank pain in association with 
an upper tract renal pelvis or ureter cancer or due to hydronephrosis 
in  association  with  a  bladder  tumor  obstructing  the  orifice  of  the 
ureter within the bladder. Only in rare cases do patients present with 
significant  cachexia  and  widespread  metastatic  disease.  For  most 
patients,  painless  hematuria  (either  gross  or  microscopic)  represents 
the  initial  manifestation  of  an  underlying  urinary  tract  cancer.  In 
females,  hematuria  due  to  malignancy  can  often  be  mistaken  for  a 
urinary  tract  infection  or  menstrual  bleeding.  While  treatment  with 
antibiotics is warranted if a concurrent urinary tract infection is noted 
on  initial  urinalysis,  persistent  hematuria  requires  further  workup. 
Painless hematuria in males is almost always abnormal and should be 
worked up. Initial investigations in patients of either sex should include 
urine  cytology  and  visual  examination  of  the  bladder  by  cystoscopy. 
Cytology  is  successful  in  identifying  cancer  in  only  50%  of  individ-
uals  with  high-grade  bladder  cancers.  In  addition  to  urine  cytology, 
radiographic evaluation of the kidneys and upper urinary tract by CT 
urogram  should  be  performed.  Because  of  the  increased  sensitivity 
and reduced IV contrast loads, CT urograms have largely replaced IV 
pyelograms as the preferred upper urinary tract imaging modality. A 
magnetic resonance (MR) urogram may be substituted in patients with 
poor renal function. Additional diagnostic testing of the urine to assess 
for  cancer-associated  chromosomal  changes  by  fluorescent  in  situ 
hybridization,  increased  levels  of  nuclear  mitotic  proteins,  increased 
bladder tumor–associated antigens, or higher levels of staining on cells 
shed by the bladder may identify some cancers missed by traditional 
cytology testing. However, they may also produce abnormal results in 
patients who do not have cancer. For now, these adjunct molecular tests 
are primarily utilized in detecting recurrent cancer in patients with a 
prior diagnosis of urinary tract cancer. Small tumors, particularly flat 
noninvasive tumors of the bladder, may be detected at higher rates with 

the  use  of  blue  light  cystoscopy  or  narrow-band  imaging  cystoscopy. 
Both blue light and narrow-band imaging cystoscopies are now used 
routinely  in  the  monitoring  of  patients  with  bladder  cancer.  For 
patients with no bladder abnormalities in whom upper tract tumors are 
suspected, visualization of the upper urinary tracts and renal pelvises 
should be performed by ureteroscopy or retrograde pyelography.

In  all  patients  with  abnormalities  noted  in  the  bladder  or  upper 
urinary tracts, complete endoscopic resection for histologic diagnosis 
and staging should be performed when possible via either transurethral 
resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or endoscopic resection of upper 
tract tumors.

 ■ HISTOLOGY
Urothelial  carcinoma,  often  called  transitional  cell  carcinoma  in 
the  past,  is  the  most  common  urinary  tract  cancer  histology  and  is 
observed in ~90% of cases. Squamous, glandular, micropapillary, plas-
macytoid, sarcomatoid, and other variant features can often be found 
in  portions  of  urothelial  carcinoma  tumors;  however,  pure  variant 
histologies are rare. The presence of some variant histologies includ-
ing  micropapillary  and  plasmacytoid  has  been  associated  with  worse 
surgical  outcomes  compared  to  urothelial  carcinoma.  Nonurothelial 
variant  histologies  including  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  adenocarci-
noma, small-cell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma collectively account 
for  ≤10%  of  urinary  tract  tumors.  Examples  of  traditional  urothelial 
carcinoma and some of the variant histologies are shown in Fig. 86-1.

 ■ MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Clinically, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder displays a biphasic phe-
notype characterized by (1) low-grade papillary tumors that frequently 
recur but rarely invade or metastasize and (2) high-grade sometimes 
flat  tumors  that  invade  early  leading  to  lethal  metastatic  disease.  In 
both  of  these  phenotypes,  loss  of  portions  of  chromosomes  9q  and 
9p by loss of heterozygosity is an early molecular event, whose exact 
significance is not clear. Potential candidate regulatory genes in these 
genomic regions include CDNK2A, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhib-
itor,  and  TSC1,  a  gene  encoding  hamartin  mutated  in  tuberous  scle-
rosis.  Early  investigations  have  demonstrated  that  low-grade  tumors 
are  characterized  by  alterations  in  the  RAS/RAF  signaling  pathway 
with  activating  FGFR3  mutations  or  gene  fusions  present  in  60–80% 
of patients. In contrast, the high-grade invasive phenotype is notable 
for early deleterious mutations in TP53 and RB1, alterations in CDH1 
(E-cadherin),  and  increased  expression  of  VEGFR2.  In  urothelial 
carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter, 10–20% of cases may be asso-
ciated with Lynch syndrome hereditary defects in the MLH1, MSH2, 
or  MSH6  mismatch  repair  genes,  leading  to  microsatellite  instability 
and frequent DNA mutations. Testing for germline mutations in these 
genes is recommended in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial 
carcinoma  under  the  age  of  60  at  diagnosis,  with  a  first-degree  rela-
tive  with  a  Lynch  syndrome–associated  cancer  diagnosed  under  the 
age of 50, or with two first-degree relatives with a Lynch syndrome– 
associated cancer regardless of the age at diagnosis.

As genomic analysis technologies have improved, so has our under-
standing  of  the  molecular  biology  unique  to  urothelial  carcinoma. 
In 2017, the full bladder cancer results of The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) project were published. This effort comprehensively analyzed 
gene  mutations,  fusions,  expression,  copy  number  variations,  meth-
ylation,  and  microRNA  across  the  genome  of  patients  with  bladder 
urothelial carcinoma treated with surgery. Key findings from this effort 
include (1) genomic alterations in genes (e.g., FGFR3, EGFR, ERBB2, 
ERBB3,  PIK3CA,  TSC1,  etc.)  targetable  by  currently  approved  drugs 
or  drugs  in  development  in  71%  of  patients;  (2)  genomic  alterations 
in  chromatin-modifying  genes  (KMT2D,  KDM6A,  KMT2C,  EP300, 
CREBBP, etc.) in the majority of patients; (3) hypermethylation with 
epigenetic silencing of gene expression in one-fourth of patients; and 
(4)  the  identification  by  RNA  sequencing  of  five  distinct  intrinsic 
molecular  subtypes  (luminal  papillary,  luminal  infiltrated,  luminal, 
basal squamous, and neuronal) closely resembling luminal and basal 
subclassifications  of  breast  cancers.  These  bladder  TCGA  findings 
have  led  to  clinical  trial  designs  enriching  for  patients  with  specific

 ■ STAGING AND OUTCOMES BY STAGE
The staging of bladder cancer is dependent on the depth of invasion 
within  the  bladder  wall,  involvement  of  lymph  nodes,  and  spread  to 
surrounding  and  distant  organs  as  depicted  in  Fig.  86-2.  Approxi-
mately 75% of bladder cancer presents with non–muscle-invasive blad-
der cancer (NMIBC), 18% with disease invading into or through the 
muscular wall of the bladder, and only 3% presenting with metastatic 
spread  to  distant  organs.  NMIBC  is  defined  by  tumors  that  involve 
only the immediate epithelial layer of cells (carcinoma in situ [CIS] and 
Ta) or that only penetrate into the connective tissue below the urothe-
lium  (T1)  but  not  into  the  muscular  layer  known  as  the  muscularis 
propria. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is defined by tumors 
that invade into the muscularis propria (T2), through the muscularis 
propria  to  involve  the  surrounding  serosa  (T3),  or  into  immediately 
adjacent pelvic organs such as the rectum, prostate, vagina, or cervix 
(T4). Lymph node staging is classified according to involvement of a 
solitary  node  within  the  true  pelvis  (N1),  two  nodes  involved  in  the 
true pelvis (N2), or involvement of the common iliac nodes (N3). Any 
disease that has spread beyond the common iliac nodes is considered 
metastatic (M1). The staging of bladder cancer is driven primarily by 
the  T  stage  of  the  tumor,  with  stages  0a–II  defined  entirely  by  the  T 
stage  in  the  absence  of  nodal  or  metastatic  disease.  Involvement  of 

regional  lymph  nodes  in  the  true  pelvis  or  along  the  common  iliac 
artery qualifies as stage III disease, whereas involvement of any distant 
metastases qualifies as stage IV disease. Clinical outcomes of patients 
with  bladder  cancer  correlate  closely  with  staging  at  diagnosis  with 
5-year  overall  survival  rates  of  70–90%  for  disease  confined  to  the 
bladder  (stage  I–II),  36–50%  for  disease  that  penetrates  through  the 
bladder or has spread to regional lymph nodes (stage III), and only 5% 
for disease extending to metastatic sites (stage IV).

 ■ TREATMENT APPROACHES
Early-Stage  Disease  For  NMIBC,  removal  of  all  visible  tumors 
by  TURBT  in  the  operating  room  is  considered  the  mainstay  of 
surgical  treatment.  Risk  of  recurrence  can  be  classified  as  low,  inter-
mediate,  or  high  depending  on  the  presence  of  features  summarized 
in  Table  86-1.  For  patients  with  low-risk  disease,  meta-analyses 
have  demonstrated  a  12%  reduction  in  early  relapses  when  a  single 
chemotherapy  treatment  of  mitomycin  C,  epirubicin,  or  gemcitabine 
was  instilled  directly  into  the  bladder  (intravesical  therapy)  within  
24  hours  of  the  TURBT.  For  patients  with  intermediate-  or 
high-risk  tumors,  weekly  intravesical  instillations  for  6  con-
secutive  weeks  of  the  attenuated  mycobacterium  strain  known  as 
Bacille  Calmette-Guérin  (BCG)  reduce  the  risk  of  recurrence  at  
12  months  from  56  to  29%.  In  addition,  BCG  treatment  has  been 
shown to decrease the rate of progression to MIBC by 27%. Intravesical

BCG is generally well tolerated. Side effects can include dysuria, uri-
nary frequency, bladder spasms, hematuria, and, in rare cases (<5%), 
a systemic inflammatory response that can mimic disseminated BCG 
infection.  Following  a  6-week  induction  BCG  schedule,  additional 
maintenance  BCG  treatments  given  according  to  the  Southwest 
Oncology Group schedule further reduce the risk of recurrent NMIBC 
compared  to  induction  BCG  alone.  In  patients  with  NMIBC  that 
recurs  long  after  initial  BCG  treatment,  a  repeat  course  of  BCG  can 
be  considered.  For  patients  with  recurrence  after  a  second  adequate 
course  of  BCG  or  with  relapsed  NMIBC  within  6  months  of  initial 
BCG  exposure,  surgical  removal  of  the  entire  bladder  by  cystectomy 
is  recommended  due  to  the  high  risk  of  progression  to  MIBC  and 
potentially metastatic disease. For patients who are not fit enough for 
or  who  refuse  cystectomy,  non-BCG  alternative  intravesical  agents

Upper Tract Disease 
In patients with 
urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis or 
ureter,  endoscopic  tissue  acquisition  and 
staging are more challenging than primary 
tumors  located  in  the  bladder.  Tumors 
possessing all of the following are consid-
ered  low  risk:  solitary  tumor,  low  grade, 
size <1 cm, and no invasive component on 
imaging. Low-risk tumors can successfully 
be  treated  by  laser  ureteroscopic  ablation 
or  surgical  resection  and  reanastomosis 
of  the  remaining  ureter  ends  in  tumors 
that  cannot  be  successfully  eradicated 
endoscopically.

Muscle-Invasive  Disease 
In  patients 
with  urothelial  carcinoma  of  the  bladder 
that invades into or through the muscularis 
propria but with no evidence of metastatic 
spread,  more  aggressive  therapy  options 
summarized in Table 86-2 are required to 
achieve cure. In carefully selected patients 
with no evidence of CIS or hydronephrosis, 
bladder-sparing  combined-modality  ther-
apy  with  concurrent  chemotherapy  and 
radiation  can  achieve  cure  in  ~65%  of 
patients.  Various  chemotherapy  regimens 
have  been  utilized  in  combination  with 
radiation  including  cisplatin,  carboplatin, 
5-fluorouracil,  mitomycin  C,  paclitaxel, 
and  gemcitabine.  It  is  important  to  note 
that  a  maximal  debulking  of  all  visible 
tumor by TURBT is required prior to initiation of combined-modality 
therapy.  In  patients  who  achieve  a  complete  response  to  combined-
modality  therapy,  regular  cystoscopic  monitoring  of  the  bladder  is 
required  with  salvage  cystectomy  offered  to  patients  who  develop 
MIBC in follow-up.

In a similar fashion, bladder-sparing partial cystectomy can be per-
formed in a very small subset of MIBC patients. The ideal patient for 
partial cystectomy is the patient with a solitary, clinical T2 urothelial 
carcinoma in the dome of the bladder. In such patients, the tumor and 
immediate surrounding urothelium can be resected with reconstruc-
tion  of  the  remaining  bladder  to  maintain  near  physiologic  urinary 
function.

In the majority of patients, however, resection of the entire bladder 
is required. In males, a cystoprostatectomy with removal of the bladder, 
prostate, and pelvic lymph nodes is performed, whereas in females, an 
anterior exenteration with removal of the bladder, uterus, ovaries, cer-
vix, and pelvic lymph nodes is performed. With the bladder removed, 
three  options  exist  to  reroute  the  urine  outflow.  In  an  ileostomy,  the 
bilateral  ureters  are  connected  to  a  portion  of  ileum  that  is  brought 
through an incision in the abdominal wall to create a stoma that drains 
urine into an affixed bag outside of the body. In a continent urinary 
reservoir or “Indiana pouch,” the ureters are connected to a portion of 
ileum that has been separated on both ends from the rest of the small-
bowel transit to form a urinary reservoir. The remaining small bowel 
is reanastomosed, and the urinary reservoir is brought up just beneath 
the abdominal wall muscles with patients catheterizing the urinary res-
ervoir several times per day via a small stoma tract. Last, in a neoblad-
der, the same urinary reservoir described previously is brought down 
into the pelvis and is anastomosed to the remaining urethra to provide 
the opportunity to the patient to void urine through the urethra. The 
choice  of  which  urinary  reconstruction  to  perform  is  affected  not 
only by patient choice but also by anatomic tumor considerations and

urologist experience with each procedure. Regardless of the type of sur-
gery performed, all patients undergo a significant catabolic change in 
their metabolism following removal of the bladder. While many MIBC 
patients are affected by weight loss preoperatively, it is not uncommon 
for postcystectomy patients to lose an additional 10–15 lb in the first 
month postoperatively. In addition, patients can experience long-term 
nutritional changes such as low B12 levels due to alterations in small-
bowel physiology caused by all of the urinary diversion options.

Despite  aggressive  surgery,  only  half  of  patients  undergoing  cys-
tectomy  are  cured  by  surgery  alone.  Therefore,  many  clinical  trials 
have investigated the role of systemic chemotherapy before (neoadju-
vant) or after (adjuvant) surgery. Meta-analyses have shown a 5–10% 
absolute overall survival advantage when combination chemotherapy 
regimens  utilizing  cisplatin  have  been  used  before  surgery.  A  similar 
benefit  exists  with  cisplatin-based  combination  chemotherapy  given 
after surgery. However, the data in the adjuvant setting are based on 
smaller,  older  trials.  Furthermore,  in  the  postoperative  setting,  some 
patients may not recover sufficiently from their surgery within a time 
frame  optimal  for  chemotherapy  administration.  Importantly,  non–
cisplatin-containing  chemotherapy  regimens  have  proven  inferior  to 
cisplatin-containing  regimens.  Therefore,  if  patients  are  not  suitable 
candidates  for  cisplatin  administration  due  to  poor  functional  status 
or  comorbidities  (e.g.,  poor  renal  function),  patients  should  proceed 
directly to surgery and forego neoadjuvant therapy.

For patients with high-risk urothelial carcinoma of the upper uri-
nary  tract,  resection  of  the  kidney  and  ureter  (including  the  ureter 
bladder  cuff)  by  nephroureterectomy  is  preferred.  Segmental  ureter-
ectomy may be appropriate in patients with decreased renal function 
in  which  nephron-sparing  outcomes  are  critical  to  prevent  the  need 
for dialysis. Similarly, in CIS patients, administration of BCG therapy 
via  a  nephrostomy  tube  can  be  considered  to  preserve  intact  renal 
function.  The  use  of  cisplatin-based  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  has 
been associated with a pathologic complete response at surgery of 14% 
in  upper  tract  urothelial  carcinoma  patients.  Similarly,  in  the  post-
nephroureterectomy  setting,  adjuvant  platinum-based  chemotherapy 
(carboplatin or cisplatin) reduced recurrence rates by 55% compared to 
surgery alone. The use of perioperative chemotherapy either before or 
after surgery is now recommended for upper tract urothelial carcinoma 
patients in national guidelines.

Metastatic Disease  For  patients  with  metastatic  urothelial  carci-
noma  regardless  of  primary  tumor  origin,  systemic  chemotherapy  is 
the most established standard of care. In a randomized phase 3 clinical 

trial,  the  combination  of  methotrexate,  vinblastine,  doxorubicin,  and 
cisplatin  (MVAC)  demonstrated  an  improvement  in  median  overall 
survival from 8.2 to 12.5 months compared to single-agent cisplatin. In 
a head-to-head randomized phase 3 clinical trial, the combination of 
cisplatin and gemcitabine (CG) demonstrated similar overall survival 
compared  to  MVAC  with  a  more  favorable  side  effect  profile.  Since 
2000,  treatment  with  either  MVAC  or  CG  has  remained  a  standard 
first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma 
with  adequate  renal  function  and  functional  status  suitable  for  cis-
platin  therapy.  For  patients  with  lymph  node–only  metastases  and 
good  functional  status,  cure  is  achieved  in  15–20%  of  such  patients. 
Unfortunately,  only  ~5%  of  metastatic  patients  fulfill  both  these 
criteria.  Furthermore,  approximately  half  of  patients  with  urothelial 
carcinoma  have  renal  insufficiency,  comorbidities,  or  frail  functional 
status,  and  are  not  candidates  for  cisplatin  treatment.  In  cisplat-
in-ineligible patients, carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens have 
historically been used with median overall survival rates decreased to 
9.3  months.  Agents  inhibiting  the  immune  checkpoint  programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
pathways  have  become  additional  standard  options  for  both  front-
line  chemotherapy-naive  (atezolizumab,  pembrolizumab),  front-line 
maintenance  (avelumab),  and  second-line  postplatinum  (pembroli-
zumab,  nivolumab,  and  avelumab)  metastatic  urothelial  carcinoma 
patients.  Although  these  agents  only  result  in  tumor  responses  in 
10–30%  of  patients,  they  have  been  approved  due  to  their  improved 
safety profiles compared to traditional chemotherapy options and the 
prolonged  durability  of  some  tumor  responses.  These  agents  aim  to 
reactivate a patient’s own immune system to recognize and eliminate 
their cancer. As such, their unique side effect profile is characterized 
by immune-related toxicities that are rare but can be severe and may 
include  colitis,  pneumonitis,  hepatitis,  nephritis,  myocarditis,  rash, 
hypothyroidism, Guillain-Barré syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytope-
nia purpura, and adrenal insufficiency.

In  patients  with  activating  tumor  fibroblast  growth  factor  2  or  3 
(FGFR2/3)  mutations  or  fusions  with  progressive  disease  following 
platinum-based  therapy,  the  oral  FGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor 
erdafitinib  is  another  standard  option  resulting  in  tumor  responses 
in 32% of patients with a median duration of response of 5.4 months. 
Additionally,  the  nectin-4–targeting  antibody-drug  conjugate  enfor-
tumab  vedotin  provides  an  additional  standard  option  for  patients 
with progression after both platinum-based therapy and PD-1/PD-L1 
immune  checkpoint  therapy  independent  of  tumor  mutation  status. 
Tumor  responses  are  observed  in  44%  of  patients,  including  patients 
with liver metastases, with a median response duration of 7.6 months. 
Additional novel urothelial carcinoma therapeutics are under ongoing 
investigation.

PART 4Oncology and Hematology87 Benign and Malignant 
Diseases of the Prostate
Howard I. Scher, James A. Eastham

Benign  and  malignant  changes  in  the  prostate  increase  with  age. 
Autopsies of men in the eighth decade of life show hyperplastic changes 
in >90% and malignant changes in >70% of individuals. The high prev-
alence of these diseases among the elderly, who often have competing 
causes of morbidity and mortality, mandates a risk-adapted approach 
to diagnosis and treatment. This can be achieved by considering these 
diseases  as  a  series  of  states.  Each  state  represents  a  distinct  clinical 
milestone for which therapy(ies) may be recommended based on dis-
ease extent, current symptoms, the risk of developing symptoms, or the 
risk of death from disease in relation to death from other causes within 
a  given  time  frame.  For  benign  proliferative  disorders,  symptoms 
of  bladder  outlet  obstruction  and  potential  complications  including 
urinary retention and urinary tract infection are weighed against the 
side effects and complications of medical or surgical intervention. For 
prostate malignancies, the likelihood that a clinically significant cancer 
is present in the gland and the concomitant risk of symptoms or death 
from cancer are balanced against the morbidities of the recommended 
treatments and preexisting comorbidities.

ANATOMY AND PATHOLOGY
The prostate is in the pelvis and is adjacent to the rectum, the bladder, 
the periprostatic and dorsal vein complexes, the neurovascular bundles 
that are responsible for erectile function, and the urinary sphincter that 
is responsible for passive urinary control. The prostate is composed of 
branching  tubuloalveolar  glands  arranged  in  lobules  surrounded  by 
fibromuscular stroma. The acinar unit includes an epithelial compart-
ment made up of epithelial, basal, and neuroendocrine cells separated 
by  a  basement  membrane  and  a  stromal  compartment  that  includes 
fibroblasts  and  smooth-muscle  cells.  Prostate-specific  antigen  (PSA) 
and  prostatic  acid  phosphatase  (PAP)  are  produced  in  the  epithelial 
cells. Both prostate epithelial cells and stromal cells express androgen 
receptors (ARs) and depend on androgens for growth. Testosterone, the 
major circulating androgen, is converted by the enzyme 5α-reductase 
to dihydrotestosterone in the gland.

The  periurethral  portion  of  the  gland  increases  in  size  during 
puberty and after the age of 55 years due to the growth of nonmalig-
nant cells in the transition zone of the prostate that surrounds the ure-
thra. Most cancers develop in the peripheral zone, and cancers in this 
location may be palpated during a digital rectal examination (DRE).

PROSTATE CANCER
The  American  Cancer  Society’s  estimates  for  prostate  cancer  in  the 
United  States  for  2021  are  ~248,530  new  prostate  cancer  cases  and 
~34,130 deaths from prostate cancer. The absolute number of prostate 
cancer  deaths  has  decreased  in  the  past  10  years,  attributed  by  some 
to  the  widespread  use  of  PSA-based  detection  strategies.  However,  
the paradox of management is that although 1 in 8 men will eventually 
be diagnosed with prostate cancer and the disease remains the second 
leading cause of cancer deaths in men, only 1 man in 41 with prostate 
cancer will die of his disease.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Epidemiologic  studies  show  that  the  risk  of  being  diagnosed  with 
prostate cancer increases 2.5-fold if one first-degree relative is affected 
and  fivefold  if  two  or  more  are  affected.  Current  estimates  are  that 
40%  of  early-onset  and  5–10%  of  all  prostate  cancers  are  hereditary. 
Prostate  cancer  affects  ethnic  groups  differently.  Matched  for  age,  
African-American males have a higher incidence and present at a more 
advanced stage with higher-grade, more aggressive cancers. Genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >40 prostate cancer 
susceptibility loci that are estimated to explain up to 25% of prostate

cancer risk. Among the genes implicated in variations in incidence and 
outcome are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D 
receptor in African Americans and variants in the AR, CYP3A4, both 
involved in the deactivation of testosterone, as well as CYP17, which is 
involved in steroid biosynthesis. One early change is hypermethylation 
of the GSTP1 gene promoter, which leads to loss of function of a gene 
that  detoxifies  carcinogens.  The  finding  that  many  prostate  cancers 
develop adjacent to a lesion termed proliferative inflammatory atrophy 
(PIA) suggests a role for inflammation.

The  prevalence  of  autopsy-detected  cancers  is  similar  around  the 
world,  while  the  incidence  of  clinical  disease  varies.  Thus,  environ-
mental and dietary factors may play a role in prostate cancer growth 
and progression. High consumption of dietary fats, such as α-linoleic 
acid or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that form when red meats are 
cooked, is believed to increase risk. Like breast cancer in Asian women, 
the  risk  of  prostate  cancer  in  Asian  men  increases  when  they  move 
to  Western  environments.  Protective  factors  include  consumption  of 
the  isoflavonoid  genistein  (which  inhibits  5α-reductase),  cruciferous 
vegetables with isothiocyanate sulforaphane, lycopene found in toma-
toes, and inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis (e.g., statin drugs). Not 
smoking, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy body weight may 
reduce the risk of progression.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT BY CLINICAL STATE
The  prostate  cancer  continuum—from  the  appearance  of  a  preneo-
plastic and invasive lesion that is localized to the gland, to a metastatic 
lesion causing symptoms and, ultimately, mortality—can span decades. 
To  limit  overdiagnosis  of  clinically  insignificant  cancers  and  for  dis-
ease  management  in  general,  competing  risks  are  considered  in  the 
context of a series of clinical states (Fig. 87-1). The states are defined 
operationally  based  on  whether  or  not  a  cancer  diagnosis  has  been 
established  and,  for  those  with  a  diagnosis,  the  state  of  the  primary 
tumor  (treated  vs  untreated),  whether  or  not  metastases  are  detect-
able on imaging studies, and the measured level of testosterone in the 
blood. With this approach, an individual resides in only one state and 
remains in that state until he has progressed. At each assessment, the 
decision to offer treatment and the specific form of treatment are based 
on the presence or absence of cancer-related symptoms, and if absent, 
the risk posed by the cancer relative to competing causes of morbidity 
and mortality that may be present in that individual. It follows that the 
more advanced the disease, the greater is the need for treatment.

For those without a cancer diagnosis, the decision to undergo testing 
to detect a cancer is based on the individual’s estimated life expectancy 
and, separately, the probability that a clinically significant cancer may 
be present. For those with a prostate cancer diagnosis, the clinical states 
model  considers  the  probability  of  developing  symptoms  or  dying 
from the disease. Thus, a patient with a localized tumor that has been 
surgically removed remains in the state of localized disease if the PSA 
remains undetectable. The time within a state then becomes a measure 
of the efficacy of an intervention, though the effect may not be assess-
able for years. Because many men with active cancer are not at risk for 
developing  metastases,  symptoms,  or  death,  the  clinical  states  model 
allows  a  distinction  between  cure—the  elimination  of  all  cancer  cells, 
the primary therapeutic objective of treatment for most cancers—and 
cancer control, by which the tempo of the illness is determined to be so 
slow or has been altered by treatment to the point where it is unlikely 
to cause symptoms, to metastasize, or to shorten a patient’s life expec-
tancy.  Importantly,  from  a  patient  standpoint,  both  outcomes  can  be 
considered  equivalent  therapeutically  assuming  the  patient  has  not 
experienced symptoms of the disease or the treatment needed to con-
trol it. Even when a recurrence is documented, immediate therapy is 
not always necessary. Rather, as at the time of diagnosis, the need for 
intervention  is  based  on  the  tempo  of  the  illness  as  it  unfolds  in  the 
individual, relative to the risk-to-benefit ratio of the intervention being 
considered.

randomized  chemoprevention  trials  have  established  5α-reductase 
inhibitors  (5ARIs)  as  the  predominant  therapy  to  reduce  the  future 
risk  of  a  prostate  cancer  diagnosis.  The  Prostate  Cancer  Prevention 
Trial  (PCPT),  in  which  men  aged  >55  years  received  placebo  or  the 
5ARI  finasteride,  which  inhibits  the  type  1  isoform,  showed  a  25% 
(95%  confidence  interval  19–31%)  reduction  in  prostate  cancer  inci-
dence  from  24%  with  placebo  to  18%  with  finasteride.  In  REDUCE 
(Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events trial), a reduction 
in incidence from 25% with placebo to 20% with dutasteride was found  
(p = .001). Dutasteride inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 5ARI iso-
forms. While both studies met their endpoint, there was concern that 
most of the cancers that were “prevented” were low risk. Neither drug is 
approved for prostate cancer prevention. In comparison, the Selenium 
and  Vitamin  E  Cancer  Prevention  Trial  (SELECT),  which  enrolled  
African-American  men  aged  ≥50  years  and  others  aged  ≥55  years, 
showed no difference in cancer incidence in patients receiving vitamin 
E (4.6%) or selenium (4.9%) alone or in combination (4.6%) relative to 
placebo (4.4%). A similar lack of benefit for vitamin E, vitamin C, and 
selenium was seen in the Physicians Health Study II.

Early Detection and Diagnosis  The decision to pursue a diagno-
sis of prostate cancer must balance the benefit from detecting and treat-
ing  clinically  significant  cancers  that,  left  untreated,  would  adversely 
affect a patient’s quality and duration of life, against the morbidity asso-
ciated with the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignifi-
cant cancers that are highly prevalent in the general population. The 
balance is best approached through shared decision-making between 
the patient and physician. Considerations for whether to pursue a diag-
nosis include symptoms, an abnormal DRE, or more typically, a change 
in or an elevated serum PSA. Genetic risk is also considered.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  The DRE focuses on prostate size, consis-
tency,  and  abnormalities  within  or  beyond  the  gland.  Many  cancers 
occur in the peripheral zone and may be palpated on DRE. Carcinomas 
are  characteristically  hard,  nodular,  and  irregular,  while  induration 
may  also  be  due  to  benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  (BPH)  or  calculi. 
Overall, 20–25% of men with an abnormal DRE have prostate cancer.

PROSTATE-SPECIFIC  ANTIGEN  PSA  (kallikrein-related  peptidase  3; 
KLK3) is a kallikrein-related serine protease that causes liquefaction of 
seminal coagulum. It is produced by both nonmalignant and malignant 
epithelial  cells  and,  as  such,  is  prostate-specific,  not  prostate  cancer–
specific.  Serum  levels  of  PSA  may  increase  from  prostatitis,  BPH,  or 

prostate cancer. Serum levels are not significantly affected by the DRE. 
PSA circulating in the blood is inactive and mainly occurs as a complex 
with  the  protease  inhibitor  α1-antichymotrypsin  and  as  free  (unbound) 
PSA forms. The formation of complexes between PSA, α2-macroglobulin, 
or  other  protease  inhibitors  is  less  significant.  Free  PSA  is  rapidly 
eliminated from the blood by glomerular filtration with an estimated 
half-life of 12–18 h. Elimination of PSA bound to α1-antichymotrypsin 
is slow (estimated half-life of 1–2 weeks) as it, too, is largely cleared by 
the kidneys. Levels should be undetectable after about 6 weeks if the 
prostate has been completely removed (radical prostatectomy).

PSA testing was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) in 1994 for early detection of prostate cancer, and the wide-
spread use of the test has played a significant role in the proportion of 
men diagnosed with early-stage cancers: >70–80% of newly diagnosed 
cancers  are  clinically  organ  confined.  The  level  of  PSA  in  blood  is 
strongly associated with the risk and outcome of prostate cancer. A sin-
gle PSA measured at age 60 is associated (area under the curve [AUC] 
of 0.90) with lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer. Most (90%) 
prostate  cancer  deaths  occur  among  men  with  PSA  levels  in  the  top 
quartile (>2 ng/mL), although only a minority of men with PSA >2 ng/
mL will develop lethal prostate cancer. Despite this and mortality rate 
reductions reported from large randomized prostate cancer screening 
trials, routine use of the test remains controversial.

In  2012,  the  U.S.  Preventive  Services  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  pub-
lished  a  review  of  the  evidence  for  PSA-based  screening  for  prostate 
cancer and made a clear recommendation against screening. By giving 
a  grade  of  “D”  in  the  recommendation  statement  that  was  based  on 
this  review,  the  USPSTF  concluded  that  “there  is  moderate  or  high 
certainty  that  this  service  has  no  net  benefit  or  that  the  harms  out-
weigh  the  benefits.”  In  2013,  the  American  Urological  Association 
(AUA)  updated  their  consensus  statement  regarding  prostate  cancer 
screening. They concluded that the quality of evidence for the benefits 
of  screening  was  moderate  for  men  aged  55–69  years.  For  men  out-
side  this  age  range,  evidence  was  lacking  for  benefit,  but  the  harms  of 
screening,  including  overdiagnosis  and  overtreatment,  remained.  The 
AUA  recommends  shared  decision-making  for  men  aged  55–69  years 
considering PSA-based screening, a target age group for whom benefits 
may outweigh harms. Outside this age range, PSA-based screening as a 
routine was not recommended. The entire guideline is available at http://
www.auanet.org/guidelines/early-detection-of-prostate-cancer-(2013- 
reviewed-and-validity-confirmed-2015).  As  of  2017,  the  USPSTF  has 
issued  a  revised  recommendation  with  a  grade  of  “C”  for  PSA-based 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   682

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyprostate  cancer  screening  for  men  aged  55–69.  Now  they  recommend 
shared  decision-making  for  men  between  the  ages  of  55  and  69  and 
do  not  recommend  screening  for  men  aged  70  or  greater,  roughly  in 
agreement with the 2013 AUA guideline. The USPSTF also notes that the 
increased use of active surveillance (observation with selective delayed 
treatment) for low-risk prostate cancer has reduced the risks of screening.
We  believe  that  implementation  of  the  following  three  guidelines 
will further improve PSA screening outcomes in the United States and 
will have a greater practical impact on men’s health than the USPSTF 
and AUA recommendations that are based almost solely on age. First, 
avoid  PSA  tests  in  men  with  little  to  gain.  There  is  no  rationale  for 
recommending PSA screening in asymptomatic men with a short life 
expectancy. Hence, men over the age of 75 should only be tested in spe-
cial circumstances, such as a higher than median PSA measured before 
age 70 or excellent overall health. In addition, because a baseline PSA is 
a strong predictor of the future risk of lethal prostate cancer, men with 
low PSAs, for example <1 ng/mL, can undergo testing less frequently, 
perhaps every 5 years, with screening possibly ending at age 60 if the 
PSA remains at ≤1 ng/mL. Men with PSAs that are above an age median 
but  below  biopsy  thresholds  can  be  counseled  about  their  elevated 
risk and actively encouraged to return for regular screening and more 
comprehensive risk assessment. Second, do not treat those who do not 
need treatment. High proportions of men with screen-detected prostate 
cancer do not need immediate treatment and can be managed by active 
surveillance. Third, refer men who do need treatment to high-volume 
centers.  Although  it  is  clearly  not  feasible  to  restrict  treatment  exclu-
sively  to  high-volume  centers,  shifting  treatment  trends  so  that  more 
patients  are  treated  at  such  centers  by  high-volume  providers  will 
improve cancer control and decrease complications. The goal of pros-
tate cancer screening should be to maximize the benefits of PSA testing 
and minimize its harms. Following the three rules outlined here should 
continue to improve the ratio of harms to benefits from PSA screening.
The  PSA  criteria  used  to  recommend  a  diagnostic  prostate  biopsy 
have  evolved  over  time.  However,  based  on  the  commonly  used  cut 
point for prostate biopsy (a total PSA ≥4 ng/mL), most men with a PSA 
elevation do not have histologic evidence of prostate cancer at biopsy. 
In addition, many men with PSA levels below this cut point harbor can-
cer cells in their prostate. Information from the Prostate Cancer Pre-
vention Trial demonstrates that there is no PSA below which the risk 
of prostate cancer is zero. Thus, the PSA level establishes the likelihood 
that a man will harbor cancer if he undergoes a prostate biopsy. The 
goal is to increase the sensitivity of the test for younger men harboring 
clinically significant cancers that may cause symptoms and shorten sur-
vival and to reduce the frequency of detecting cancers of low malignant 
potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. Patients with 
symptomatic  bacterial  prostatitis  should  have  a  course  of  antibiotics 
before biopsy. However, the routine use of antibiotics in an asymptom-
atic man with an elevated PSA level is strongly discouraged.

SECOND-LINE  SCREENING  TESTS  Several  tests  have  been  developed 
to better stratify men with an elevated PSA test into those more or less 
likely to have clinically significant prostate cancer. The 4Kscore® Test 
(OPKO Lab, Nashville, TN) measures four prostate-specific kallikreins 
(total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and human kallikrein 2). The results 
are combined with clinical information in an algorithm that estimates an 
individual’s percent risk of having an aggressive prostate cancer should 
that individual opt for a prostate biopsy. The 4Kscore test has also been 
shown to identify the likelihood that an individual will develop aggres-
sive  prostate  cancer,  defined  as  high-grade  prostate  cancer  pathology 
and/or poor prostate cancer clinical outcomes, within 20 years.

The  Prostate  Health  Index  (PHITM,  Innovative  Diagnostic  Labora-
tory, Richmond, VA) is a blood test that estimates the risk of having 
prostate cancer. The PHI test is a combination of free PSA, total PSA, 
and the [–2]proPSA isoform of free PSA. These three tests are com-
bined  in  a  formula  that  calculates  the  PHI  score.  The  PHI  score  is  a 
better predictor of prostate cancer than the total PSA test alone or the 
free PSA test alone. Urine-based testing measuring exosomes (ExoDx 
Prostate Test) or mRNA levels of prostate cancer–related genes (Select-
MDx) is also available.

PROSTATE BIOPSY  A diagnosis of cancer is established by an image-
guided  needle  biopsy.  Direct  visualization  by  transrectal  ultrasound 
(TRUS),  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  or  fusion  of  the  ultra-
sound and MRI images ensures that all areas of the gland, including 
suspicious  areas,  are  sampled.  Contemporary  schemas  advise  an 
extended-pattern  12-core  biopsy  that  includes  sampling  from  the 
peripheral zone as well as a lesion-directed palpable nodule or suspi-
cious image-guided sampling. Because a prostate biopsy is subject to 
sampling  error,  men  with  an  abnormal  PSA  and  negative  biopsy  are 
frequently advised to undergo additional testing, which may include a 
4Kscore test, PHI, prostate MRI, and/or repeat biopsy.
PATHOLOGY  Each  core  of  the  biopsy  is  examined  for  the  presence 
of cancer, and the amount of cancer is quantified based on the length 
of the cancer within the core and the percentage of the core involved. 
Of  the  cancers  identified,  >95%  are  adenocarcinomas;  the  rest  are 
squamous  or  transitional  cell  tumors  or,  rarely,  carcinosarcomas  or 
small-cell histologies. Metastases to the prostate are rare, but in some 
cases, colon cancers or transitional cell tumors of the bladder invade 
the gland by direct extension.

When prostate cancer is diagnosed, a measure of histologic aggres-
siveness  is  assigned  using  the  Gleason  grading  system,  in  which  the 
dominant and secondary glandular histologic patterns are scored from 
1  (well  differentiated)  to  5  (undifferentiated)  and  summed  to  give  a 
total  score  of  2–10  for  each  tumor.  The  most  poorly  differentiated 
area  of  tumor  (i.e.,  the  area  with  the  highest  histologic  grade)  often 
determines  biologic  behavior.  The  presence  or  absence  of  perineural 
invasion and extracapsular spread is also recorded.

Over the years, the Gleason grading system has undergone several 
changes. Currently, Gleason total scores of 2–5 are no longer assigned, 
and in practice, the lowest total score is now assigned a 6, although the 
scale continues to range from 2 to 10. This leads to a logical yet incor-
rect assumption on the part of patients that their Gleason 6 cancer is in 
the middle of the scale, triggering the fear that their cancer is serious 
and the assumption that treatment is necessary despite Gleason score 
6 being favorable risk. To address these issues, a new five-grade group 
system has been developed:

Grade group 1 (Gleason score ≤6)
Grade group 2 (Gleason score 3+4 = 7)
Grade group 3 (Gleason score 4+3 = 7)
Grade group 4 (Gleason score 4+4 = 8)
Grade group 5 (Gleason scores 9 and 10)

The new system simplifies the grading of prostate cancer, appropri-
ately classifying the lowest risk as grade group 1 (rather than Gleason 
score 6), and accurately predicts prognosis.

PROSTATE  CANCER  STAGING  The  TNM  (tumor,  node,  metastasis) 
staging system includes categories for cancers that are identified solely 
on the basis of an abnormal PSA (T1c), those that are palpable but clin-
ically confined to the gland (T2), and those that have extended outside 
the gland (T3 and T4) (Table 87-1, Fig. 87-2). DRE alone is inaccurate 
in  determining  the  extent  of  disease  within  the  gland,  the  presence 
or absence of capsular invasion, involvement of seminal vesicles, and 
extension  of  disease  to  lymph  nodes.  Because  of  the  inadequacy  of 
DRE for staging, the TNM staging system was modified to include the 
results  of  imaging.  Unfortunately,  no  single  test  has  been  proven  to 
accurately indicate the stage or the presence of organ-confined disease, 
seminal vesicle involvement, or lymph node spread.

TRUS is the imaging technique most frequently used to assess the 
primary  tumor,  but  its  chief  use  is  directing  prostate  biopsies,  not 
staging. No TRUS finding consistently indicates cancer with certainty. 
Computed tomography (CT) lacks sensitivity and specificity to detect 
extraprostatic  extension  and  is  inferior  to  MRI  in  visualization  of 
lymph nodes. In general, MRI is superior to CT to detect cancers in 
the prostate, to assess local disease extent, and fused with ultrasound 
imaging, to guide sites to biopsy within the gland. MRI is also useful 
for the planning of surgery and radiation therapy.

Radionuclide  bone  scans  (bone  scintigraphy)  are  used  to  evaluate 
spread to osseous sites. This test is sensitive but relatively nonspecific

because it does not detect the cancer itself, only reaction of the bone 
to  the  presence  of  the  cancer  itself.  Consequently,  areas  of  increased 
uptake are not always related to metastatic disease. Healing fractures, 
arthritis, Paget’s disease, and other conditions will also cause abnormal 
uptake.  True-positive  bone  scans  are  uncommon  when  the  PSA  is  
<10 ng/mL unless the tumor is high-grade.

TREATMENT
Prostate Cancer 

CLINICALLY LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER
Patients  with  clinically  localized  disease  are  managed  by  radical 
prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance. Choice of 
therapy requires the consideration of several factors: the presence of 
symptoms, the probability that the untreated tumor will adversely 
affect the quality or duration of survival and thus require treatment, 

and the probability that the tumor can be cured by single-modality 
therapy  directed  to  the  prostate  versus  requiring  both  local  and 
systemic therapy to achieve cure.

There is no clear evidence for the superiority of any one form of 
local therapy relative to another. This is due to the lack of prospec-
tive randomized trials, referral bias and physician bias, variation in 
the experience of the treating teams, and differences in trial end-
points  and  the  definitions  of  cancer  control.  Often,  PSA  relapse–
free survival is used because an effect on metastatic progression or 
survival  may  not  be  apparent  for  years.  For  many  patients,  how-
ever, a PSA recurrence does not necessarily mean that the disease 
will  cause  symptoms  or  shorten  survival.  After  radical  surgery  to 
remove all prostate tissue, PSA should become undetectable in the 
blood within 6 weeks. If PSA remains or becomes detectable after 
radical prostatectomy, the patient is considered to have persistent 
or recurrent disease. After radiation therapy, in contrast, PSA does 
not become undetectable because the remaining nonmalignant ele-
ments of the gland continue to produce PSA even if all cancer cells 
have been eliminated. Similarly, cancer control is not well defined 
for  a  patient  managed  by  active  surveillance  because  PSA  levels 
may continue to rise in the absence of therapy. Other outcomes are 
time  to  objective  progression  (local  or  systemic),  cancer-specific 
survival,  and  overall  survival;  however,  these  outcomes  may  take 
years to assess.

The more extensive the local disease, the higher the probability 
of  regional  lymph  node  involvement  (even  when  imaging  studies 
are  normal),  the  lower  the  probability  of  local  control,  and  the 
higher the probability of relapse and the development of metastases. 
More  important  is  that  within  the  categories  of  clinical  stage  T1, 
T2, and T3 disease are cancers with a range of prognoses. Some T3 
tumors are curable with therapy directed solely at the prostate, and 
some  T1  lesions  have  a  high  probability  of  systemic  relapse  that 
requires  the  integration  of  local  and  systemic  therapy  to  achieve 
cure. For T1c cancers, stage alone is inadequate to predict outcome 
and select treatment; other factors must be considered.

To better assess risk and guide treatment selection, many groups 
have developed prognostic models or nomograms that use a com-
bination  of  the  initial  clinical  T  stage,  biopsy  Gleason  score,  the 
number of biopsy cores in which cancer is detected, and baseline 
PSA. Some use discrete cut points (PSA <10 or ≥10 ng/mL; Gleason 
score of ≤6, 7, or ≥8); others employ nomograms that use PSA and 
Gleason score as continuous variables. More than 100 nomograms 
have  been  reported  to  predict  (1)  the  probability  that  a  clinically 
significant  cancer  is  present,  (2)  disease  extent  (organ-confined 
vs  non–organ-confined,  node-negative  or  -positive),  or  (3)  the 
probability  of  treatment  success  for  specific  local  therapies  using 
pretreatment  variables.  Considerable  controversy  exists  over  what 
constitutes “high risk” based on a predicted probability of success or 
failure. In these situations, nomograms and predictive models can 
only go so far. Exactly what probability of success or failure would 
lead  a  physician  to  recommend  and  a  patient  to  seek  alternative

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyapproaches is controversial. As an example, it may be appropriate 
to  recommend  radical  surgery  for  a  younger  patient  with  a  low 
probability  of  cure.  Nomograms  are  being  refined  continually  to 
incorporate  additional  clinical  parameters,  biologic  determinants, 
and  year  of  treatment,  which  can  also  affect  outcomes,  making 
treatment decisions a dynamic process. 

Radical  Prostatectomy  The  goal  of  radical  prostatectomy  is  to 
excise the cancer completely with a clear margin, to maintain conti-
nence by preserving the external sphincter, and to preserve potency 
by sparing the autonomic nerves in the neurovascular bundle. The 
procedure is advised for patients with a life expectancy of 10 years 
or  more  and  is  performed  via  a  retropubic  or  perineal  approach 
or  via  a  minimally  invasive  robotic-assisted  or  hand-held  laparo-
scopic  approach.  Outcomes  can  be  predicted  using  postoperative 
nomograms that consider pretreatment factors and the pathologic 
findings  at  surgery.  PSA  failure  is  usually  defined  as  a  value  >0.1 
or 0.2 ng/mL. Specific criteria to guide the choice of one approach 
over another are lacking. Minimally invasive approaches offer the 
advantage of a shorter hospital stay and reduced blood loss. Rates 
of cancer control, recovery of continence, and recovery of erectile 
function  are  comparable.  The  individual  surgeon,  rather  than  the 
surgical approach used, is most important in determining outcomes 
after surgery.

Neoadjuvant  hormonal  treatment  with  gonadotropin-releasing   
hormone (GnRH) agonists/antagonists alone has also been explored 
to improve the outcomes of surgery for high-risk patients using a 
variety of definitions. The results of several large trials testing 3 or 
8 months of androgen depletion before surgery showed that serum 
PSA levels decreased by 96%, prostate volumes decreased by 34%, 
and margin positivity rates decreased from 41–17%. Unfortunately, 
these  findings  have  not  been  shown  to  improve  PSA  relapse–free 
survival.

Factors associated with incontinence following radical prostatec-
tomy include older age and urethral length, which impacts the abil-
ity to preserve the urethra beyond the apex and the distal sphincter. 
The skill and experience of the surgeon are also factors.

The likelihood of recovery of erectile function is associated with 
younger  age,  quality  of  erections  before  surgery,  and  the  absence 
of damage to the neurovascular bundles. In general, erectile func-
tion  begins  to  return  ~6  months  after  surgery  if  neurovascular 
tissue has been preserved. Potency is reduced by half if at least one 
neurovascular  bundle  is  sacrificed.  Overall,  with  the  availability 
of drugs such as sildenafil, intraurethral inserts of alprostadil, and 
intracavernosal  injections  of  vasodilators,  many  patients  recover 
satisfactory sexual function. 

Radiation Therapy  Radiation therapy is given by external beam, 
by radioactive sources implanted into the gland, or by a combina-
tion of the two techniques. 
External  beam  radiation  therapy  Contemporary  external 
beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) permits shap-
ing of the dose and allows the delivery of higher doses to the pros-
tate and a dramatic reduction in normal tissue exposure compared 
with three-dimensional conformal treatment alone. These advances 
have enabled the safe administration of doses >80 Gy and resulted 
in higher local control rates and fewer side effects.

Cancer  control  after  radiation  therapy  has  been  defined  by 
various  criteria,  including  a  decline  in  PSA  to  <0.5  or  1  ng/mL, 
“nonrising”  PSA  values,  and  a  negative  biopsy  of  the  prostate   
2 years after completion of treatment. The current standard defini-
tion of biochemical failure (the Phoenix definition) is a rise in PSA 
by ≥2 ng/mL higher than the lowest PSA achieved. Radiation dose 
is critical to the eradication of prostate cancer. In a representative 
study, a PSA nadir of <1.0 ng/mL was achieved in 90% of patients 
receiving 81.0 Gy versus 76% and 56% of those receiving 70.2 and 
64.8 Gy, respectively. Positive biopsy rates at 2.5 years were 4% for 
those treated with 81 Gy versus 27% and 36% for those receiving 
75.6 and 70.2 Gy, respectively.

Hypofractionation schedules, utilizing fewer treatments of higher 
radiation  doses,  have  been  evaluated  and  shown  to  provide  good 
cancer  control  rates  based  on  posttreatment  biopsies  showing  no 
evidence of cancer, with no apparent increase in treatment-related 
morbidity. Hypofractionated treatments can range from as few as 5 
treatments to upward of 26 treatments, both regimens representing 
substantial reductions in treatment length.

Multiple clinical trials have evaluated the use of androgen depri-
vation  therapy  (ADT)  in  combination  with  radiation.  In  patients 
with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, short-course ADT 
(6  months),  when  combined  with  external  beam  radiotherapy,  has 
demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival. In patients 
with high-risk disease, longer courses of ADT (18–36 months) have 
proven superior to shorter courses and represent the current stan-
dard of care when combined with radiotherapy.

The  Prostate  Testing  for  Cancer  and  Treatment  (ProtecT)  trial 
investigated the effects of active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, 
and radical radiotherapy with hormones on patient-reported out-
comes in men diagnosed with low- and intermediate-risk prostate 
cancer  (~75%  with  Gleason  score  6  or  grade  group  1  cancer). 
Patient-reported outcomes among 1643 men who completed ques-
tionnaires  before  diagnosis,  at  6  and  12  months,  and  annually 
thereafter were compared. Of the three treatments, prostatectomy 
had  the  greatest  negative  effect  on  sexual  function  and  urinary 
continence, and although there was some recovery, these outcomes 
remained  worse  in  the  prostatectomy  group  than  in  the  other 
groups  throughout  the  trial.  The  negative  effect  of  radiotherapy 
on  sexual  function  was  greatest  at  6  months,  but  sexual  function 
then  recovered  somewhat  and  was  stable  thereafter;  radiotherapy 
had little effect on urinary continence. Sexual and urinary function 
declined gradually in the active-monitoring group. Bowel function 
was worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months than in the other 
groups but then recovered somewhat, except for the increasing fre-
quency of bloody stools; bowel function was unchanged in the other 
groups. Urinary voiding and nocturia were worse in the radiother-
apy group at 6 months but then mostly recovered and were like the 
other  groups  after  12  months.  Effects  on  quality  of  life  mirrored 
the  reported  changes  in  function.  No  significant  differences  were 
observed among the groups in measures of anxiety, depression, or 
general health-related or cancer-related quality of life. 
Brachytherapy  Brachytherapy  is  the  direct  implantation  of 
radioactive sources (seeds) into the prostate. It is based on the prin-
ciple that the deposition of radiation energy in tissues decreases as 
a function of the square of the distance from the source (Chap. 73). 
The goal is to deliver intensive irradiation to the prostate, minimiz-
ing the exposure of the surrounding tissues. The current standard 
technique  achieves  a  more  homogeneous  dose  distribution  by 
placing seeds according to a customized template based on imaging 
assessment of the cancer and computer-optimized dosimetry. The 
implantation is performed transperineally as an outpatient proce-
dure with real-time imaging.

Improvements  in  brachytherapy  techniques  have  resulted  in 
fewer complications and a marked reduction in local failure rates. 
In a series of 197 patients followed for a median of 3 years, 5-year 
actuarial  PSA  relapse–free  survival  for  patients  with  pretherapy 
PSA  levels  of  0–4,  4–10,  and  >10  ng/mL  were  98,  90,  and  89%, 
respectively.  In  a  separate  report  of  201  patients  who  underwent 
posttreatment  biopsies,  80%  were  negative,  17%  were  indetermi-
nate, and 3% were positive. The results did not change with longer 
follow-up. Brachytherapy is well tolerated, although most patients 
experience  urinary  frequency  and  urgency  that  can  persist  for 
several months. Higher complication rates are observed in patients 
who have undergone a prior transurethral resection of the prostate 
(TURP), while those with obstructive symptoms at baseline are at a 
higher risk for retention and persistent voiding symptoms. Proctitis 
has been reported in <2% of patients. 
Active  surveillance  With  the  advent  of  PSA  testing,  many 
patients  are  diagnosed  with  low-risk  prostate  cancers  that  may

not  pose  a  threat  to  either  the  quantity  or  quality  of  man’s  life. 
Active  surveillance,  described  previously  as  watchful  waiting  or 
deferred therapy, evolved from (1) studies that evaluated predom-
inantly elderly men with well-differentiated tumors who remained 
untreated  and  demonstrated  no  clinically  significant  progression 
for  protracted  periods,  (2)  recognition  of  the  contrast  between 
incidence  and  disease-specific  mortality,  (3)  the  high  prevalence 
of autopsy cancers, and (4) an effort to reduce overtreatment and 
treatment-related side effects. In practice, active surveillance is the 
treatment recommended to patients with cancers of low aggressive-
ness that can be safely monitored at fixed intervals with DREs, PSA 
measurements, imaging (usually prostate MRI), and repeat prostate 
biopsies  as  indicated  until  histopathologic  or  serologic  changes 
correlative of progression warrant treatment with curative intent.

Case selection is critical, and determining the clinical parame-
ters predictive of cancer aggressiveness that can be used to reliably 
select men most likely to benefit from active surveillance is an area 
of intense study. One set of criteria includes men with clinical T1c 
tumors that are biopsy Gleason grade 6 (grade group 1) involving 
three or fewer cores, with each core having <50% involvement by 
tumor,  and  a  PSA  density  of  <0.15.  Nomograms  to  help  predict 
which  patients  can  safely  be  managed  by  active  surveillance  con-
tinue to be refined, and as their predictive accuracy improves, it can 
be anticipated that more patients will be candidates. 

RISING PSA AFTER DEFINITIVE LOCAL THERAPY
Patients in this state include those in whom the sole manifestation of 
disease is a rising PSA after surgery and/or radiation therapy. There 
is no evidence of disease on imaging studies. For these patients, the 
central issue is whether the rise in PSA results from persistent dis-
ease in the primary site, systemic disease, or both. In theory, disease 
in the primary site may still be curable by additional local treatment.
The  decision  to  recommend  radiation  therapy  after  prostatec-
tomy  is  guided  by  the  pathologic  findings  at  surgery,  the  timing 
of PSA failure, and the PSA level at the time of failure. Traditional 
imaging  (MRI,  CT,  and  radionucleotide  bone  scans),  especially 
at  low  levels  of  PSA,  are  typically  uninformative.  New  positron 
emission  tomography  (PET)  tracers  such  as  C-11  choline,  F-18 
fluciclovine, and F-18 or Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA) that directly image the cancer are more sensitive and can 
detect low-volume disease in the prostate bed or other sites to better 
inform  the  decision  to  recommend  additional  local  therapies.  All 
are FDA approved. Detection rates, both in and outside the prostate 
bed, correlate with the absolute level of PSA. Factors that predict for 
response to salvage radiation therapy are a positive surgical margin, 
lower  Gleason  score  in  the  radical  prostatectomy  specimen,  long 
interval from surgery to PSA failure, slow PSA doubling time, and 
low (<0.5 ng/mL) PSA value at the time of radiation treatment. For 
patients with a rising PSA after radiation therapy, salvage local ther-
apy can be considered if the disease was “curable” at the outset, if 
persistent disease has been documented by a biopsy of the prostate, 
and if no disease is detectable outside of the prostate bed or regional 
lymph  nodes  by  imaging.  Unfortunately,  case  selection  is  poorly 
defined  in  most  series,  and  morbidities  are  significant.  Options 
include salvage radical prostatectomy, salvage cryotherapy, salvage 
radiation therapy, and salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound.

The rise in PSA after surgery or radiation therapy may indicate 
subclinical or micrometastatic disease with or without local recur-
rence. In these cases, the need for treatment depends, in part, on the 
estimated probability that the patient will show evidence of meta-
static  disease  on  a  scan  and  in  what  time  frame.  That  immediate 
therapy is not always required was shown in a series where patients 
who developed a rising PSA after radical prostatectomy received no 
systemic therapy until metastatic disease was documented. Overall, 
the median time to metastatic progression was 8 years, and 63% of 
the patients with rising PSA values remained free of metastases at 
5 years. Factors associated with progression included the Gleason 
score  of  the  radical  prostatectomy  specimen,  time  to  recurrence 
after  surgery,  and  PSA  doubling  time.  For  those  with  Gleason 

score ≥8, the probability of metastatic progression was 37, 51, and 
71% at 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively. If the time to recurrence was  
<2 years and PSA doubling time was long (>10 months), the pro-
portions with metastatic disease at the same time intervals were 23, 
32, and 53%, versus 47, 69, and 79% if the doubling time was short  
(<10 months). PSA doubling times are also prognostic for survival. 
In one series, all patients who succumbed to disease had PSA dou-
bling times of ≤3 months. Most physicians advise treatment when 
PSA  doubling  times  are  ≤12  months.  A  difficulty  with  predicting 
the risk of metastatic spread, symptoms, or death from disease in 
the rising PSA state is that most patients receive some form of ther-
apy before the development of metastases. Nevertheless, predictive 
models continue to be refined. 

METASTATIC DISEASE: NONCASTRATE
The  state  of  noncastrate  metastatic  disease  includes  men  with 
metastases visible on an imaging study at the time of diagnosis or 
after  local  therapy(ies)  who  have  testosterone  levels  >150  ng/dL. 
Symptoms of metastatic disease include pain from osseous spread, 
although many patients are asymptomatic despite extensive spread. 
Less  common  are  symptoms  related  to  marrow  infiltration  by 
tumor (myelophthisis), coagulopathy, or spinal cord compression. 
Standard  treatment  is  to  deplete  or  lower  androgens  via  ADT  by 
medical  or  surgical  means,  the  latter  being  the  least  acceptable 
to  patients.  A  less  frequently  used  approach  is  to  block  androgen 
binding to the AR with antiandrogens. More than 90% of male hor-
mones originate in the testes; <10% are synthesized in the adrenal 
gland (Fig. 87-3). 
Testosterone-Lowering Agents  Medical therapies that lower tes-
tosterone levels include the GnRH agonists/antagonists, pure GnRH 
antagonists, 17,20-lyase inhibitors, CYP17 inhibitors, and estrogens 
such  as  diethylstilbestrol  (DES).  The  latter  are  rarely  utilized  due 
to  the  risk  of  vascular  complications  that  include  fluid  retention, 
phlebitis,  emboli,  and  stroke.  GnRH  agonists/antagonists,  such  as 
leuprolide acetate and goserelin acetate, initially produce a rise in 
luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone followed by 
a downregulation of receptors in the pituitary gland, which effects 
a chemical castration. Regulatory approval was based on random-
ized  trials  showing  reduced  cardiovascular  toxicities  relative  to 
DES, with equivalent potency. The initial rise in testosterone may 
result  in  a  clinical  flare  of  the  disease,  and  as  such,  these  agents 
are  relatively  contraindicated  in  men  with  significant  obstructive 
symptoms, cancer-related pain, or spinal cord compromise, events 
that do not occur with GnRH antagonists such as degarelix, given 
by injection, or relugolix, given orally, that rapidly achieve castrate 
levels of testosterone. AR antagonists that block testosterone bind-
ing to the receptor are also used to prevent flare.

Agents that lower testosterone are associated with an androgen-
deprivation syndrome that includes hot flushes, weakness, fatigue, 
loss of muscle mass, anemia, changes in cognition and personality, 
and depression. Changes in lipids, obesity, insulin resistance, and an 
increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease are also seen, 
along with a decrease in bone density that worsens over time and 
results in an increased risk of clinical fractures. This is a particular 
concern in men with preexisting osteopenia that results from hypo-
gonadism that may be worsened with steroid or alcohol use and sig-
nificantly underappreciated. Baseline fracture risk can be assessed 
using the FRAX scale, and to minimize fracture risk, patients are 
advised  to  take  calcium  and  vitamin  D  supplementation,  along 
with  a  bisphosphonate,  RANK-ligand  inhibitor  (denosumab),  or 
toremifene. 
Antiandrogens  Nonsteroidal first-generation antiandrogens such 
bicalutamide  and  nilutamide  have  largely  been  replaced  by  the 
more  potent  next-generation  agents  (enzalutamide,  apalutamide, 
and  darolutamide)  that  do  not  lower  serum  androgen  levels  and 
result  in  fewer  hot  flushes,  less  of  an  effect  on  libido,  less  muscle 
wasting,  fewer  personality  changes,  and  less  bone  loss  relative  to 
testosterone-lowering  therapies.  However,  over  time,  testosterone

levels  increase  and  are  converted  to  estrogen,  which  can  result  in 
mastalgia  and  gynecomastia  that  limits  long-term  use  but  can  be 
prevented in part by tamoxifen or prophylactic breast irradiation.

Most reported randomized trials suggest that the cancer-specific 
outcomes are inferior when antiandrogens are used alone. Bicalut-
amide, even at a dose of 150 mg (three times the approved dose for 
use in combination in GnRH agonists), resulted in a shorter time to 
progression and inferior survival compared with surgical castration 
for patients with established metastatic disease.

Improving  on  the  outcomes  with  ADT  alone  was  a  focus  of  the 
field  for  decades.  One  approach  was  to  combine  a  first-generation   
antiandrogen  (flutamide,  bicalutamide,  or  nilutamide)  with  a 
GnRH  analogue  or  surgical  orchiectomy;  however,  this  approach 
did not improve outcomes, and current use is largely limited to the 
first 2–4 weeks of treatment to protect against flare.

Practice  standards  changed  when  an  improvement  in  time  to 
progression and overall survival was shown when ADT was com-
bined with docetaxel, the first systemic therapy shown to prolong 
life  in  metastatic  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer  (mCRPC) 
approved in 2004, relative to ADT alone. The greatest benefit was 
seen  for  patients  with  “high-volume”  disease  defined  as  the  pres-
ence  of  ≥4  lesions  on  radionuclide  bone  scan  or  visceral  disease. 
For  abiraterone  acetate  and  prednisone,  benefit  was  seen  across 
disease  states  ranging  from  high-risk  localized  to  metastatic  dis-
ease. Longer progression-free and overall survival times have been 
noted in separate phase 3 trials comparing ADT with abiraterone, 
a CYP17 inhibitor that blocks androgen synthesis, and ADT with 
the AR antagonists enzalutamide and apalutamide versus the ADT 
standard, further changing the standards of care. 
Intermittent  Androgen  Deprivation  Therapy  (IADT)  One  way 
to  reduce  the  side  effects  of  androgen  depletion  is  to  administer 
antiandrogens  on  an  intermittent  basis.  This  was  proposed  as  a 
way to prevent the selection of cells that are resistant to androgen 
depletion.  The  hypothesis  is  that  by  allowing  endogenous  testos-
terone levels to rise, the cells that survive androgen depletion will 
induce a normal differentiation pathway. In this way, the surviving 
cells that are allowed to proliferate in the presence of androgen will 
retain sensitivity to subsequent androgen depletion. Applied in the 
clinic, androgen depletion is continued for 2–6 months beyond the 
point of maximal response. Once treatment is stopped, endogenous 
testosterone  levels  increase,  and  the  symptoms  associated  with 
hormone treatment abate. PSA levels also begin to rise, and at some 
level, treatment is restarted. With this approach, multiple cycles of 
regression  and  proliferation  have  been  documented  in  individual 
patients. Unknown is whether the intermittent approach increases, 
decreases, or does not change the overall duration of sensitivity to 
androgen  depletion.  The  approach  is  safe,  but  long-term  data  are 
needed to assess the course in men with low PSA levels. A trial to 
address this question is ongoing. 
Outcomes  of  Androgen  Deprivation  The  anti–prostate  cancer 
effects of the various androgen depletion strategies are similar, and 
the  clinical  course  is  predictable:  an  initial  response,  a  period  of 
stability in which tumor cells are dormant and nonproliferative, fol-
lowed after a variable period of time by a rise in PSA and regrowth 
that is visible on a scan as a castration-resistant lesion. Androgen 
depletion  is  not  curative  because  cells  that  survive  castration  are 
present when the disease is first diagnosed. Considered by disease 
manifestation, PSA levels return to normal in 60–70% of patients, 
and  measurable  disease  regression  occurs  in  50%;  improvements 
in bone scan occur in 25% of cases, but the majority remain stable. 
Duration  of  survival  is  inversely  proportional  to  disease  extent  at 
the time androgen depletion is first started and the nadir level of 
PSA at 6 months. Patients with nadir values above a certain thresh-
old have markedly inferior survival times and should be considered 
for alternative approaches.

An unresolved question remains on how early systemic therapies 
should be offered to patients: in the adjuvant setting after surgery 
or  radiation  treatment  of  the  primary  tumor;  at  the  time  that  a 
PSA recurrence is documented; or wait until metastatic disease or 
symptoms of disease are manifest? Trials in support of early therapy 
have been largely underpowered relative to the reported benefit or 
have  been  criticized  on  methodologic  grounds.  One  that  showed 
a  survival  benefit  for  patients  treated  with  radiation  therapy  and   
3  years  of  ADT,  relative  to  radiation  alone,  was  criticized  for  the 
poor  outcomes  of  the  control  group.  Another  showing  a  survival 
benefit for patients with positive lymph nodes who were random-
ized  to  immediate  medical  or  surgical  castration  compared  with

observation (p = .02) was criticized because the confidence intervals 
around the 5- and 8-year survival distributions for the two groups 
overlapped. 
METASTATIC DISEASE: CASTRATE
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), disease that progresses 
while the measured levels of testosterone in the blood are 50 ng/mL 
or lower, can produce some of the most feared complications of the 
disease and is lethal for most men. The most common manifesta-
tion  is  a  rising  PSA,  frequently  co-occurring  with  progression  in 
bone. Nodal and/or visceral spread is less frequent. Symptoms may 
or may not be present. The bone- and PSA-dominant pattern limits 
the  ability  to  assess  treatment  effects  reliably  because  traditional 
bone  imaging  is  inaccurate  and  no  PSA-based  outcome  has  been 
shown to be a true surrogate for survival, and accordingly, favorable 
changes  with  either  can  be  used  to  support  regulatory  approvals. 
Critical  for  management  is  that  therapeutic  objectives  be  based 
on the manifestations of the disease in the individual at the time a 
change in therapy is being considered. As such, for the patient with 
symptomatic bone disease, relief of pain can be more clinically rel-
evant than lowering the PSA. Naturally, for all patients, the central 
focus is delaying or preventing disease progression, symptoms, and 
death from disease.

Through  2010,  docetaxel  was  the  only  FDA-approved  life- 
prolonging therapy for CRPC. Since then, our understanding of the 
biology of the disease has increased significantly, which in turn has 
led to improved therapies. In particular, it is now recognized that 
the majority of mCRPCs continue to express the AR and remain AR 
signaling dependent, and upward of 50% of cases harbor a series of 
oncogenic changes including overexpression, splice variants lacking 
the ligand binding domain and that stimulate growth independent 
of  the  ligand,  and  upregulation  of  the  enzymes  in  the  androgen 
biosynthesis pathway, leading to an increase in intratumoral andro-
gens. These oncogenic changes have been successfully targeted with 
the next-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide, apalutamide, and 
darolutamide  and  the  CYP17  inhibitor  abiraterone  acetate  (given 
in  combination  with  prednisone),  all  of  which  have  been  proven 
to prolong life and are FDA approved for use in CRPC in both the 
pre- and postchemotherapy setting.

Large-scale molecular profiling efforts have led to a biologically 
based  disease  taxonomy  that  continues  to  evolve  and  showed  a 
markedly higher than expected frequency of germline and somatic 
BRCA2  alterations,  along  with  other  genes  in  the  DNA  damage 
repair pathway that have been targeted successfully with poly-ADP 
ribose  polymerase  (PARP)  inhibitors  of  which  two,  olaparib  and 
rucaparib,  are  FDA  approved,  and  one,  niraparib,  has  achieved  a 
breakthrough designation. Also approved is the checkpoint inhib-
itor pembrolizumab for tumors with high microsatellite instability 
(MSI)  scores,  an  alteration  found  in  2–3%  of  prostate  cancers  for 
which  a  dedicated  prostate  cancer  trial  would  never  have  been 
conducted.

Other  classes  of  therapy  are  approved  based  on  a  demonstrated 
survival benefits include the biologic agent sipuleucel-T, the second- 
generation  taxane  cabazitaxel,  and  the  α-emitting  bone-targeting 
radiopharmaceutical  radium-223.  Approval  is  also  anticipated  for 
PSMA-directed  radionuclide  therapy  based  on  the  survival  ben-
efit  of  Lu-177  PSMA  in  the  phase  3  VISION  trial  relative  to  best 
supportive  care  alone.  Overall,  an  intense  focus  of  current  CRPC 
research is to understand the optimal sequence in which to utilize 
these agents to maximize benefit for the individual patient. Most of 
these agents are also being tested earlier in the course of the disease 
when tumor burdens are lower and the disease less heterogeneous. 
The result has been an increase in the frequency of late-state tumors 
that  have  undergone  a  lineage  transformation  from  epithelial  to 
neuroendocrine  phenotypes  and  are  highly  resistant  to  available 
therapies. 
Pain Management  Pain secondary to osseous metastases is one of 
the most feared complications of the disease and a major cause of 
morbidity, worsened by the narcotics needed to control symptoms. 

Management requires accurate diagnoses because noncancer etiol-
ogies including degenerative disease, spinal stenosis, and vertebral 
collapse  secondary  to  bone  loss  are  common.  Neurologic  symp-
toms, including those suggestive of base of skull disease or spinal 
cord  compromise,  require  emergency  evaluation  because  loss  of 
function  may  be  permanent  if  not  addressed  quickly.  Neurologic 
symptoms and loss of function are best treated with external beam 
radiation,  as  are  single  sites  of  pain.  Diffuse  symptoms  in  the 
absence  of  neurologic  deficits  can  be  treated  with  bone-seeking 
radioisotopes, such as radium-223 or the β emitter 153Sm-EDTMP; 
mitoxantrone;  or  other  systemic  therapies,  such  as  abiraterone 
acetate, enzalutamide, and docetaxel. Radium-223 is indicated for 
patients with symptoms, whereas 153Sm-EDTMP and mitoxantrone 
are approved for the palliation of pain but have not been shown to 
prolong life. Abiraterone, enzalutamide, and docetaxel do not have 
a formal indication for pain but were shown to palliate pain in the 
registration trials that led to their approval by showing a survival 
benefit.

Other bone-targeting agents, including bisphosphonates such as 
zoledronic  acid  and  the  RANK-ligand  inhibitor  denosumab,  have 
been  shown  to  reduce  the  frequency  and  development  of  skeletal 
complications including pain requiring analgesia, neurologic com-
promise  from  epidural  extension  of  tumor,  and/or  the  need  for 
surgery or radiation therapy to treat symptomatic osseous disease. 
It is important to note that, for all of these agents, the direct effect 
on the tumor is modest, and benefits are seen without declines in 
PSA or improvements on imaging.

BENIGN DISEASE
 ■ BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA
BPH  is  a  pathologic  process  that  contributes  to  the  development 
of  lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  (LUTS)  in  men.  LUTS,  arising 
from  lower  urinary  tract  dysfunction,  are  further  subdivided  into 
obstructive  symptoms  (urinary  hesitancy,  straining,  weak  stream, 
terminal dribbling, prolonged voiding, incomplete emptying) and irri-
tative symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, small 
voided volumes). LUTS and other sequelae of BPH are not just due to 
a mass effect but are also likely due to a combination of the prostatic 
enlargement and age-related detrusor dysfunction.

Diagnostic  Procedures  and  Treatment  LUTS  are  generally 
measured  using  a  validated,  reproducible  index  that  is  designed  to 
determine disease severity and response to therapy—the AUA’s Symp-
tom Index (AUASI), also adopted as the International Prostate Symp-
tom Score (IPSS) (Table 87-2). Serial AUASI is particularly useful in 
following  patients  as  they  are  treated  with  various  forms  of  therapy. 
Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment regardless of the size 
of the gland, while those with an inability to urinate, gross hematuria, 
recurrent  infection,  or  bladder  stones  require  evaluation  and  treat-
ment.  In  patients  with  symptoms,  uroflowmetry  can  identify  those 
with normal flow rates who are unlikely to benefit from treatment, and 
bladder ultrasound can identify those with high postvoid residuals who 
may need intervention. Pressure-flow (urodynamic) studies detect pri-
mary bladder dysfunction. Cystoscopy is recommended if hematuria 
is documented and to assess the urinary outflow tract before surgery. 
Imaging of the upper tracts is advised for patients with hematuria, a 
history of calculi, or prior urinary tract problems.

Symptomatic relief is the most common reason men seek treatment 
for BPH, and therefore, symptomatic relief is usually the goal of ther-
apy  for  BPH.  α-Adrenergic  receptor  antagonists  are  thought  to  treat 
the dynamic aspect of BPH by reducing sympathetic tone of the blad-
der outlet, thereby decreasing resistance and improving urinary flow. 
5ARIs are thought to treat the static aspect of BPH by reducing prostate 
volume  and  having  a  similar,  albeit  delayed  effect.  5ARIs  have  also 
proven beneficial in the prevention of BPH progression, as measured 
by prostate volume, the risk of developing acute urinary retention, and 
the risk of having BPH-related surgery. The use of an alpha-adrenergic

receptor antagonist and a 5ARI as combination therapy seeks to pro-
vide symptomatic relief while preventing progression of BPH.

Another class of medications that has shown improvement in LUTS 
secondary  to  BPH  is  phosphodiesterase-5  (PDE5)  inhibitors,  used 
currently in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. All four of the PDE5 
inhibitors available in the United States—sildenafil, vardenafil, tadala-
fil, and avanafil—appear to be effective in the treatment of LUTS sec-
ondary to BPH. The use of PDE5 inhibitors is not without controversy, 
however, given the fact that short-acting phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
such as sildenafil need to be dosed separately from alpha blockers such 
as tamsulosin because of potential hypotensive effects.

Symptoms  due  to  BPH  often  coexist  with  symptoms  due  to  over-
active  bladder,  and  the  most  common  pharmacologic  agents  for  the 
treatment  of  overactive  bladder  symptoms  are  anticholinergics.  This 
has  led  to  multiple  studies  evaluating  the  efficacy  of  anticholinergics 
for the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH.

Surgical  therapy  is  now  considered  second-line  therapy  and  is 
usually  reserved  for  patients  after  a  trial  of  medical  therapy.  The 
goal  of  surgical  therapy  is  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  prostate,  effec-
tively  reducing  resistance  to  urine  flow.  Surgical  approaches  include 
TURP,  transurethral  incision,  or  removal  of  the  gland  via  a  retropu-
bic,  suprapubic,  or  perineal  approach.  Also  used  are  transurethral 
ultrasound-guided  laser-induced  prostatectomy  (TULIP),  stents,  and 
hyperthermia.

88 Testicular Cancer

David J. Vaughn

Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent 95% of all testicular neo-
plasms. Non-GCTs of the testis are much less common. Approximately 
5% of GCTs arise in extragonadal locations including the mediastinum, 
retroperitoneum,  and  pineal  gland.  Treatment  for  testicular  GCTs 
is  determined  by  pathology  and  stage.  The  development  of  effective 
chemotherapy  for  this  disease  represents  a  landmark  achievement  in 
oncology. About 95% of newly diagnosed patients with testicular GCTs 
will be cured. For this reason, testicular cancer has been called “a model 
for a curable neoplasm.”

 ■ INCIDENCE
In 2021, ∼9500 cases of testicular GCTs will be diagnosed in the United 
States, with <450 deaths. These tumors are diagnosed most commonly 
in men between 20 and 40 years. The incidence of GCTs is increasing 
in men age 50 years and older.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The incidence of testicular GCTs appears to be increasing worldwide. 
The disease has the highest incidence in Scandinavia, Western Europe, 
and Australia/New Zealand. Africa and Asia have the lowest incidence. 
The incidence in the United States and the United Kingdom is inter-
mediate. While there does not appear to be a distinct biology related to 
geography, several countries have reported a migration to earlier stage 
disease in part related to public awareness and earlier diagnosis.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
GCTs are predominantly seen in young Caucasian men. The disease is 
much less commonly seen in African Americans. Testicular GCTs have 
an estimated heritability of almost 50%. Interestingly, the risk of GCT 
is  higher  in  male  siblings  than  in  offspring  of  the  patient.  Although 
epidemiologic  studies  have  been  performed  attempting  to  identify  a 
relationship with environmental exposures, no conclusive causal links 
have been established.

Risk Factors  The strongest risk factors for testicular GCT include 
a prior history of the disease, cryptorchidism, and a history of testic-
ular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS). Patients with a prior history 
of  testicular  GCT  have  a  2%  risk  of  developing  a  contralateral  GCT. 
These are more commonly metachronous than synchronous. Men with 
cryptorchidism have approximately a four- to sixfold increased risk of 
developing testicular GCT. Orchidopexy before puberty decreases but 
does not eliminate this risk. Interestingly, the contralateral descended 
testis is also at risk for this disease. Men undergoing infertility evalu-
ation in which a testicular biopsy demonstrates GCNIS have a signifi-
cant risk of developing GCT. Although scrotal ultrasound of patients 
with  testicular  GCT  may  demonstrate  testicular  microcalcifications 
that may be related to GCNIS, the significance of testicular microcalci-
fications in the general population is unclear.

 ■ BIOLOGY
The primordial germ cell is the cell of origin for GCTs. Most malig-
nant GCTs arise from GCNIS. The molecular events that result in the 
development of GCNIS and subsequent malignant GCT have not been 
fully determined. However, genetic analysis of GCTs has demonstrated 
an excess copy number of isochromosome 12p (i[12p]) in most cases. 
Several  genome-wide  association  studies  have  identified  multiple 
independent loci associated with testicular GCT risk. The strongest of 
these is the KITLG (KIT ligand) locus on chromosome 12. These loci 
contribute significantly to the heritable risk of this disease.
 ■ PATHOLOGY
GCTs are either seminomas or nonseminomas. For a tumor to be con-
sidered a seminoma, it must be 100% seminoma. Any mixed GCT is 
best  approached  as  a  nonseminomatous  GCT  (NSGCT).  Seminomas 
represent ∼50% of cases. Seminomas arise most commonly in patients 
in  the  fourth  decade  of  life.  Seminomas  may  contain  syncytiotro-
phoblastic cells, which may secrete β human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG).  Seminomas  do  not  secrete  α  fetoprotein  (AFP).  Seminomas 
are exquisitely sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
NSGCTs  are  most  commonly  diagnosed  in  the  third  decade  of  life. 
The histologic subtypes include embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, 
choriocarcinoma,  and  teratoma.  Embryonal  carcinoma  is  the  most 
undifferentiated  NSGCT  subtype  with  the  potential  to  differentiate 
into the other subtypes. Embryonal carcinoma may secrete AFP, hCG, 
both, or neither. Yolk sac tumor often secretes AFP. Choriocarcinoma 
is an aggressive subtype, often secreting hCG at very high levels. These 
NSGCT subtypes are all considered chemotherapy sensitive. Teratoma 
is composed of somatic cell types that are derived from two or more 
germinal layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). Teratomas are 
classified as mature, in which cell types resemble normal adult somatic 

tissue; immature, in which cell types resemble fetal somatic tissue; and 
malignant, in which the cell types have undergone malignant transfor-
mation into the malignant counterpart of the somatic tissue. Teratomas 
are chemotherapy resistant and must be approached surgically.

 ■ INITIAL PRESENTATION
Signs and Symptoms  Although a painless testicular mass is pathog-
nomonic of a GCT, most patients present with testicular swelling, firm-
ness, discomfort, or a combination of these. The differential diagnosis may 
include epididymitis or orchitis and a trial of antibacterials may be con-
sidered. Patients with retroperitoneal metastases may complain of back or 
flank pain. Patients may have cough, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis 
as a result of lung metastases. In patients with elevation of serum hCG, 
gynecomastia  may  be  present.  Diagnostic  delay  is  not  uncommon  and 
may be associated with a more advanced stage at diagnosis.

Physical Examination  Careful examination of the affected testis 
and the contralateral normal testis should be performed. Many tumors 
will  have  a  hard  consistency  to  palpation.  Some  patients  may  show 
testicular  atrophy.  Evaluation  for  supraclavicular  lymphadenopathy, 
gynecomastia,  and  abdominal  mass  should  be  performed.  Inguinal 
lymphadenopathy is rare. Most patients with lung metastases will have 
normal auscultation of the lungs.

Diagnostic Testing 
If a firm testicular mass is identified, a scrotal 
ultrasound should be performed. Patients with suspected epididymitis 
or  orchitis  who  do  not  respond  to  antibiotics  should  also  undergo 
scrotal  ultrasound.  Scrotal  ultrasound  should  include  both  testicles. 
On ultrasound, a testicular GCT is hypoechoic and may be multifocal. 
A solid mass identified on ultrasound should be considered malignant 
until otherwise proven. Transscrotal aspiration or biopsy of a testicular 
mass should never be performed. Such scrotal violation may result in 
tumor seeding of the scrotum or inguinal lymph nodes.

Serum  Tumor  Markers  Serum  AFP,  hCG,  and  lactate  dehydro-
genase  (LDH)  should  be  measured  in  patients  suspected  of  testicu-
lar  GCT.  AFP  is  elevated  in  ∼60–70%  of  patients  who  present  with 
NSGCTs.  Seminomas  never  secrete  AFP.  A  patient  with  a  seminoma 
with  elevation  of  AFP  should  be  approached  as  having  an  NSGCT. 
The half-life of AFP is 5–7 days. A falsely elevated AFP may be seen 
in patients with hepatic disease or a condition called hereditary persis-
tence of AFP, in which patients may have baseline AFP levels that are 
mildly elevated. hCG may be elevated in both NSGCTs as well as sem-
inomas.  Patients  with  choriocarcinoma  may  have  markedly  elevated 
levels of hCG. The half-life for hCG is 24–36 h. False-positive elevation 
of hCG may be seen secondary to hypogonadism, marijuana use, or as 
a result of interfering substances measured by the assay. LDH is a non-
specific marker for GCT. Its principal use is to help in the assessment 
of the risk classification of a patient with metastatic disease. Although 
elevation of serum tumor markers supports the diagnosis of a testicu-
lar GCT, it should be remembered that most patients with seminoma 
and up to a third of patients with NSGCTs do not have elevated levels. 
Serum  microRNA  (miR)-371a-3  has  been  identified  as  a  promising 
biomarker for GCT, and validation studies are ongoing.

 ■ INITIAL MANAGEMENT
Inguinal  Orchiectomy  Prompt  referral  to  urology  should  be 
performed  if  a  testicular  GCT  is  suspected.  The  initial  treatment  for 
most patients suspected of having a testicular GCT is radical inguinal 
orchiectomy  with  removal  of  the  testicle  and  spermatic  cord  to  the 
level of the internal inguinal ring. In patients who present with met-
astatic disease and the diagnosis of GCT is certain, orchiectomy may 
be deferred until completion of chemotherapy. Although some institu-
tions  perform  testis-sparing  surgery  in  select  patients,  the  gold  stan-
dard remains radical inguinal orchiectomy. Pathologic examination of 
the entire testicle is important, since testicular GCTs may be multifocal. 
Given the rarity of this cancer, review by an experienced pathologist 
is  essential  for  accurate  tumor  classification.  Serum  tumor  markers 
should be obtained before and after orchiectomy.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyStaging  The staging of testicular GCT is based on an understanding 
of the pattern of spread. The initial spread is by the lymphatic route to 
the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A left-sided testicular GCT spreads 
first to the primary landing zone of left paraaortic lymph nodes infe-
rior to the left renal vessels. A right-sided testicular GCT spreads first 
to  the  primary  landing  zone  of  the  aortocaval  nodes  inferior  to  the 
right renal vessels. Nodal metastases may extend into the iliac regions. 
If scrotal violation occurred, inguinal lymph node metastases may be 
seen.  Subsequent  lymphatic  spread  is  to  the  retrocrural,  mediastinal, 
and supraclavicular lymph nodes. Hematogenous spread to the lung is 
the next most common site of metastasis. Metastases to the liver, bone, 
and brain are less commonly seen. Patients with newly diagnosed tes-
ticular GCTs should undergo computed tomography (CT) scan of the 
abdomen and pelvis. Chest x-ray should be performed. CT scan of the 
chest is performed if retroperitoneal metastases are present or if lung 
nodules  are  identified  on  chest  x-ray.  Bone  scan  and  magnetic  reso-
nance imaging (MRI) of the brain are not routinely performed unless 
clinically indicated. Positron emission tomography (PET) has little role 
in the initial staging of testicular GCTs.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis 
(TNM)  staging  classification  is  used.  There  are  three  main  stages  of 
testicular GCT. Stage I is limited to the testis; stage II involves the retro-
peritoneal  lymph  nodes;  and  stage  III  includes  lymph  node  involve-
ment beyond the retroperitoneum and/or distant metastatic disease.

 ■ STAGE-BASED MANAGEMENT
Treatment of testicular GCT is based on two factors: (1) whether the 
tumor is seminoma or NSGCT and (2) the stage of the patient. This is 
summarized in Fig. 88-1.

Stage  I 
•  SEMINOMA  About  70%  of  newly  diagnosed  patients 
with  seminoma  present  with  stage  I  disease.  This  is  defined  as  no 
evidence of metastatic disease on imaging of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis. Approximately 15% of patients with stage I seminoma have met-
astatic disease at the microscopic level, usually in the retroperitoneum. 
Historically, patients with stage I seminoma were treated with a course 
of adjuvant radiation therapy to the paraaortic lymph nodes. While still 
an  option,  this  is  not  usually  performed  because  of  concerns  for  late 
radiation-induced  secondary  malignancies.  Active  surveillance  is  the 
most common approach elected by these patients following orchiectomy. 
With active surveillance, interval physical examination and CT scan of 
the abdomen are performed. For the 15% of patients who develop met-
astatic disease during active surveillance, treatment with definitive radi-
ation therapy or chemotherapy is curative in nearly all. A third option 
for clinical stage I seminoma is adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin 
monotherapy for one or two cycles. While effective in decreasing the risk 
of recurrence, it should be remembered that most patients are cured by 
orchiectomy alone, and therefore, the additional treatment is unneces-
sary. In addition, long-term data on toxicity are not available.
NSGCTs  About 40% of newly diagnosed patients with NSGCTs pres-
ent with stage I disease. Because NSGCTs have an increased potential 
for invasion and metastasis, spread to the retroperitoneum and beyond 
is  more  common  than  with  seminoma.  If  pre-orchiectomy  serum 
tumor  markers  are  elevated,  these  must  normalize  after  orchiectomy 
to  be  considered  stage  I.  Patients  with  persistently  elevated  or  rising 
serum  tumor  markers  after  orchiectomy  have  stage  IS  disease  and 
should  be  treated  with  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy.  If  the  tumor  is 
limited  to  testis  without  lymphovascular  invasion,  the  risk  of  recur-
rence  is  approximately  20%.  However,  if  the  tumor  has  high-risk 
features including lymphovascular invasion, invasion of the spermatic 
cord,  or  invasion  of  the  scrotum,  the  risk  of  recurrence  is  ∼50%  or 
higher.  Historically,  a  prophylactic  retroperitoneal  lymph  node  dis-
section (RPLND) was performed. This surgery is not only diagnostic 
but also therapeutic. In fact, most patients who undergo prophylactic 
RPLND  will  never  require  chemotherapy.  While  still  an  option,  this 
approach  subjects  many  patients  to  unnecessary  major  abdominal 
surgery. RPLND is also associated with a small risk of retrograde ejac-
ulation  due  to  nerve  injury,  and  nerve-sparing  techniques  have  been 
developed.  Active  surveillance  is  frequently  performed  especially  for 

patients without lymphovascular invasion. Most patients who relapse 
will  be  treated  with  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy  and  achieve  cure 
rates approaching 100%. Active surveillance can also be employed for 
patients with higher risk features, although the risk of progression is 
significantly higher. For this reason, some advocate adjuvant cisplatin- 
based  chemotherapy  with  BEP  (bleomycin,  etoposide,  cisplatin)  for 
one cycle for these patients. Other centers favor a prophylactic RPLND. 
Almost all patients who present with stage I NSGCTs will achieve cure.

Stage  II 
•  SEMINOMA  Approximately  15–20%  of  newly  diag-
nosed patients with seminoma present with stage II disease. Patients 
are subgrouped into IIA, IIB, or IIC based on the size of the retroperi-
toneal nodes (≤2 cm, >2 to 5 cm, or >5 cm, respectively). Patients with 
stage  IIA  disease  are  usually  treated  with  “dogleg”  radiation  therapy 
(referring  to  the  shape  of  the  radiation  field),  which  includes  the 
paraaortic  and  ipsilateral  iliac  nodes.  Cisplatin-based  chemotherapy 
may also be considered. Stage IIB disease is treated with cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy  or,  in  select  patients,  radiation  therapy.  Most  patients 
treated with radiation therapy who relapse will subsequently be cured 
with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. For patients with stage IIC disease, 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy should be used.

NSGCTs  Approximately 15% of newly diagnosed patients with NSGCTs 
present  with  clinical  stage  II  disease.  Patients  with  stage  IIA  disease 
may  be  treated  with  primary  RPLND.  Alternatively,  these  patients 
may be treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients with stage 
IIB  and  IIC  disease  are  best  initially  managed  with  cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy.

Stage  III  Patients  who  present  with  stage  III  GCT  (seminoma 
or  NSGCT)  are  treated  with  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy.  These 
patients are classified into good-, intermediate-, or poor-risk categories 
using  the  International  Germ  Cell  Consensus  Classification  system, 
which is based on clinical factors including histology, site of primary, 
the  presence  of  nonpulmonary  visceral  metastatic  disease,  and  the 
level  of  postorchiectomy  serum  tumor  markers  (Table  88-1).  Most 
patients with stage III GCT present with good-risk disease; >90% will 
be cured.  The  remainder present with intermediate-risk or poor-risk 
disease, associated with 5-year survival rates of ∼80% and 50%, respec-
tively.  Select  patients  with  rapidly  progressive  metastatic  disease  and 
life-threatening symptoms such as hemoptysis in whom there is a high 
clinical  suspicion  of  GCT  should  emergently  initiate  cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy, even without a tissue diagnosis.

Chemotherapy  The  development  of  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy 
represents an important advance in cancer medicine. Through a series of 
carefully performed clinical trials with the aim of maximizing cure while 
minimizing the extent of treatment, the chemotherapy approach to the 
treatment of these patients has been standardized. Patients with good-risk 
metastatic GCT are treated with either three cycles of BEP or four cycles 
of  etoposide  and  cisplatin  (EP).  Patients  with  intermediate-  and  poor-
risk metastatic disease are treated with either four cycles of BEP or four 
cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP). Maintaining dose and 
schedule is important, as dose modifications and delays have been associ-
ated with inferior outcomes. Serum tumor markers should be monitored 
throughout  treatment  and  should  normalize  during  or  after  treatment. 
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with myelosuppression, nau-
sea and vomiting, and alopecia. Cisplatin may result in nephrotoxicity, oto-
toxicity, and peripheral neuropathy. Bleomycin may result in pulmonary 
toxicity, and risk factors for this include age >40, renal failure, tobacco use, 
and the cumulative dose of bleomycin received. For patients at increased 
risk of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis, non-bleomycin-containing reg-
imens  as  noted  above  may  be  given.  Cisplatin-based  chemotherapy 
is  also  associated  with  sterility.  Approximately  30%  of  newly  diag-
nosed testicular GCT patients have severe oligospermia or azoospermia. 
For  the  remainder  with  normal  baseline  spermatogenesis  who  receive  
cisplatin-based chemotherapy, all will be azoospermic at the completion of 
therapy. Approximately 80% of these patients will recover spermatogene-
sis over a period of several years. For this reason, prechemotherapy sperm 
banking should be offered to all patients treated with chemotherapy.

Postchemotherapy Surgery  Upon completion of cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy, many patients with normalized serum tumor markers 
will have radiographic evidence of residual masses. In approximately 
half of patients with NSGCT, the residual mass is composed of necrosis 
and/or fibrosis. About 40% will have residual teratoma and only 10% 
will have residual viable nonteratomatous GCT. Unfortunately, radio-
graphic imaging cannot accurately differentiate between these entities. 
For  this  reason,  NSGCT  patients  with  residual  masses  after  chemo-
therapy undergo resection of all sites of disease. This most commonly 
includes  a  postchemotherapy  RPLND.  However,  thoracotomy  and 
neck dissection are required in some patients. If the patients are found 
to have residual necrosis or teratoma, no additional therapy is required. 
However, for patients with residual viable nonteratomatous GCT, two 
additional  cycles  of  chemotherapy  are  frequently  administered.  It 
should be noted that in most centers, patients with minimal residual 
tumors  defined  as  retroperitoneal  lymph  nodes  of  ≤1  cm  will  forego 
postchemotherapy RPLND. Patients who experience normalization of 
serum tumor markers with first-line chemotherapy but have enlarging 
tumors,  most  often  cystic  masses  in  the  retroperitoneum,  may  have 
“growing teratoma syndrome.” These patients are best approached with 
surgery.

For  patients  with  metastatic  seminoma,  most  residual  masses  are 
necrotic and do not harbor viable tumor. Patients with residual masses 
of  3  cm  or  less  may  be  observed  without  surgery.  For  patients  with 
residual masses >3 cm, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET may be used to 
distinguish necrosis from viable seminoma and identify patients who 
should be considered for postchemotherapy surgery or short interval 
imaging.

 ■ RELAPSED DISEASE
Approximately 20–30% of patients with metastatic GCTs treated with 
cisplatin-based  chemotherapy  will  not  achieve  durable  disease  con-
trol. Most of these patients will experience disease progression within  
2  years  following  completion  of  chemotherapy.  The  International 
Prognostic Factors Study Group developed a risk stratification classifi-
cation system for patients in first relapse. Contributors to a worsened 
prognosis include NSGCT histology, extragonadal primary, incomplete 
response to first-line chemotherapy, time to relapse of 3 months or less, 
level of serum tumor markers at relapse, and the presence of nonpul-
monary visceral metastatic disease.

Patients  in  first  relapse  may  be  treated  with  either  conventional-
dose  salvage  chemotherapy  or  high-dose  salvage  chemotherapy  with 
autologous  stem  cell  rescue.  There  is  controversy  concerning  which 
approach is optimal. Some institutions advocate for risk stratification, 
with  more  favorable  prognosis  patients  receiving  conventional-dose 
chemotherapy and worse prognosis patients receiving high-dose che-
motherapy.  The  most  commonly  utilized  conventional-dose  regimen 
includes paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP). In one study of TIP 
in patients with more favorable-risk disease, approximately two-thirds 
experienced  2-year  progression-free  survival.  High-dose  chemother-
apy  consists  of  initial  salvage  therapy  followed  by  stem  cell  harvest 
and then two or three cycles of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide 
(CE) with stem cell rescue. The largest series of patients treated with 
high-dose  chemotherapy  was  reported  by  researchers  at  Indiana  
University where this approach is considered standard for most patients 
in first relapse regardless of risk classification. In their study, ∼70% of 
patients in first relapse achieved durable progression-free survival. A 
large  retrospective  analysis  has  compared  conventional-dose  salvage 
chemotherapy to high-dose salvage chemotherapy in patients in first 
relapse. This study reports a more favorable outcome with high-dose 
salvage  chemotherapy  across  nearly  all  risk  groups.  However,  given 
the retrospective nature of this study and the controversy concerning 
optimal  approaches,  an  international  randomized  trial  comparing  
conventional-dose  chemotherapy  (TIP)  to  high-dose  chemotherapy 
with autologous stem cell rescue (TI-CE) is underway.

Some patients who experience disease progression after conventional-
dose salvage chemotherapy may successfully be treated with high-dose sal-
vage chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Patients with disease 
progression  after  high-dose  salvage  chemotherapy  may  be  treated  with 
subsequent chemotherapy regimens that include gemcitabine/oxaliplatin, 
gemcitabine/paclitaxel,  epirubicin/cisplatin,  and  oral  etoposide.  While 
these  patients  may  benefit  from  third-line  chemotherapy,  few  will 
achieve durable disease control. Select patients with relapsed but resec-
table  disease  may  be  candidates  for  salvage  or  so-called  “desperation” 
surgery. Studies of molecularly targeted agents and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors in this population have to date been generally disappointing.
Patients who experience disease progression >2 years after chemo-
therapy  are  considered  to  have  “late  relapse.”  Late  relapse  appears  to 
have a different biology than early relapse. These patients tend to have 
more chemotherapy-resistant disease. Patients with late relapse usually 
have  NSGCT  with  elevation  of  serum  AFP.  Many  of  these  patients 
experience  recurrence  in  the  retroperitoneum  many  years  after  first-
line  chemotherapy,  and  this  likely  represents  residual  retroperitoneal 
disease that was not controlled after first-line therapy. These patients 
are best approached with salvage surgery.

 ■ EXTRAGONADAL GCTS
Approximately  5%  of  patients  who  present  with  GCTs  have  extrago-
nadal primaries. These mainly originate in the mediastinum or retro-
peritoneum. Patients suspected of extragonadal GCT should undergo 
scrotal ultrasound to exclude a gonadal primary. Extragonadal semi-
nomas have a similar excellent prognosis as their gonadal counterparts 
and  are  approached  the  same.  Mediastinal  NSGCTs  are  classified  as 
poor risk and are treated with either four cycles of BEP or four cycles 
of  VIP.  These  patients  frequently  require  postchemotherapy  thoracic 
surgery for residual disease. For this reason, some advocate avoiding 
bleomycin in this patient population. Klinefelter’s syndrome is associ-
ated with an increased risk of mediastinal NSGCTs. Rarely, mediastinal 

NSGCTs  are  associated  with  hematologic  disorders  including  acute 
myelogenous leukemia. NSGCTs arising in the retroperitoneum do not 
have a worse prognosis than their gonadal counterparts. Many patients 
who present with extragonadal GCTs will undergo core needle biopsy 
for diagnosis. However, select patients with extragonadal tumors and 
definitive elevation of serum tumor markers may initiate chemother-
apy without a tissue diagnosis.

Cancers  of  unknown  primary  are  defined  as  histologically  proven 
metastatic  malignancy  in  which  the  primary  site  is  not  obvious.  A 
subgroup  of  patients  with  cancer  of  unknown  primary  have  occult 
GCTs. Male gender, age <65 years, midline tumors, and nonsmoking 
status  increase  the  likelihood  of  this  presentation.  Pathology  may 
demonstrate a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Immunohis-
tochemical staining is used to exclude lymphoma. Tumor may be ana-
lyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for i(12p), which confirms 
the diagnosis. Even if the diagnosis is not certain, patients should be 
treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which will cure up to 20% 
of this patient group.

 ■ TESTICULAR NON–GERM CELL TUMORS
Rarely, patients may develop testicular non-GCTs. These include non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, most commonly occurring in men over the age 
of 50; sex cord stromal tumors including Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli 
cell  tumors;  mesothelioma  of  the  tunica  vaginalis;  and  paratesticular 
sarcoma. Metastasis to the testis is rare, most commonly occurring in 
patients with advanced prostate cancer and melanoma.

 ■ SURVIVORSHIP AND LATE EFFECTS
Because most patients with testicular GCT will experience long-term 
survival, survivorship care is important. Since many of these patients 
will be followed by primary care physicians, an understanding of the 
physical, psychological, and social late effects is important. Late effects 
are  defined  as  health  problems  that  occur  months  or  years  after  a 
disease is diagnosed or after treatment has ended. Late effects may be 
related to the underlying cancer or to the treatment the patient received. 
In long-term survivors of testicular GCT, increased cardiovascular risk 
and  increased  secondary  malignancies  have  been  reported.  Patients 
treated  with  cisplatin-based  chemotherapy  have  an  increased  risk  of 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular 
events. Patients treated with high cumulative doses of etoposide (e.g., 
patients who receive standard chemotherapy, relapse, and then receive 
salvage high-dose chemotherapy) may experience up to a 1–2% risk of 
developing acute myelogenous leukemia, typically 2–3 years after com-
pleting  therapy  and  associated  with  an  11q23  translocation.  Patients 
treated with radiation therapy, cisplatin-based chemotherapy, or both 
have an increased risk of developing secondary solid malignancies.

OVARIAN CANCER
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PATHOLOGY
Ovarian cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in American 
women,  ranking  behind  lung,  breast,  colon,  and  pancreatic  cancers. 
The  ovary  is  responsible  for  hormone  and  egg  production.  Between 
menarche  (11–13  years)  and  menopause  (45–55  years),  the  ovary  is 
responsible  for  follicle  maturation  associated  with  egg  maturation, 
ovulation,  and  cyclical  sex  steroid  hormone  production.  These  com-
plex biologic functions are linked to stromal and germ cells within the 
ovary. Cells of the ovary can be broadly grouped into stromal cells and 
ovarian  germ  cells  and  the  enveloping  epithelial  cells.  Malignancies 
arising  in  each  group  include  multiple  histologic  variants,  each  with 
unique neoplastic behaviors. Epithelial tumors are the most common 
histologic  variant  of  ovarian  neoplasms;  they  may  be  benign  (50%), 
frankly malignant (33%), or of borderline malignancy of low malignant 
potential  (16%).  In  adnexal  masses  detected  by  imaging  or  physical 
exam, age influences risk of malignancy; tumors in younger women are 
more likely benign. In the malignant group, the most common tumors 
are epithelial. In the group of the ovarian epithelial malignancies are 
the  serous  tumors  (60–70%),  mucinous  tumors  (10%),  endometrioid 
tumors  (10–15%),  and  clear  cell  tumors  (10–15%)  tumors.  The  dis-
tribution of histologic types varies in different parts of the world. The 
less common stromal tumors arise from the ancillary, supportive cells 
such  as  steroid  hormone–producing  cells  and  likewise  have  different 
phenotypes  and  clinical  presentations.  Most  stromal  tumors  do  not 
produce  estrogen,  but  ectopic  hormone  production  can  be  seen  in 
certain subtypes. Tumors arising in the ovarian germ cell lineage are 
generally similar in biology and behavior to testicular tumors in males, 
although  their  intraperitoneal  location  alters  some  metastatic  behav-
iors (Chap. 88). Ovarian tissue may also host metastatic tumors arising 
from breast, colon, gastric, and pancreatic primaries. Bilateral ovarian 
masses  from  metastatic  mucin-secreting  gastrointestinal  cancers  are 
termed  Krukenberg  tumors.  A  survey  of  other  potential  primaries  is 
commonly required during the diagnostic workup of ovarian masses.
 ■ OVARIAN CANCER OF EPITHELIAL ORIGIN
Epidemiology  An  American  woman  has  approximately  a  1  in  
72 lifetime risk (1.6%) of developing ovarian cancer, with the majority 
of affected women developing epithelial tumors. In 2021 in the United 
States, ~21,500 cases of ovarian cancer are expected to be diagnosed, 
with  >14,000  deaths.  Sporadic  (not  familial)  epithelial  tumors  of  the 
ovary  have  a  peak  incidence  in  women  in  their  fifties  and  sixties, 
although  age  at  presentation  ranges  from  the  third  decade  to  the 
eighties and nineties. Ovarian cancer risk has been linked to an inter-
active  mixture  of  epidemiologic,  environmental,  and  genetic  factors. 
Nulliparity, obesity, diet, infertility treatments, and possibly hormone 
replacement therapy have all been linked to an increase in risk. Pro-
tective factors include the use of oral contraceptives, multiparity, tubal 
ligation,  aspirin  use,  and  breast-feeding.  Other  epidemiologic  factors 
such as the historical use of perineal talc agents remain controversial. 
The mechanisms underlying the various protective factors are largely 
unknown,  but  theories  include  suppression  of  ovulation,  modulation 
of  gonadotropins  and  progestins,  and  perhaps  reduction  of  ovarian 
inflammation  and  damage  associated  with  the  repair  of  the  ovarian 
cortex associated with ovulation.

Genetics  and  Pathogenesis  Ovarian  cancers  are  divided  into 
type 1 cancers and the more aggressive type 2 variant. The type 1 can-
cers  are  characterized  by  low-grade  histology  and  generally  indolent 
behavior.  These  tumors  include  the  low  malignant  potential  tumors,

low-grade  endometrial  and  mucinous  histologies,  and  clear  cell  can-
cers (which are more aggressive). Genetic alterations in type 1 cancers 
include  mutations  in  KRAS,  BRAF,  PTEN,  and  PIK3CA.  In  contrast, 
studies have implicated serial genetic changes in the fallopian tube as 
the actual site of origin for most type 2, high-grade serous epithelial 
ovarian cancers. These aggressive tumors are more common and linked 
to losses in TP53 and defective DNA repair. Carcinoma in situ has been 
identified  in  the  tubal  epithelium  with  early  losses  in  TP53  and  the 
BRCA1/BRCA2 gene function characterizing early tubal intraepithelial 
cancers. Following these early genetic events, additional mutations in 
these  transformed  cells  lead  to  tumor  cell  shedding,  metastasis,  and 
invasion.  These  type  2,  poorly  differentiated,  serous  cancer  cells  can 
then spread to the ovaries and the peritoneal cavity, aided by the ovar-
ian cancer cell’s affinity for mesothelin-expressing cells.

Type 2 serous ovarian cancer is classically a disease characterized by 
widespread amplifications and deletions rather than single-gene point 
mutations or common gene fusions. In the Tumor Genome Atlas, loss 
of tumor-suppressor gene TP53 function is present in >95% of serous 
ovarian cancers. Damage to homologous DNA repair genes, especially 
BRCA1 and BRCA2, is also common in these tumors. Low prevalence 
but  statistically  recurrent  somatic  mutations  in  seven  other  genes 
including  NF1,  RB1,  and  CDK12  were  also  seen.  The  most  common 
heritable abnormality linked to ovarian cancer is a germline mutation 
in  either  BRCA1  (chromosome  17q12–21)  or  BRCA2  (chromosome 
13q12–13).  These  genes  are  essential  parts  of  the  homologous  DNA 
repair machinery for double-stranded DNA break repair. Individuals 
inheriting a single copy of a mutant allele have an increased lifetime 
risk  of  breast  (46–87%  for  BRCA1;  38–84%  for  BRCA2)  and  ovarian 
cancer  (39–63%  for  BRCA1;  16.5–27%  for  BRCA2).  Many  of  these 
women have a family history that includes multiple cases of breast and/
or ovarian cancer of at an early age. Male breast cancer, pancreatic can-
cer, and prostate cancer are also linked to familial BRCA2 mutations. 
The most common malignancy in women carrying germline BRCA1/2 
mutations  is  breast  carcinoma,  although  women  harboring  germline 
BRCA1  mutations  also  have  a  marked  increased  risk  of  developing 
ovarian  malignancies  in  their  forties  and  fifties.  Women  harboring  a 
mutation  in  BRCA2  have  a  lower  penetrance  of  ovarian  cancer  with 
onset  typically  in  their  fifties  or  sixties.  Other  uncommon  germline 
mutation  of  other  genes  encoding  proteins  linked  to  homologous 
DNA repair (e.g., PALB2) can also contribute to cancer risk, although 
the frequency of mutation and magnitude of risk increment are much 
lower  and  not  well  defined.  Screening  studies,  even  in  the  mutated 
BRCA1/2  families,  suggest  that  any  of  the  available  screening  tech-
niques,  including  structured,  serial  evaluation  of  the  CA-125  serum 
marker  and  transvaginal  ultrasound,  remain  insufficient  to  reliably 
detect  early-stage  ovarian  cancer  in  prospective  testing.  Germline 
BRCA1/2  testing  is  recommended  for  all  incident  epithelial  ovarian 
cancers  to  detect  probands  for  therapeutic  intervention  and  identify 
relatives at risk. Women with these high-risk germline mutations are 
advised to undergo prophylactic removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries 
after completing childbearing, ideally before age 40. Early prophylactic  
salpingo-oophorectomy  is  highly  protective.  Salpingo-oophorectomy 
also appears to protect these women from subsequent breast cancer (risk 
reduction  50%).  Prophylactic  salpingectomy  is  almost  certainly  a  key 
part of any surgical prophylaxis strategy for ovarian cancer prevention, 
but  the  benefits  of  isolated  oophorectomy  on  either  ovarian  or  breast 
cancer risk have not yet been clearly defined. Although less common, 
ovarian  cancer  is  also  another  familial  form  of  cancer  (along  with 
colorectal  and  endometrial  cancer)  that  may  develop  in  women  with  
type II Lynch syndrome caused by mutations in one of the DNA mis-
match repair genes (MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1, PMS2). Ovarian can-
cer may appear in women younger than 50 years of age in this syndrome.
Neoplasms  of  the  ovary  tend  to  be  painless  unless  they  undergo 
torsion. Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating and early 
satiety are common at presentation, probably related to compression of 
local organs or due to symptoms from metastatic disease. Women with 
ovarian  tumors  also  may  have  an  increased  incidence  of  symptoms 
including pelvic discomfort, bloating, and perhaps changes in urinary 
or bowel pattern. Unfortunately, all of these symptoms are common in

primary care and are frequently dismissed by either the woman or her 
health  care  team  until  later  stages  of  disease.  The  pathogenic  factors 
and timing of spread beyond the ovary are still not well understood. 
The  most  common  symptoms  at  presentation  of  advanced  disease 
include  a  period  of  progressive  complaints  of  nausea,  early  satiety, 
bloating, indigestion, constipation, and abdominal pain. Signs include 
the rapid increase in abdominal girth due to the accumulation of ascites 
that typically alerts the patient and her physician that the concurrent 
gastrointestinal symptoms are likely associated with malignant pathol-
ogy.  Radiologic  evaluation  typically  demonstrates  a  complex  adnexal 
mass with ascites, carcinomatosis, and pelvic, para-aortic and mesen-
teric adenopathy in advanced disease. Positron emission tomography 
(PET)  scans  are  generally  not  required.  Laboratory  evaluation  often 
demonstrates a markedly elevated CA-125, a shed mucin component 
(MUC16) associated with, but not specific for, ovarian cancer. Ovarian 
cancers are divided into four stages, with stage I tumors confined to the 
ovary, stage II malignancies confined to the pelvis, and stage III con-
fined to the peritoneal cavity and retroperitoneal nodes (Table 89-1). 
These  three  stages  are  subdivided,  with  the  most  common  presenta-
tion, stage IIIC, defined as tumors with bulky intraperitoneal disease or 
positive lymph node involvement. About 70% of women present with 
stage III disease. Stage IV disease includes women with parenchymal 
metastases (liver, lung, spleen) or, alternatively, abdominal wall or pleu-
ral disease. The 30% of patients not presenting with stage III disease are 
roughly evenly distributed among the other stages.

Screening  Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal condition. It is curable 
in early stages but seldom curable in advanced stages; hence, screen-
ing continues to be of considerable interest. Early-stage tumors often 
secrete  excessive  amounts  of  normal  proteins  that  can  be  measured 
in  the  serum  such  as  CA-125,  mesothelin,  and  HE-4.  Nevertheless, 
the incidence of ovarian cancer in the middle-aged female population 
is very low, with only ~1 in 2000 women between the ages of 50 and 
60  carrying  an  asymptomatic  and  undetected  tumor.  Thus,  effective 
screening  techniques  must  be  both  sensitive  and  highly  specific  to 
minimize the number of false positives. Panels of serum markers have 
not  improved  on  CA-125  alone,  nor  have  risk  assessment  strategies 
using algorithms with multiple CA-125 measurements over time. No 
other screening strategies have been any more successful to date. Some 
large studies have suggested that low-specificity screening might even 
worsen  mortality  in  the  screened  population.  Screening  for  ovarian 
cancer  is  currently  not  recommended  outside  of  a  clinical  trial,  but 
large ongoing clinical trials are studying algorithmic detection by serial 
sampling strategies.

TREATMENT
Ovarian Cancer

Epithelial  ovarian  cancer  can  be  divided  into  distinct  “disease 
states”  for  the  purpose  of  treatment  selection,  as  shown  in   
Fig. 89-1. Surgery by a skilled gynecologic oncologist remains the 
preferred initial therapy for ovarian cancer. However, the amount 
of  residual  visible  cancer  at  the  end  of  a  primary  operation  is 

strongly predictive of outcome and is paired with histology, grade, 
and stage to determine prognosis and treatment. In women pre-
senting  with  a  localized  ovarian  mass,  the  principal  diagnostic 
and  therapeutic  maneuver  is  abdominal  surgery  to  determine  if 
the tumor is benign or malignant. In the event that the tumor is 
malignant, the surgical specimen will determine if the tumor arises 
in the ovary or is a site of metastatic disease. Metastatic disease to 
the ovary can be seen from primary tumors of the colon, appen-
dix,  stomach  (Krukenberg  tumors),  and  breast.  Needle  biopsy  is 
contraindicated  to  avoid  malignant  contamination  of  the  peri-
toneal  cavity  with  malignant  cells.  Typically,  women  undergo 
laparoscopic evaluation and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for 
diagnostic purposes. If pathology reveals a primary ovarian malig-
nancy or the laparoscopy proves disseminated disease is present, 
then  the  procedure  should  be  followed  by  a  total  hysterectomy, 
removal of the remaining tube and ovary, omentectomy, and pelvic 
node sampling along with biopsies of the peritoneal cavity and dia-
phragms. This extensive surgical procedure is performed because 
~30% of tumors that, by visual inspection, appear to be confined to 
the ovary have already disseminated to the peritoneal cavity and/
or surrounding lymph nodes. As with axillary dissections in breast 
cancer,  node  sampling  is  diagnostic,  but  full  lymphadenectomy 
appears  to  provide  little  or  no  additional  therapeutic  advantage 
over  nodal  sampling.  The  target  outcome  of  an  ovarian  cancer 
surgery is always an R0 resection, with no visible residual cancer. 
The less favorable “optimal resection” (no disease >1 cm in size) is 
still clinically useful, and the prognosis of those patients is much 
better than that of patients who are left with >1 cm of disease at 
the end of surgery. These “suboptimally debulked” patients derive 
very little benefit from their surgery. If a suboptimal debulking is 
anticipated, the surgery should be delayed until after several cycles 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Such “interval debulking” surgery 
achieves  similar  results  to  primary  surgery  with  diminished  sur-
gical morbidity and more timely chemotherapy. Patients without 
gross  residual  disease  after  resection  have  a  median  survival  in 
excess  of  60  months,  compared  to  28–42  months  for  those  left 
with macroscopic tumor or those undergoing interval debulking, 
regardless of treatment strategy.

After appropriate surgical treatment, primary chemotherapy will 
consist  of  combination  treatment  with  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin. 
Primary chemotherapy can be delivered intravenously, or alterna-
tively, some therapy can be directly administered into the peritoneal 
cavity  via  an  indwelling  catheter.  Some,  but  not  all,  randomized 
studies have demonstrated improved survival with intraperitoneal 
(IP)  therapy.  The  IP  approach  is  technically  more  difficult  and  is 
increasingly replaced by carboplatin and paclitaxel, which appears 
to offer similar results.

With  optimal  debulking  surgery  and  platinum-based  chemo-
therapy  (usually  carboplatin  dosed  to  an  area  under  the  curve 
[AUC] of 6.0 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 by 3-h infusion in monthly 
cycles),  70%  of  women  who  present  with  advanced-stage  tumors 
show tumor reduction, and 40–50% experience a complete remis-
sion  with  normalization  of  their  CA-125,  CT  scans,  and  physical

Death From Disease

examination. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) such 
as  niriparib  or  olaparib,  when  administered  at  the  completion  of 
intravenous  chemotherapy,  appear  to  substantially  delay  recur-
rence  and  probably  provide  survival  advantages  as  well.  In  the 
majority of patients, disease still recurs within 1–4 years from the 
completion of their primary therapy. CA-125 levels often increase 
as  a  first  sign  of  relapse,  and  CT  scan  findings  are  confirmatory. 
Recurrent  disease  is  often  successfully  managed  for  years,  but 
rarely cured, with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Additional 
surgical therapy does not appear to extend survival in randomized 
trials. Patients with a treatment-free interval are often best treated 
with  additional  platinum  doublets,  combining  carboplatin  with 
liposomal  doxorubicin,  gemcitabine,  or  a  taxane.  Eventually  all 
women  who  experience  relapse  develop  chemotherapy-refractory 
disease.  Refractory  ascites,  poor  bowel  motility,  and  obstruction 
or tumor-infiltrated aperistaltic bowel are all common premorbid 
events.  Limited  surgery  to  relieve  intestinal  obstruction,  local-
ized  radiation  therapy  to  relieve  pressure  or  pain  from  masses, 
or  palliative  chemotherapy  may  be  helpful.  Agents  with  >15% 
response rates include gemcitabine, topotecan, liposomal doxoru-
bicin, and bevacizumab. Five-year survival correlates with the stage 
of  disease:  stage  I,  90–95%;  stage  II,  70–80%;  stage  III,  25–40%; 
stage  IV,  10–15%  (Table  89-1).  Prognosis  is  also  influenced  by 
histologic  grade:  5-year  survival  is  88%  for  well-differentiated 
tumors,  58%  for  moderately  differentiated  tumors,  and  27%  for 
poorly differentiated tumors. Histologic type has less influence on  
outcome.

 ■ UNCOMMON OVARIAN TUMORS
Low  Malignant  Potential  Tumors  (Borderline  Tumors)  
These type 1 tumors are found in younger women (age 30–50 years) 
and  indolent  in  behavior,  and  few  of  these  patients  will  succumb  to 

their  tumors  (10-year  survival  may  approach  98%),  although  recur-
rence  is  not  uncommon.  Certain  features,  such  as  micropapillary 
histology and microinvasion, are linked to more aggressive behavior. 
Tumors  of  low  malignant  potential  should  be  carefully  distinguished 
from grade 1 serous carcinomas. Borderline tumor patients are man-
aged primarily by surgery; chemotherapy and radiation therapy do not 
substantially alter survival.

Stromal  Tumors  Approximately  7%  of  ovarian  neoplasms  are 
stromal  tumors,  with  ~1800  cases  expected  each  year  in  the  United 
States. Ovarian stromal tumors or sex cord tumors are most common 
in  women  in  their  fifties  or  sixties,  but  tumors  can  present  at  any 
age.  These  tumors  arise  from  the  mesenchymal  components  of  the 
ovary,  including  both  steroid-producing  cells  and  fibroblasts.  Most 
of these tumors are indolent tumors with limited metastatic potential 
and  present  as  unilateral  solid  masses.  These  tumors  primarily  are 
discovered  by  the  detection  of  an  abdominal  mass,  sometimes  with 
abdominal pain due to ovarian torsion, intratumoral hemorrhage, or 
rupture. Rarely, stromal tumors can produce estrogen and present with 
breast tenderness as well as precocious puberty in children, menstrual 
disturbances  in  reproductively  active  women,  or  postmenopausal 
bleeding.  In  some  women,  estrogen-associated  secondary  malignan-
cies, such as endometrial or breast cancer, may present as synchronous 
malignancies. Sertoli-Leydig tumors often present with hirsutism and 
virilization  due  to  increased  production  of  androgens.  Hormonally 
inert tumors include fibromas, which present as solitary masses often 
in association with ascites and occasionally hydrothorax, also known 
as Meigs’s syndrome. A subset of these tumors present in individuals 
with  a  variety  of  inherited  disorders  that  predispose  them  to  mes-
enchymal neoplasia including Ollier’s disease (juvenile granulosa cell 
tumors) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (ovarian sex cord tumors). The 
treatment of these tumors is almost exclusively by surgical resection, 
without adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy with carboplatin and

698

paclitaxel  is  generally  reserved  for  either  unresectable  or  multiply 
recurrent tumors.

Germ  Cell  Tumors  of  the  Ovary  Germ  cell  tumors,  like  their 
counterparts  in  the  testis,  are  cancers  of  germ  cells.  These  totipotent 
cells contain the programming for differentiation to essentially all tis-
sue types, and hence, the germ cell tumors include a histologic menag-
erie  of  bizarre  tumors,  including  benign  teratomas  (dermoid  cysts) 
and a variety of malignant tumors, such as dysgerminoma, immature 
teratomas,  yolk  sac  malignancies,  and  choriocarcinomas.  Benign  ter-
atoma (or dermoid cyst) is the most common germ cell neoplasm of 
the ovary and often presents in young women. These tumors include a 
complex mixture of differentiated tissue including tissues from all three 
germ layers. In older women, these differentiated tumors can develop 
malignant transformation, most commonly squamous cell carcinomas. 
Malignant germ cell tumors include dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, 
immature  teratomas,  and  embryonal  and  choriocarcinomas.  Germ 
cell  tumors  can  present  at  all  ages,  but  the  peak  age  of  presentation 
tends  to  be  in  adolescents.  Typically,  these  tumors  will  become  large 
ovarian  masses,  which  eventually  present  as  palpable  low  abdominal 
or  pelvic  masses.  Like  sex  cord  tumors,  torsion  or  hemorrhage  may 
present  urgently  or  emergently  as  acute  abdominal  pain.  Some  germ 
cell tumors produce elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) or α-fetoprotein (AFP). Unlike epithelial ovarian cancer, these 
tumors have a higher proclivity for nodal or hematogenous metastases. 
Germ cell tumors typically present in women who are of childbearing 
age, and because bilateral tumors are uncommon (except in dysgermi-
noma,  10–15%),  the  typical  treatment  is  unilateral  oophorectomy  or 
salpingo-oophorectomy with lymph node sampling. Most commonly, 
women  with  advanced  malignant  germ  cell  tumors  typically  receive 
bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy, in an analo-
gous fashion to the treatment of testicular cancers. In the majority of 
these women, even those with advanced-stage disease, cure is expected. 
Dysgerminoma is the ovarian counterpart of testicular seminoma and 
is  highly  curable.  Although  the  tumor  is  highly  radiation-sensitive, 
radiation produces infertility in many patients. BEP chemotherapy is 
as effective or more so without causing infertility.

FALLOPIAN TUBE CANCER
Transport of the egg to the uterus occurs through the fallopian tube, 
with  the  distal  ends  of  these  tubes  composed  of  fimbriae  that  drape 
about  the  ovarian  surface  and  capture  the  egg  as  it  erupts  from  the 
ovarian  cortex.  As  described  above,  the  majority  of  type  2  ovarian 
cancers are now thought to arise from the tubal epithelium. As might 
be  expected,  fallopian  tube  malignancies  are  typically  of  serous  his-
tology  and  share  the  same  biology  and  recommended  treatment  as 
serous ovarian cancer. These tumors often present as clinically isolated 
adnexal masses, but like ovarian cancer, these tumors spread relatively 
early throughout the peritoneal cavity. Fallopian tubal cancers have a 
natural history and treatment that are essentially identical to ovarian 
cancer (Table 89-1).

CERVICAL CANCER
 ■ ETIOLOGY AND GENETICS
Cervical  cancer  is  the  second  most  common  and  the  most  lethal 
malignancy  in  women  worldwide.  Infection  with  high-risk  strains 
of  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  is  the  primary  neoplastic-initiating 
event in the vast majority of women with invasive cervical cancer. This 
double-stranded DNA virus infects epithelium near the transformation 
zone  of  the  cervix  where  underlying  columnar  epithelium  becomes 
squamous  epithelium.  More  than  60  types  of  HPV  are  known,  with 
~20  types  having  the  ability  to  generate  high-grade  dysplasia  and 
malignancy.  HPV16  and  18  are  the  types  most  frequently  associated 
with  high-grade  dysplasia,  but  types  31,  33,  35,  52,  and  58  are  also 
considered  to  be  high-risk  variants.  The  large  majority  of  sexually 
active adults are exposed to HPV, and most women clear the infection 
without  specific  intervention.  The  8-kb  HPV  genome  encodes  seven 

early genes, most notably E6 and E7, which can bind to RB and p53, 
respectively. High-risk types of HPV encode E6 and E7 molecules that 
are particularly effective at inhibiting the normal cell cycle checkpoint 
functions of these regulatory proteins, leading to immortalization but 
not full transformation of cervical epithelium. A minority of women 
will fail to clear the infection, with subsequent HPV integration into 
the host genome. Over as little as a few months to several years, some 
of  these  persistently  infected  women  develop  worsening  dysplasia,  a 
premalignant condition that, untreated, can progress to cervical carci-
noma. Complete transformation to cancer occurs over a period of years 
and almost certainly requires the acquisition of other poorly defined 
genetic mutations within the infected and immortalized epithelium.

In 2018, ~570,000 new cases of cervical cancer occurred worldwide, 
with an estimated 311,000 deaths. Cancer incidence is particularly high 
in women residing in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and 
southern and eastern Africa. The mortality rate is disproportionately 
high in Africa. In the United States, an estimated 14,480 women will 
be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2021 and ~4290 women will die 
of the disease.

In  the  integrated  genomic  characterization  of  cervical  cancer  by 
The  Cancer  Genome  Atlas  (TCGA),  integration  of  HPV  sequences 
was  found  in  all  of  the  HPV18-linked  cancers  and  over  three-quarters 
of  the  HPV16  cancers.  The  cervical  tumors  also  showed  a  charac-
teristic  APOBEC  (apolipoprotein  B  mRNA  editing  enzyme,  catalytic  
polypeptide-like; a family of cytidine deaminases that edit DNA and are 
endogenous  mutagenic  enzymes)  pattern  of  mutagenesis,  with  ERBB3, 
CASP8, and TGFRB2 identified as significantly mutated genes presumably 
linked to progression from dysplasia to carcinoma. In the much smaller 
number  of  HPV-negative  cancers,  which  are  more  common  in  older 
women,  mutations  in  oncogenes  KRAS,  ARID1A,  and  PTEN  were  fre-
quently seen. The clinical behavior of these cancers is likely to be different.

 ■ HPV INFECTION AND PREVENTION
The  Pap  smear  is  the  primary  detection  method  for  asymptomatic 
preinvasive  cervical  dysplasia  of  squamous  epithelial  lining  during 
a  gynecologic  exam.  Because  the  delay  between  dysplasia  and  frank 
cervical  cancer  is  years  long,  annual  (or  longer)  screening  and  pre-
vention  strategies  that  detect  precancerous  dysplasia  and  carcinoma 
in situ can be implemented successfully. Annual or biannual cervical 
scraping  for  cytology  (Pap  smear)  is  highly  effective  in  reducing  the 
incidence of cervical cancer by early detection and subsequent surgical 
treatment of premalignant disease. The incorporation of HPV testing 
by  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  or  other  molecular  techniques 
increases the sensitivity of detecting cervical pathology but at the cost 
of  lower  sensitivity  in  that  it  identifies  many  women  with  transient 
infections who require no specific medical intervention. Unfortunately, 
both the collection of a Pap smear and its cytologic evaluation require 
infrastructure  beyond  the  means  of  many  middle-  and  low-income 
countries. High-throughput, low-technology prevention strategies and 
point-of-care testing are needed to identify and treat women bearing 
high-risk cervical dysplasia to prevent cancer development.

A  primary  prevention  strategy  relies  on  HPV  vaccines.  Currently 
approved  vaccines  include  the  recombinant  proteins  to  the  late  pro-
teins,  L1  and  L2  of  HPV16  and  18,  as  well  as  other,  less  common 
cancer-causing isotypes 11, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Vaccination of girls 
aged 11–13 years with two injections (1 year apart) before the initia-
tion of sexual activity dramatically reduces the rate of high-risk HPV 
infection and subsequent dysplasia. Vaccination of both boys and girls 
is increasingly considered to reduce the risk of HPV-induced cancers 
of the pharynx. Partial protection is also provided against other HPV 
types,  although  vaccinated  women  are  still  at  risk  for  HPV  infection 
and still benefit from standard Pap smear screening.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS
Risk  Factors  Clinical  risk  factors  include  many  HPV  infection–
linked  features:  a  high  number  of  sexual  partners,  early  age  of  first 
intercourse,  and  history  of  venereal  disease.  Smoking  is  a  cofactor; 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   698

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyheavy  smokers  have  a  higher  risk  of  dysplasia  with  HPV  infection. 
HIV  infection,  especially  when  associated  with  low  CD4+  T-cell 
counts,  is  associated  with  a  higher  rate  of  high-grade  dysplasia  and 
likely a shorter latency period between infection and invasive disease. 
Histologically, the majority of cervical malignancies are squamous cell 
carcinomas associated with HPV, but adenocarcinomas are also HPV 
related,  and  both  arise  in  the  transitional  zone  of  the  endocervical 
canal; the lesions in the canal or cervical glands may not be seen by 
visual inspection of the cervix and can be missed by Pap smear screen-
ing. Less common malignancies, such as vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and 
pharyngeal cancer, are also linked to HPV infection.
Diagnosis  of  Cervical  Cancer  Early  cancer  of  the  cervix  is 
asymptomatic,  and  this  biology  underlies  the  recommendations  for 
routine  gynecologic  care.  Larger,  invasive  carcinomas  often  have 
symptoms  or  signs  including  postcoital  spotting  or  intermenstrual 
cycle  bleeding  or  menometrorrhagia.  Foul-smelling  or  persistent  
yellow  discharge  may  also  be  present.  Symptoms  such  as  pelvic  or 
sacral  pain  suggest  lateral  extension  into  the  pelvic  nerve  plexus  by 
either  the  primary  tumor  or  a  pelvic  node  metastasis  and  indicate 
advanced-stage  disease.  Likewise,  flank  pain  from  hydronephrosis 
from ureteral compression or deep-venous thrombosis from iliac vessel 
compression suggests either extensive nodal disease or direct extension 
of the primary tumor to the pelvic sidewall. The most common finding 
upon physical exam is a visible tumor on the cervix, but deeper tumors 
in  the  cervical  os  and  glands  should  be  considered.  Larger  tumors 
may be identified by inspection and biopsied directly. Staging of cer-
vical cancer is performed by clinical exam. Stage I cervical tumors are 
confined to the cervix, whereas stage II tumors extend into the upper 
vagina or paracervical soft tissue (Fig. 89-2). Stage III tumors extend 
to  the  lower  vagina  or  the  pelvic  sidewalls,  whereas  stage  IV  tumors 
invade  the  bladder  or  rectum  or  have  spread  to  distant  sites.  While 
radiographic studies are not part of the formal clinical staging of cer-
vical cancer, treatment planning requires them for appropriate therapy. 
CT  can  detect  hydronephrosis  indicative  of  pelvic  sidewall  disease 
but is not accurate at evaluating other pelvic structures. MRI is more 
accurate at estimating uterine extension and paracervical extension of 
disease into soft tissues typically bordered by broad and cardinal liga-
ments that support the uterus in the central pelvis. Very small stage I 
cervical tumors can be treated with a variety of surgical procedures, but 
minimally invasive surgery has inferior outcome compared to standard 
open  hysterectomy.  In  young  women  desiring  to  maintain  fertility,

radical trachelectomy removes the cervix with subsequent anastomosis 
of the upper vagina to the uterine corpus; however, subsequent preg-
nancies may be more problematic. Patients with large stage I cervical 
tumors (4 cm) confined to the cervix and all stage II to IV patients are 
treated  with  radiation  therapy  in  combination  with  cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy.  This  multimodality  treatment  can  offer  the  patient 
with  advanced-stage  disease  a  40–80%  chance  of  cure  depending  on 
the  clinical  circumstances.  Platinum  agents  (cisplatin  or  carboplatin) 
combined  with  paclitaxel  and  bevacizumab  are  generally  considered 
as the best palliative choice for metastatic cervical cancer patients. Sec-
ondary chemotherapy confers minimal improvement in most patients. 
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive T-cell 
therapies are promising avenues for improved outcomes in recurrent, 
unresectable cancers of the cervix.

UTERINE CANCER
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Several different tumor types arise in the uterine corpus. Most tumors 
arise  in  the  glandular  lining  and  are  endometrial  adenocarcinomas. 
Benign  (leiomyomas)  and  malignant  tumors  (leiomyosarcomas)  can 
also arise in the uterine smooth muscle and have very different clinical 
features.  The  endometrioid  histologic  subtype  is  the  most  common 
gynecologic  malignancy  in  the  United  States.  In  2021,  the  American 
Cancer Society predicted that 66,570 new cancers of the uterine corpus 
in  2021  with  12,940  resulting  deaths.  Development  of  these  tumors 
is  a  multistep  process,  with  estrogen  playing  an  important  early  role 
in  driving  endometrial  gland  proliferation.  Relative  overexposure  to 
this  class  of  hormones  is  the  principal  risk  factor  for  the  subsequent 
development  of  endometrioid  tumors.  In  contrast,  progestins  drive 
glandular  maturation  and  are  protective.  Hence,  women  with  high 
endogenous  or  pharmacologic  exposure  to  estrogens,  especially  if 
unopposed by progesterone, are at higher risk for endometrial cancer. 
Obese  women,  women  treated  with  postmenopausal  estrogens,  or 
women with estrogen-producing tumors are at higher risk for endome-
trial  cancer.  In  addition,  long-term  treatment  with  tamoxifen,  which 
has antiestrogenic effects in breast tissue but can show weak estrogenic 
effects  in  uterine  epithelium,  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
endometrial cancer.

Genetics  Women  with  a  germline  mutation  in  one  of  a  series  of 
DNA  mismatch  repair  genes  associated  with  the  Lynch  syndrome, 
also  known  as  hereditary  nonpolyposis 
colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome, are at 
increased risk for endometrioid endome-
trial  carcinoma.  These  individuals  have 
germline  mutations  in  MSH2,  MLH1, 
and,  in  rare  cases,  PMS1  and  PMS2. 
Individuals  who  carry  these  mutations 
typically have a family history of cancer 
and  are  at  markedly  increased  risk  for 
colon  cancer  and  modestly  increased 
risk  for  ovarian  cancer  and  a  variety 
of  other  tumors.  Middle-aged  women 
with  HNPCC  carry  a  4%  annual  risk 
of  endometrial  cancer  and  a  relative 
overall risk of ~200-fold as compared to 
age-matched  women  without  HNPCC. 
In  sporadic  cancers,  secondary  events 
such  as  mutation  of  the  PI3K  gene  or 
the  loss  of  the  PTEN  tumor-suppressor 
gene  likely  serve  as  secondary  genetic 
“hits”  in  the  carcinogenesis  related  to 
estrogenic  excess.  The  molecular  events 
that  underlie  less  common  endometrial 
cancers  such  as  clear  cell  and  papillary 
serous tumors of the uterine corpus are 
not well understood.

 ■ PATHOLOGY
Approximately  75–80%  of  endometrial  cancers  are  adenocarcinomas 
and  have  been  characterized  as  type  1  (estrogen-linked)  endome-
trial cancers and type 2 cancers that have less clear associations with 
estrogens  (clear  cell  cancers,  serous  cancers,  and  mucinous  cancers). 
Endometrial  serous  cancers  show  TP53  loss  of  function  and  behave 
clinically more like ovarian cancers with high risk for systemic recur-
rence. Prognosis for endometrial cancer depends on stage, histologic 
grade, and depth of myometrial invasion.
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
The majority of women with tumors of the uterine corpus present with 
postmenopausal  vaginal  bleeding  due  to  shedding  of  the  malignant 
endometrial  lining.  Premenopausal  women  often  will  present  with 
atypical  bleeding  between  typical  menstrual  cycles.  These  signs  typi-
cally bring a woman to the attention of a health care professional, and 
the  majority  of  women  present  with  early-stage  disease  in  which  the 
tumor is confined to the uterine corpus and, consequently, have a high 
cure rate. Diagnosis is typically established by endometrial biopsy. Type 
1 tumors may spread to pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes and are gen-
erally subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of primary 
surgery.  Serous  tumors  tend  to  have  patterns  of  spread  much  more 
reminiscent of ovarian cancer, and patients may present with omental/
peritoneal disease and sometimes ascites. Some women with endome-
trial cancer have a history of endometriosis. Some women presenting 
with uterine sarcomas will present with pelvic pain. Uterine sarcomas 
(carcinosarcomas  and  leiomyosarcomas)  commonly  are  found  by 
detection of symptomatic large pelvic masses that may or may not be 
associated with dysfunctional bleeding.

TREATMENT
Uterine Cancer

Most  women  with  endometrial  cancer  have  disease  that  is  local-
ized  to  the  uterus  (75%  are  stage  I,  Table  89-1),  and  definitive 
treatment  typically  involves  a  hysterectomy  with  removal  of  the 
ovaries and fallopian tubes. The resection of lymph nodes does not 
improve outcome, but sentinel node resection provides important 
staging  and  prognostic  information.  Node  involvement  defines 
stage IIIC disease. Tumor grade and depth of invasion are the two 
key  prognostic  variables  in  early-stage  tumors,  and  women  with 
low-grade  and/or  minimally  invasive  tumors  (<50%  myometrial 
penetration) are typically observed after definitive surgical therapy. 
Patients with high-grade tumors or tumors that are deeply invasive 
(stage  IB)  are  at  higher  risk  for  pelvic  recurrence  or  recurrence 
at  the  vaginal  cuff,  which  is  typically  prevented  by  intravaginal 
brachytherapy.

The  loss  of  one  or  more  mismatch  repair  proteins  results  in 
microsatellite  instability  (MSI)  with  a  larger  number  of  muta-
tions in the tumor. MSI testing should be routinely performed in 
endometrial cancers at the time of diagnosis to help with current 
and future treatment plans. MSI cancers, when recurrent or present 
at an advanced stage, are likely to respond to immune checkpoint 
therapy.  Women  with  regional  metastases  or  metastatic  disease 
(3%  of  patients)  with  low-grade  tumors  can  be  treated  with  pro-
gesterone or tamoxifen. Poorly differentiated tumors lack hormone 
receptors  and  are  typically  resistant  to  hormonal  manipulation. 
The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I–II disease is generally 
restricted to serous endometrial cancers. For more advanced-stage 
cancers  (stage  III–IV),  chemotherapy  and/or  immune  checkpoint 
blockade are administered because of the higher rates of recurrent 
systemic disease. Carboplatin and paclitaxel combinations are the 
current  standard  of  care.  Chemotherapy  for  metastatic  disease  is 
delivered with palliative intent. Patients with advanced cancer and 
known  mismatch  repair  deficits  may  respond  particularly  well  to 
immunotherapy with antagonists of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Lenva-
tinib  and  pembrolizumab  (even  for  microsatellite-stable  tumors) 

have become the most common second-line treatments, although 
survival  data  are  not  yet  available.  Other  potentially  active  treat-
ments include bevacizumab, mTOR inhibitors (e.g., temsirolimus), 
and  anthracyclines.  Carcinosarcomas  of  the  uterus  (also  called   
Müllerian tumors) contain both mesenchymal and epithelial com-
ponents  but  will  often  respond  to  paclitaxel  and  platinum  com-
plex  therapy.  Other  uterine  sarcomas  require  an  entirely  different 
approach  and  need  histology-specific  consideration.  The  most 
common are the leiomyosarcomas of the uterus, which are treated 
with docetaxel/gemcitabine at recurrence but do not appear to ben-
efit from adjuvant therapy. Ifosfamide/doxorubicin and trabectedin 
can have some benefit in refractory disease.

GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC TUMORS
Gestational  trophoblastic  diseases  represent  a  spectrum  of  neoplasia 
from benign hydatidiform mole to choriocarcinoma due to persistent 
trophoblastic  disease  associated  most  commonly  with  molar  preg-
nancy but occasionally seen after normal gestation. The most common 
presentations of trophoblastic tumors are partial and complete molar 
pregnancies. These represent approximately 1 in 1500 conceptions in 
developed  Western  countries.  The  incidence  widely  varies  globally, 
with areas in Southeast Asia having a much higher incidence of molar 
pregnancy. Regions with high molar pregnancy rates are often associ-
ated with diets low in carotene and animal fats.

 ■ RISK FACTORS
Trophoblastic  tumors  result  from  the  outgrowth  or  persistence  of 
placental tissue. They arise most commonly in the uterus but can also 
arise in other sites such as the fallopian tubes due to ectopic pregnancy. 
Risk factors include poorly defined dietary and environmental factors 
as  well  as  conceptions  at  the  extremes  of  reproductive  age,  with  the 
incidence particularly high in females conceiving at younger than age 
16 or older than age 50. In older women, the incidence of molar preg-
nancy might be as high as one in three, likely due to increased risk of 
abnormal fertilization of the aged ova. Most trophoblastic neoplasms 
are  associated  with  complete  moles,  diploid  tumors  with  all  genetic 
material from the paternal donor (known as uniparental disomy). This 
is thought to occur when a single sperm fertilizes an enucleate egg that 
subsequently duplicates the paternal DNA. Trophoblastic proliferation 
occurs with exuberant villous stroma. If pseudopregnancy extends out 
past the 12th week, fluid progressively accumulates within the stroma, 
leading  to  “hydropic  changes.”  Fetal  development  does  not  occur  in 
complete moles.

Partial moles arise from the fertilization of an egg with two sperm 
cells; hence, two-thirds of genetic material is paternal in these triploid 
tumors.  Hydropic  changes  are  less  dramatic,  and  fetal  development 
can often occur through late first trimester or early second trimester, 
at which point spontaneous abortion is common. Laboratory findings 
will  include  excessively  high  human  chorionic  gonadotropin  (hCG) 
and high AFP. The risk of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease 
after partial mole is ~5%. Complete and partial moles can be noninva-
sive or invasive. Myometrial invasion occurs in no more than one in six 
complete moles and a lower portion of partial moles.

 ■ PRESENTATION OF INVASIVE TROPHOBLASTIC 
DISEASE
The clinical presentation of molar pregnancy is changing in developed 
countries due to the early detection of pregnancy with home pregnancy 
kits and the very early use of Doppler and ultrasound to evaluate the 
early  fetus  and  uterine  cavity  for  evidence  of  a  viable  fetus.  Thus,  in 
these countries, the majority of women presenting with trophoblastic 
disease have their moles detected early and have typical symptoms of 
early  pregnancy  including  nausea,  amenorrhea,  and  breast  tender-
ness.  With  uterine  evacuation  of  early  complete  and  partial  moles, 
most  women  experience  spontaneous  remission  of  their  disease  as 
monitored  by  serial  serum  β-hCG  levels.  These  women  require  no

PART 4Oncology and Hematologychemotherapy.  Patients  with  persistent  elevation  of  β-hCG  or  rising 
β-hCG after uterine evacuation have persistent or actively growing ges-
tational trophoblastic disease and require therapy. Most series suggest 
that  between  15  and  25%  of  women  will  have  evidence  of  persistent 
gestational trophoblastic disease after molar evacuation.

In  women  who  lack  access  to  prenatal  care,  presenting  symptoms 
can  be  life-threatening,  including  the  development  of  preeclampsia 
or even eclampsia. Hyperthyroidism can also be seen with very high 
β-hCG  values.  Evacuation  of  large  moles  can  be  associated  with 
life-threatening  complications  including  uterine  perforation,  volume 
loss,  high-output  cardiac  failure,  and  adult  respiratory  distress  syn-
drome (ARDS).

For  women  with  evidence  of  rising  β-hCG  or  radiologic  confir-
mation  of  metastatic  or  persistent  regional  disease,  prognosis  can  be 
estimated through a variety of scoring algorithms that identify women 
at low, intermediate, and high risk for requiring multiagent chemother-
apy. In general, women with widely metastatic nonpulmonary disease, 
very elevated β-hCG, and prior normal antecedent term pregnancy are 
considered at high risk and typically require multiagent chemotherapy 
at  an  expert  center  for  cure.  Even  very  advanced  gestational  tropho-
blastic disease is almost uniformly curable when managed by an expert 
in this rare malignancy.

TREATMENT
Invasive Trophoblastic Disease

Management  of  invasive  trophoblastic  disease  should  be  100% 
curative,  and  complex  patients  should  be  managed  by  clinicians 
experienced  in  this  disease.  The  management  for  a  persistent  and 
rising  β-hCG  after  evacuation  of  a  molar  conception  is  typically 
chemotherapy, although surgery can play an important role for che-
motherapy-resistant disease that is isolated in the uterus (especially 
if childbearing is complete) or to control hemorrhage. For women 
wishing to maintain fertility or with metastatic disease, the preferred 
treatment is chemotherapy. Trophoblastic disease is exquisitely sen-
sitive to chemotherapy, and guided by serial serum β-hCG testing, 
successful,  curative  treatment  is  the  rule.  Single-agent  treatment 
with dactinomycin or methotrexate cures 90% of women with low-
risk disease. Patients with high-risk disease (very high β-hCG levels, 
presentation ≥4 months after pregnancy, brain or liver metastases, 
failure  of  methotrexate  therapy)  are  typically  treated  with  multi-
agent  chemotherapy  (etoposide,  methotrexate,  and  dactinomycin, 
alternating  with  cyclophosphamide  and  vincristine  [EMA-CO]), 
which is typically curative even in women with extensive metastatic 
disease.  A  regimen  of  cisplatin  and  etoposide  alternating  with 
etoposide/methotrexate/dactinomycin  is  used  for  the  highest-risk 
patients.  In  the  highest-risk  patients  with  liver,  lung,  and  brain 
metastases, hemorrhage from the rich tumor vasculature is a major 
risk  during  chemotherapy  initiation.  Cured  women  may  become 
pregnant  again  without  evidence  of  increased  fetal  or  maternal 
complications.

90 Primary and Metastatic 
Tumors of the Nervous  
System
Lisa M. DeAngelis, Patrick Y. Wen

An  estimated  87,000  people  will  be  diagnosed  with  a  primary  brain 
tumor  annually  in  the  United  States.  At  least  25,000  of  these  tumors 
are malignant, and most of these are gliomas. Meningiomas account for 
35%, vestibular schwannomas 10%, and central nervous system (CNS) 
lymphomas ~2%. Brain metastases are three times more common than 
all  primary  brain  tumors  combined  and  are  diagnosed  in  ~150,000 
people each year. Metastases to the leptomeninges and epidural space 
of the spinal cord each occur in ~3–5% of patients with systemic cancer 
and are also a major cause of neurologic disability.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Primary and Metastatic Tumors of the Nervous 
System 

CLINICAL FEATURES
Brain tumors of any type can present with a variety of symptoms 
and  signs  that  fall  into  two  categories:  general  and  focal;  patients 
often have a combination of the two (Table 90-1). General symp-
toms include headache, with or without nausea or vomiting, cog-
nitive  difficulties,  personality  change,  and  gait  disorder.  These 
symptoms  arise  when  the  enlarging  tumor  and  its  surrounding 
edema  cause  an  increase  in  intracranial  pressure  or  compression 
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation leading to hydrocephalus. 
The classic brain tumor headache predominates in the morning and 
improves during the day, but this pattern is seen in a minority of 
patients. Headaches are often holocephalic but can be ipsilateral to 
the side of a tumor. Occasionally, headaches have features of a typ-
ical migraine with unilateral throbbing pain associated with visual 
scotoma. Personality changes may include apathy and withdrawal 
from social situations, mimicking depression. Focal or lateralizing 
findings include hemiparesis, aphasia, or visual field defect. Later-
alizing symptoms are typically subacute and progressive; language 
difficulties may be mistaken for confusion. Seizures are common, 
occurring in ~25% of patients with brain metastases or malignant 
gliomas, and are the presenting symptom in up to 90% of patients 
with  a  low-grade  glioma.  All  seizures  arising  from  a  brain  tumor 
will have a focal onset whether or not it is apparent clinically. 

NEUROIMAGING
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred diag-
nostic test for any patient suspected of having a brain tumor and 
should  be  performed  with  gadolinium  contrast  administration. 
Computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  should  be  reserved  for  those 
patients unable to undergo MRI. Malignant brain tumors—whether 
primary  or  metastatic—typically  enhance  with  gadolinium,  have 
central areas of necrosis, and are surrounded by edema of the neigh-
boring  white  matter.  Low-grade  gliomas  usually  do  not  enhance 
with gadolinium and are best appreciated on fluid-attenuated inver-
sion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences. Meningiomas have a typical 
appearance on MRI because they are dural-based enhancing tumors 
with a dural tail and compress but do not invade the brain. Dural 
metastases  or  a  dural  lymphoma  can  have  a  similar  appearance. 
Imaging is characteristic for many primary and metastatic tumors 
and  sometimes  will  suffice  to  establish  a  diagnosis  when  the 
location  precludes  surgical  intervention  (e.g.,  brainstem  glioma).

Functional MRI is useful in presurgical planning to define eloquent 
sensory, motor, or language cortex. Positron emission tomography 
(PET) is useful in determining the metabolic activity of the lesions 
seen  on  MRI;  MR  perfusion  and  spectroscopy  can  provide  infor-
mation on blood flow or tissue composition. These techniques may 
help  distinguish  tumor  progression  from  tissue  necrosis  due  to 
treatment  with  radiation  and  chemotherapy.  Neuroimaging  is  the 
only test necessary to diagnose a brain tumor. Laboratory tests are 
rarely  useful,  although  patients  with  metastatic  disease  may  have 
elevation of a serum tumor marker (e.g., β human chorionic gonad-
otropin  [β-hCG]  from  testicular  cancer).  Additional  testing  such 
as  cerebral  angiogram,  electroencephalogram  (EEG),  or  lumbar 
puncture is rarely indicated or helpful.

TREATMENT
Brain Tumors

Therapy of any intracranial malignancy requires both symptomatic 
and  definitive  treatments.  Definitive  treatment  is  based  on  the 
specific tumor type and includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemo-
therapy. However, symptomatic treatments apply to brain tumors of 
any type. Most high-grade malignancies are accompanied by sub-
stantial  surrounding  edema,  which  contributes  to  neurologic  dis-
ability and raised intracranial pressure. Glucocorticoids are highly 
effective at reducing perilesional edema and improving neurologic 
function, often within hours of administration. Dexamethasone has 
been the glucocorticoid of choice because of its relatively low min-
eralocorticoid activity; initial doses are 8–12 mg/d. Glucocorticoids 
rapidly  ameliorate  symptoms  and  signs,  but  their  long-term  use 
causes substantial toxicity including insomnia, weight gain, diabetes 
mellitus, steroid myopathy, and personality changes. Consequently, 
a taper is indicated as definitive treatment is administered and the 
patient improves.

Patients  with  brain  tumors  who  present  with  seizures  require 
antiepileptic drug therapy. Prophylactic antiepileptic drugs are used 
in the perioperative setting, but there is no role for extended use in 
patients who have not had a seizure. The agents of choice are those 
drugs that do not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme system. 
These include levetiracetam, topiramate, lamotrigine, valproic acid, 
and lacosamide (Chap. 425). Other drugs, such as phenytoin and 
carbamazepine,  are  used  less  frequently  because  they  are  potent 
enzyme  inducers  that  can  interfere  with  both  glucocorticoid  and 
chemotherapy metabolism. Venous thromboembolic disease occurs 
in 20–30% of patients with high-grade gliomas or brain metastases. 
Prophylactic anticoagulants should be used during hospitalization 
and in nonambulatory patients. Those who have had either a deep 
vein  thrombosis  or  a  pulmonary  embolus  can  receive  therapeutic 
doses of anticoagulation safely and without increasing the risk for 
hemorrhage into the tumor. Inferior vena cava filters are reserved 
for patients with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation such 
as recent craniotomy.

PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
No  etiology  has  been  identified  for  most  primary  brain  tumors.  The 
only established risk factors are exposure to ionizing radiation (men-
ingiomas, gliomas, and schwannomas) and immunosuppression (pri-
mary CNS lymphoma). There is no proven evidence for any association 
with exposure to electromagnetic fields including cellular telephones, 
head injury, foods containing N-nitroso compounds, or occupational 
risk factors. A small minority of patients have a family history of brain 
tumors. Some of these familial cases are associated with genetic syn-
dromes (Table 90-2).

 ■ MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS
As with other neoplasms, brain tumors arise as a result of a multistep 
process  driven  by  the  sequential  acquisition  of  genetic  alterations. 
These  include  loss  of  tumor-suppressor  genes  (e.g.,  p53,  cyclin- 
dependent kinase inhibitor 2A and 2B [CDKN2A/B], and phosphatase 
and  tensin  homolog  on  chromosome  10  [PTEN])  and  amplification 
and  overexpression  of  protooncogenes  such  as  the  epidermal  growth 
factor  receptor  (EGFR)  and  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptors 
(PDGFR). The accumulation of these genetic abnormalities results in 
uncontrolled  cell  growth  and  tumor  formation.  Many  brain  tumors, 
including  glioblastomas,  are  characterized  by  significant  molecular 
heterogeneity, which contributes to the difficulty in developing effec-
tive therapies.

Important progress has been made in understanding the molecular 
pathogenesis of several types of brain tumors, including glioblastoma 
and  medulloblastoma,  allowing  them  to  be  separated  into  different 
subtypes with different prognoses. This has led the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) to issue an update on the classification of CNS tumors 
in  2016  that  for  the  first  time  incorporates  molecular  parameters  in 
addition to traditional histology into the diagnosis of brain tumors.

INTRINSIC “MALIGNANT” TUMORS
 ■ DIFFUSE GLIOMAS
Gliomas are the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor 
and  are  derived,  based  on  their  presumed  lineage,  into  astrocytomas 
and  oligodendrogliomas.  These  tumors  are  classified  based  on  two 
highly recurrent molecular alterations, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 
mutations  and  1p/19q  codeletion,  in  addition  to  more  conventional 
histopathologic parameters. Most lower-grade astrocytomas have IDH 
mutations  but  intact  1p/19q  and  often  mutations  in  ATRX  and  p53. 
Oligodendrogliomas  usually  have  IDH  mutations  and  codeletion  of 
1p/19q. A minority of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas that lack 
IDH mutations (20–30%) have a worse prognosis.

Diffuse gliomas can present rarely as widespread infiltration of the 
brain  tissue  without  a  focal  mass.  Such  tumors  usually  present  with 
cognitive  problems,  and  the  MRI  demonstrates  confluent,  typically 
nonenhancing areas of increased signal on FLAIR sequences without 
significant  mass  effect.  Formerly  known  as  gliomatosis  cerebri,  these 
lesions are now categorized by the pathology identified on biopsy, but 
they can be diagnostically challenging when the nature of the imaging

abnormalities  is  unclear.  Often  diagnosis  is  delayed  until  the  patient 
develops worsening deficits or there is clear progression on imaging. 
Treatment is then determined by the pathology.

 ■ ASTROCYTOMAS
These  are  infiltrative  tumors  with  a  presumptive  glial  cell  of  origin. 
The WHO classifies astrocytomas into four prognostic grades based on 
histologic features: grade I (pilocytic astrocytoma, subependymal giant 
cell astrocytoma); grade II (astrocytoma); grade III (anaplastic astro-
cytoma); and grade IV (glioblastoma). Grades I and II are considered 
low-grade, and grades III and IV high-grade, astrocytomas.

Low-Grade Astrocytoma 
•  GRADE I ASTROCYTOMAS  Pilocytic 
astrocytomas  (WHO  grade  I)  are  the  most  common  tumor  of  child-
hood.  They  occur  typically  in  the  cerebellum  but  may  also  be  found 
elsewhere  in  the  neuraxis,  including  the  optic  nerves  and  brainstem. 
Frequently  they  appear  as  cystic  lesions  with  an  enhancing  mural 
nodule. Often they have BRAF fusions or mutations. These are well- 
demarcated lesions that are potentially curable if they can be resected 
completely. Giant cell subependymal astrocytomas are usually found in 
the ventricular wall of patients with tuberous sclerosis. They often do 
not require intervention but can be treated surgically or with inhibitors 
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).

GRADE II ASTROCYTOMAS  These are infiltrative tumors that usually 
present with seizures in young adults. They appear as nonenhancing 
tumors with increased T2/FLAIR signal (Fig. 90-1). If feasible, patients 
should undergo maximal surgical resection, although complete resec-
tion is rarely possible because of the invasive nature of the tumor. In 
patients at higher risk for recurrence (subtotal resection or above the 
age of 40 years), there is evidence that radiation therapy (RT) followed 
by  PCV  (procarbazine,  cyclohexylchloroethylnitrosourea  [CCNU], 
and vincristine) chemotherapy may possibly be of benefit. The tumor 

transforms  to  a  malignant  astrocytoma  in  most  patients,  leading  to 
variable survival with a median of ~5–10 years.

astrocytomas.  They  generally  present  in  the  fourth  and  fifth  decades 
of  life  as  variably  enhancing  tumors.  Treatment  is  the  same  as  for 
glioblastoma,  consisting  of  maximal  safe  surgical  resection  followed 
by RT and adjuvant temozolomide alone or RT with concurrent and 
adjuvant temozolomide.

GRADE  IV  ASTROCYTOMA  (GLIOBLASTOMA)  Glioblastoma  accounts 
for  the  majority  of  high-grade  astrocytomas.  Approximately  10%  of 
glioblastomas have IDH mutations. These tend to arise from lower-grade 
tumors  (secondary  glioblastomas)  and  have  a  better  prognosis.  In  the 
next  update  of  the  WHO  classification,  the  term  glioblastoma  will  be 
restricted  to  tumors  without  IDH  mutations.  Glioblastomas  with  IDH 
mutations  have  a  different  biology  and  better  prognosis  and  will  be 
termed astrocytomas,  IDH-mutant, grade 4. In addition, astrocytomas 
without the classic histologic features of glioblastoma (necrosis and endo-
thelial proliferation) but that have the molecular features of glioblastoma 
(epidermal  growth  factor  amplification,  combined  with  whole  chro-
mosome 7 gain and 10 loss, or telomerase reverse transcriptase [TERT] 
promoter mutations) will also be considered glioblastomas.

Glioblastomas  are  the  most  common  malignant  primary  brain 
tumor,  with  >12,000  cases  diagnosed  each  year  in  the  United  States. 
Patients usually present in the sixth and seventh decades of life with 
headache,  seizures,  or  focal  neurologic  deficits.  The  tumors  appear 
as  ring-enhancing  masses  with  central  necrosis  and  surrounding 
edema (Fig. 90-2). These are highly infiltrative tumors, and the areas 
of  increased  T2/FLAIR  signal  surrounding  the  main  tumor  mass 
contain  invading  tumor  cells.  Treatment  involves  maximal  surgical 
resection  followed  by  partial-field  external-beam  RT  (6000  cGy  in 
thirty  200-cGy  fractions)  with  concomitant  temozolomide,  followed 
by  6  months  of  adjuvant  temozolomide.  With  this  regimen,  median 
survival is increased to 14.6–18 months compared to only 12 months 
with  RT  alone,  and  5-year  survival  is  ~10%.  Efforts  to  increase  the 
dose  of  RT  locally  using  brachytherapy  or  stereotactic  radiosurgery 
(SRS)  have  failed  to  improve  the  outcome  and  these  treatments  are 
not  used.  Patients  whose  tumor  contains  the  DNA  repair  enzyme 
O6-methylguanine-DNA  methyltransferase  (MGMT)  are  relatively 
resistant  to  temozolomide  and  have  a  worse  prognosis  compared  to 
those whose tumors contain low levels of MGMT as a result of silenc-
ing of the MGMT gene by promoter hypermethylation. Implantation of 
biodegradable polymers containing carmustine chemotherapy into the 
tumor bed after resection of the tumor or addition of tumor treating 
fields (scalp electrodes delivering low-intensity electric currents) pro-
duces a modest improvement in survival.

For elderly patients aged >65–70 years, a hypofractionated RT reg-
imen of 40 Gy over 3 weeks with temozolomide is well tolerated and 
likely leads to similar outcomes as the 6-week standard RT regimen.

Despite optimal therapy, glioblastomas invariably recur. Treatment 
options  for  recurrent  disease  may  include  reoperation,  re-irradiation 
with  bevacizumab,  and  alternate  chemotherapeutic  regimens.  Bev-
acizumab,  a  humanized  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF) 
monoclonal antibody, has activity in recurrent glioblastoma, increasing 
progression-free survival but not overall survival and reducing peritu-
moral edema and glucocorticoid use (Fig. 90-3). Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors  have  been  successful  in  a  variety  of  solid  tumors  but  have 
failed  to  demonstrate  substantial  activity  in  glioblastoma.  A  recent 
phase  III  trial  comparing  bevacizumab  with  nivolumab  in  recurrent 
glioblastoma  demonstrated  an  identical  median  overall  survival  of  
9.8–10 months in the two arms, with similar toxicities. Treatment deci-
sions for patients with recurrent glioblastoma must be made on an indi-
vidual basis, taking into consideration such factors as previous therapy, 
time  to  relapse,  performance  status,  and  quality  of  life.  Whenever 
feasible, patients should be enrolled in clinical trials. Novel therapies

undergoing  evaluation  in  patients  with  glioblastoma  include  targeted 
molecular  agents  directed  at  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  and  signal 
transduction  pathways;  immunotherapy  using  vaccines,  novel  check-
point inhibitors, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells; oncolytic 
viruses; antiangiogenic agents; chemotherapeutic agents that cross the 
blood-brain barrier more effectively than currently available drugs; and 
infusion of radiolabeled drugs and targeted toxins into the tumor and 
surrounding brain by means of convection-enhanced delivery.

The  most  important  adverse  prognostic  factors  in  patients  with 
glioblastomas are older age, absence of IDH mutations, unmethylated 
MGMT promoter, poor Karnofsky performance status, and unresect-
able tumor.

Gliosarcomas are a variant of glioblastoma containing both an astro-
cytic and a sarcomatous component and are treated in the same way as 
glioblastomas.

 ■ OLIGODENDROGLIOMA
Oligodendrogliomas account for ~15–20% of gliomas. They are charac-
terized by codeletion of 1p/19q and have IDH mutations. Oligodendro-
gliomas are classified by the WHO into oligodendrogliomas (grade II) or 
anaplastic  oligodendrogliomas  (AOs)  (grade  III).  Oligodendrogliomas 
have distinctive pathologic features such as perinuclear clearing—giving 
rise to a “fried-egg” appearance—and a reticular pattern of blood vessel 
growth. Some tumors have both an oligodendroglial as well as an astro-
cytic component. With molecular testing, it is now clear that almost all 
of these mixed tumors (oligoastrocytomas) are genetically either astro-
cytomas or oligodendrogliomas. As a result, the diagnosis of oligoas-
trocytoma is now rarely made unless molecular testing is not available.
Grade II oligodendrogliomas are generally more responsive to ther-
apy  and  have  a  better  prognosis  than  pure  astrocytic  tumors.  These 
tumors present similarly to grade II astrocytomas in young adults. The 
tumors  are  nonenhancing  and  often  partially  calcified.  They  should 
be treated with surgery and, in patients with residual disease or aged  
>40  years,  RT  and  chemotherapy.  Patients  with  oligodendrogliomas 
have a median survival in excess of 10 years.

AOs present in the fourth and fifth decades as variably enhancing 
tumors. They are more responsive to therapy than grade III astrocyto-
mas.  Treatment  involves  maximal  safe  resection  followed  by  RT  and 
PCV or temozolomide chemotherapy. Median survival of patients with 
AO is in excess of 10 years.

 ■ EPENDYMOMAS
Ependymomas  are  tumors  derived  from  ependymal  cells  that  line 
the  ventricular  surface.  They  account  for  ~5%  of  childhood  tumors, 
frequently arise from the wall of the fourth ventricle in the posterior 
fossa,  are  associated  with  RELA  fusions,  and  are  classified  as  type  A 
and  B  ependymoma  subtypes.  Although  adults  can  have  intracranial 
ependymomas, they occur more commonly in the spine, especially in 
the filum terminale of the spinal cord where they have a myxopapillary 
histology.  Ependymomas  that  can  be  completely  resected  are  poten-
tially curable. Partially resected ependymomas will recur and require 
irradiation. The less common anaplastic ependymoma is more aggres-
sive  and  is  treated  with  resection  and  RT;  chemotherapy  has  limited 
efficacy. Subependymomas are slow-growing benign lesions arising in 
the wall of ventricles that often do not require treatment.

 ■ OTHER LESS COMMON GLIOMAS
Gangliogliomas and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas occur in young 
adults. They behave as more indolent forms of grade I gliomas and are 
usually  treated  with  surgery.  Frequently  they  will  have  BRAF  V600E 
mutations.  Brainstem  gliomas  usually  occur  in  children  or  young 
adults and often have H3K27M mutations. Despite treatment with RT 
and  chemotherapy,  the  prognosis  is  poor,  with  a  median  survival  of 
only 1 year.

 ■ PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 
LYMPHOMA
Primary  central  nervous  system  lymphoma  (PCNSL)  is  a  rare  non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma accounting for <3% of primary brain tumors. For 

FIGURE  90-4  Postgadolinium  T1  MRI  demonstrating  a  large  bifrontal  primary 
central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). The periventricular location and diffuse 
enhancement pattern are characteristic of lymphoma. 

unclear  reasons,  its  incidence  is  increasing,  particularly  in  immuno-
competent, older individuals.

PCNSL  in  immunocompetent  patients  is  usually  a  diffuse  large 
B-cell  lymphoma.  Immunocompromised  patients,  especially  those 
infected  with  the  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  or  organ 
transplant recipients, are at risk for PCNSL that is typically large cell 
with immunoblastic and more aggressive features. Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV)  plays  an  important  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  PCNSL  in  this 
population. These patients are usually severely immunocompromised, 
with CD4 counts of <50/mL.

Immunocompetent patients with PCNSL are older (median 60 years) 
than those with HIV-related PCNSL (median 31 years). PCNSL usually 
presents as a mass lesion, with neuropsychiatric symptoms, lateralizing 
signs, or seizures. Ocular and leptomeningeal involvement each occur 
in  15–20%  of  patients,  and  involvement  of  these  compartments  may 
be asymptomatic. Rarely, it may present as isolated ocular lymphoma 
or as primary leptomeningeal lymphoma. When restricted to the lep-
tomeninges,  it  may  present  as  a  subacute  or  chronic  meningitis  that 
causes progressive cranial and spinal nerve dysfunction. CSF cytologic 
examination or flow cytometry is required to establish the diagnosis.

On  contrast-enhanced  MRI,  PCNSL  usually  appears  as  a  densely 
enhancing tumor (Fig. 90-4). Immunocompetent patients have solitary 
lesions more often than immunosuppressed patients. Frequently there 
is involvement of the basal ganglia, corpus callosum, or periventricular 
region. Stereotactic biopsy is necessary to obtain a histologic diagnosis. 
Whenever possible, glucocorticoids should be withheld until after the 
biopsy has been obtained because they have a cytolytic effect on lym-
phoma cells and may lead to nondiagnostic tissue. In addition, patients 
should be tested for HIV, and the extent of disease should be assessed 
by performing PET or CT of the body, MRI of the spine, CSF analysis, 
and slit-lamp examination of the eye. Bone marrow biopsy and testic-
ular ultrasound are occasionally performed.

TREATMENT
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma

PCNSL is more sensitive to glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, and RT 
than other primary brain tumors. Durable complete responses and 
long-term  survival  are  possible  with  these  treatments.  High-dose 
methotrexate, a folate antagonist that interrupts DNA synthesis, pro-
duces response rates ranging from 35 to 80% and median survival

706

of  up  to  50  months.  The  combination  of  methotrexate  with  other 
chemotherapeutic agents such as cytarabine increases the response 
rate to 70–100%. The addition of whole-brain RT (WBRT) to metho-
trexate-based chemotherapy prolongs progression-free survival but 
not overall survival, but it is associated with delayed neurotoxicity, 
especially in patients aged >60 years. As a result, full-dose RT is fre-
quently omitted, but there may be a role for reduced-dose RT. The 
anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  rituximab  is  often  incorporated 
into  the  chemotherapy  regimen,  although  there  are  studies  ques-
tioning its benefit. For some patients, high-dose chemotherapy with 
autologous stem cell rescue may offer the best chance of preventing 
relapse.  At  least  50%  of  patients  will  eventually  develop  recurrent 
disease. Treatment options include RT for patients who have not had 
prior  irradiation,  retreatment  with  methotrexate,  as  well  as  other 
chemotherapeutic  agents  such  as  temozolomide  and  pemetrexed. 
High-dose  chemotherapy  with  autologous  stem  cell  rescue  may 
be  appropriate  in  selected  patients  with  relapsed  disease.  Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib, immunomodu-
latory drugs such as pomalidomide and lenalidomide, and immune 
checkpoint  inhibitors  have  shown  promising  preliminary  activity 
and are being evaluated in clinical trials, as are CAR T cells. 
PCNSL IN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS
PCNSL in immunocompromised patients often produces multiple 
ring-enhancing  lesions  that  can  be  difficult  to  differentiate  from 
metastases  or  infections  such  as  toxoplasmosis.  The  diagnosis  is 
usually  established  by  examination  of  the  CSF  for  cytology  and 
EBV  DNA;  toxoplasmosis  serologic  testing;  brain  PET  imaging 
for  hypermetabolism  of  the  lesions,  which,  although  nonspecific, 
can be consistent with tumor; and, if necessary, brain biopsy. Since 
the  advent  of  highly  active  antiretroviral  drugs,  the  incidence  of 
HIV-related  PCNSL  has  declined.  These  patients  are  preferably 
treated with high-dose methotrexate-based regimens and initiation 
of highly active antiretroviral therapy; WBRT is reserved for those 
who  cannot  tolerate  systemic  chemotherapy.  In  organ  transplant 
recipients, reduction of immunosuppression may improve outcome.

 ■ MEDULLOBLASTOMAS
Medulloblastomas  are  the  most  common  malignant  brain  tumor  of 
childhood,  accounting  for  ~20%  of  all  primary  CNS  tumors  among 
children. They arise from granule cell progenitors or from multipotent 
progenitors from the ventricular zone. Approximately 5% of children 
with  medulloblastoma  have  an  inherited  syndrome,  such  as  Gorlin, 
Turcot,  or  Li-Fraumeni,  which  predisposes  to  the  development  of 
medulloblastoma. Histologically, medulloblastomas are highly cellular 
tumors  with  abundant  dark  staining,  round  nuclei,  and  rosette  for-
mation  (Homer-Wright  rosettes).  In  the  2016  WHO  pathologic  clas-
sification, they have been divided into four molecular subgroups: (1) 
WNT-activated (primarily affects children and has the best outcome); 
(2)  SHH-activated  (affects  adults,  infants,  and  children,  with  the 
younger patients having the better outcome and adults doing poorly); 
(3)  non-WNT/non-SHH,  group  3  (frequently  has  disseminated  CNS 
disease at diagnosis and has the worst outcome); and (4) non-WNT/
non-SHH,  group  4  (30%  have  metastases  at  diagnosis,  but  5-year  
progression-free  survival  is  95%).  Regardless  of  subtype,  patients 
present with headache, ataxia, and signs of brainstem involvement. On 
MRI, they appear as densely enhancing tumors in the posterior fossa, 
sometimes  associated  with  hydrocephalus.  Treatment  involves  max-
imal  surgical  resection,  craniospinal  irradiation,  and  chemotherapy 
with agents such as cisplatin, lomustine, cyclophosphamide, and vin-
cristine. Approximately 70% of patients overall have long-term survival 
but  usually  at  the  cost  of  significant  neurocognitive  impairment.  A 
major goal of current research is to improve survival while minimizing 
long-term complications, and clinical trials are now being designed for 
specific molecular subgroups.
 ■ PINEAL REGION TUMORS
A large variety of tumors can arise in the region of the pineal gland. These 
typically present with headache, visual symptoms, and hydrocephalus. 

Patients  may  have  Parinaud’s  syndrome  characterized  by  impaired 
upgaze and accommodation. Some pineal tumors such as pineocytomas 
and benign teratomas can be treated by surgical resection. Germinomas 
respond to irradiation, whereas pineoblastomas and nongerminomatous 
germ cell tumors require craniospinal radiation and chemotherapy.

EXTRINSIC “BENIGN” TUMORS
 ■ MENINGIOMAS
Meningiomas are diagnosed with increasing frequency as more people 
undergo neuroimaging for various indications. They are now the most 
common primary brain tumor, accounting for ~35% of the total. Their 
incidence increases with age. They tend to be more common in women 
and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). They also occur 
more commonly in patients with a history of cranial irradiation.

Meningiomas  arise  from  the  dura  mater  and  are  composed  of 
neoplastic meningothelial (arachnoidal cap) cells. They are most com-
monly located over the cerebral convexities, especially adjacent to the 
sagittal sinus, but they can also occur in the skull base and along the 
dorsum  of  the  spinal  cord.  Meningiomas  are  classified  by  the  WHO 
into  three  histologic  grades  of  increasing  aggressiveness:  grade  I 
(benign), grade II (atypical), and grade III (malignant).

Many meningiomas are found incidentally following neuroimaging 
for unrelated reasons. They can also present with headaches, seizures, 
or  focal  neurologic  deficits.  On  imaging  studies,  they  have  a  charac-
teristic  appearance  usually  of  a  densely  enhancing  extra-axial  tumor 
arising from the dura (Fig. 90-5). Typically they have a dural tail, con-
sisting of thickened, enhanced dura extending like a tail from the mass. 
The main differential diagnosis of meningioma is a dural metastasis.

If  the  meningioma  is  small  and  asymptomatic,  no  intervention  is 
necessary  and  the  lesion  can  be  observed  with  serial  MRI  studies. 
Larger, symptomatic lesions should be resected. If complete resection 
is  achieved,  the  patient  is  cured.  Incompletely  resected  tumors  tend 
to recur, although the rate of recurrence can be very slow with grade 
I  tumors.  Tumors  that  cannot  be  resected,  or  can  only  be  partially 
removed,  may  benefit  from  external-beam  RT  or  SRS.  These  treat-
ments may also be helpful in patients whose tumor has recurred after 
surgery. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are currently unproven.
Rarer tumors that resemble meningiomas include hemangiopericy-
tomas and solitary fibrous tumors. Since they share similar molecular 
alterations (NAB2-STAT6 fusion), the 2016 WHO classification intro-
duced the combined term solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma 
for this entity. These tumors are treated with surgery and RT but have 
a higher propensity to recur locally or metastasize systemically.

Epidermoid  Cysts  These  consist  of  squamous  epithelium  sur-
rounding  a  keratin-filled  cyst.  They  are  usually  found  in  the  cere-
bellopontine  angle  and  the  intrasellar  and  suprasellar  regions.  They 
may present with headaches, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, or 
hydrocephalus. MRI demonstrates an extra-axial lesion with character-
istics that are similar to CSF but have restricted diffusion. Treatment 
involves surgical resection.

Dermoid  Cysts  Like  epidermoid  cysts,  dermoid  cysts  arise  from 
epithelial cells that are retained during closure of the neural tube. They 
contain  both  epidermal  and  dermal  structures  such  as  hair  follicles, 
sweat  glands,  and  sebaceous  glands.  Unlike  epidermoid  cysts,  these 
tumors  usually  have  a  midline  location.  They  occur  most  frequently 
in  the  posterior  fossa,  especially  the  vermis,  fourth  ventricle,  and 
suprasellar cistern. On MRI, dermoid cysts resemble lipomas, demon-
strating  T1  hyperintensity  and  variable  signal  on  T2.  Symptomatic 
dermoid cysts can be treated with surgery.

Colloid  Cysts  These  usually  arise  in  the  anterior  third  ventricle 
and  may  present  with  headaches,  hydrocephalus,  and,  very  rarely, 
sudden death. Surgical resection is curative, or a third ventriculostomy 
may relieve the obstructive hydrocephalus and be sufficient therapy.

NEUROCUTANEOUS SYNDROMES 
(PHAKOMATOSES)
A number of genetic disorders are characterized by cutaneous lesions 
and an increased risk of brain tumors. Most of these disorders have an 
autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance.
 ■ NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1  
(von RECKLINGHAUSEN’S DISEASE)
NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance and 
an incidence of ~1 in 2600–3000. Approximately one-half of cases are 
familial; the remainder are caused by new mutations arising in patients 
with  unaffected  parents.  The  NF1  gene  is  located  on  chromosome 
17q11.2  and  encodes  neurofibromin,  a  guanosine  triphosphatase 
(GTPase) activating protein (GAP) that is a negative regulator of the 
RAS–mitogen-activated  protein  (MAP)  kinase  signaling  pathway, 
which  includes  the  downstream  kinase  MEK.  It  is  a  classic  tumor 
suppressor, and biallelic loss can result in a variety of nervous system 
tumors  including  neurofibromas,  plexiform  neurofibromas,  optic 
nerve gliomas, astrocytomas, and meningiomas. In addition to neuro-
fibromas,  which  appear  as  multiple,  soft,  rubbery  cutaneous  tumors, 
other cutaneous manifestations of NF1 include café-au-lait spots and 
axillary freckling. NF1 is also associated with hamartomas of the iris 
termed  Lisch  nodules,  pheochromocytomas,  pseudoarthrosis  of  the 
tibia,  scoliosis,  epilepsy,  and  mental  retardation.  The  MEK  inhibitor 
selumetinib  has  activity  against  inoperable  plexiform  neurofibromas 
and  is  the  only  treatment  that  targets  the  dysregulated  signaling 
pathway.
 ■ NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 2
NF2  is  less  common  than  NF1,  with  an  incidence  of  1  in  25,000–
40,000. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with full penetrance. As 
with NF1, approximately one-half of cases arise from new mutations. 
The NF2 gene on 22q encodes a cytoskeletal protein, merlin (moesin, 
ezrin,  radixin-like  protein),  that  functions  as  a  tumor  suppressor. 
NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas in >90% of 
patients, multiple meningiomas, and spinal ependymomas and astro-
cytomas. Treatment of bilateral vestibular schwannomas can be chal-
lenging because the goal is to preserve hearing for as long as possible. 
These patients may also have diffuse schwannomatosis that may affect 
the  cranial,  spinal,  or  peripheral  nerves;  posterior  subcapsular  lens 
opacities; and retinal hamartomas.
 ■ TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS (BOURNEVILLE DISEASE)
This  is  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder  with  an  incidence  of  ~1  in 
5000–10,000 live births. It is caused by mutations in either the TSC1

can be seen to involve the internal auditory canal. 

 ■ SCHWANNOMAS
These  are  generally  benign  tumors  arising  from  the  Schwann  cells 
of  cranial  and  spinal  nerve  roots.  The  most  common  schwannomas, 
termed  vestibular  schwannomas  or  acoustic  neuromas,  arise  from  the 
vestibular  portion  of  the  eighth  cranial  nerve  and  account  for  ~9% 
of primary brain tumors. Patients with NF2 have a high incidence of 
vestibular  schwannomas  that  are  frequently  bilateral.  Schwannomas 
arising from other cranial nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve (cranial 
nerve V), occur with much lower frequency. Neurofibromatosis type 1 
(NF1) is associated with an increased incidence of schwannomas of the 
spinal nerve roots.

Vestibular  schwannomas  may  be  found  incidentally  on  neuroim-
aging  or  present  with  progressive  unilateral  hearing  loss,  dizziness, 
tinnitus,  or,  less  commonly,  symptoms  resulting  from  compression 
of  the  brainstem  and  cerebellum.  On  MRI,  they  appear  as  densely 
enhancing  lesions,  enlarging  the  internal  auditory  canal  and  often 
extending into the cerebellopontine angle (Fig. 90-6). The differential 
diagnosis includes meningioma. Very small, asymptomatic lesions can 
be  observed  with  serial  MRIs.  Larger  lesions  should  be  treated  with 
surgery or SRS. The optimal treatment will depend on the size of the 
tumor, symptoms, and the patient’s preference. In patients with small 
vestibular  schwannomas  and  relatively  intact  hearing,  early  surgical 
intervention increases the chance of preserving hearing.

 ■ PITUITARY TUMORS
These are discussed in detail in Chap. 380.

 ■ CRANIOPHARYNGIOMAS
Craniopharyngiomas are rare, usually suprasellar, partially calcified, solid, 
or mixed solid-cystic benign tumors that arise from remnants of Rathke’s 
pouch.  They  have  a  bimodal  distribution,  occurring  predominantly  in 
children but also between the ages of 55 and 65 years. They present with 
headaches,  visual  impairment,  and  impaired  growth  in  children  and 
hypopituitarism in adults. Treatment involves surgery, RT, or a combina-
tion of the two. The papillary subtype of craniopharyngiomas often has 
BRAF V600E mutations and can be treated with RAF/MEK inhibitors.

 ■ OTHER BENIGN TUMORS
Dysembryoplastic  Neuroepithelial  Tumors  (DNTs)  These 
are benign, supratentorial tumors, usually in the temporal lobe. They

gene, which maps to chromosome 9q34 and encodes a protein termed 
hamartin, or the TSC2 gene, which maps to chromosome 16p13.3 and 
encodes the protein tuberin. Hamartin forms a complex with tuberin, 
which inhibits cellular signaling through mTOR, and acts as a negative 
regulator of the cell cycle. Patients with tuberous sclerosis may have sei-
zures, mental retardation, adenoma sebaceum (facial angiofibromas), 
shagreen  patch,  hypomelanotic  macules,  periungual  fibromas,  renal 
angiomyolipomas,  and  cardiac  rhabdomyomas.  These  patients  have 
an increased incidence of subependymal nodules, cortical tubers, and 
subependymal  giant  cell  astrocytomas  (SEGAs).  Patients  frequently 
require anticonvulsants for seizures. SEGAs do not always require ther-
apeutic intervention, but the most effective therapy is with the mTOR 
inhibitors  sirolimus  or  everolimus,  which  often  decrease  seizures  as 
well as SEGA size.

TUMORS METASTATIC TO THE BRAIN
Brain metastases arise from hematogenous spread and frequently origi-
nate from a lung primary or are associated with pulmonary metastases. 
Most metastases develop at the gray matter–white matter junction in 
the  watershed  distribution  of  the  brain  where  intravascular  tumor 
cells lodge in terminal arterioles. The distribution of metastases in the 
brain approximates the proportion of blood flow such that ~85% of all 
metastases are supratentorial and 15% occur in the posterior fossa. The 
most common sources of brain metastases are lung and breast carcino-
mas; melanoma has the greatest propensity to metastasize to the brain, 
being found in 80% of patients at autopsy (Table 90-3). Other tumor 
types such as ovarian and esophageal carcinoma rarely metastasize to 
the brain. Prostate and breast cancers also have a propensity to metas-
tasize to the dura and can mimic meningioma. Leptomeningeal metas-
tases are common from hematologic malignancies and also breast and 
lung cancers. Spinal cord compression primarily arises in patients with 
prostate and breast cancer, tumors with a strong propensity to metas-
tasize to the axial skeleton.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS OF METASTASES
Brain metastases are best visualized on MRI, where they usually appear 
as well-circumscribed lesions (Fig. 90-7). The amount of perilesional 
edema can be highly variable, with large lesions causing minimal edema 
and sometimes very small lesions causing extensive edema. Enhance-
ment  may  be  in  a  ring  pattern  or  diffuse.  Occasionally,  intracranial 
metastases  will  hemorrhage;  melanoma,  thyroid,  and  kidney  cancer 
have  the  greatest  propensity  to  hemorrhage,  but  the  most  common 
cause of a hemorrhagic metastasis is lung cancer because it accounts for 
the majority of brain metastases. The radiographic appearance of brain 
metastasis is nonspecific, and similar-appearing lesions can occur with 
infection including brain abscesses, demyelinating lesions, sarcoidosis, 
radiation  necrosis  in  a  previously  treated  patient,  or  a  primary  brain 
tumor  that  may  be  a  second  malignancy  in  a  patient  with  systemic 
cancer. Biopsy is rarely necessary for diagnosis because imaging alone 
in the appropriate clinical situation usually suffices. However, in ~10%

if there is not an easily accessible systemic site to biopsy, a brain lesion 
must be removed for diagnostic purposes.

Tumors Metastatic to the Brain 

DEFINITIVE TREATMENT
The number and location of brain metastases often determine the 
therapeutic options. The patient’s overall condition and current or 
potential control of systemic disease are also major determinants. 
Brain  metastases  are  single  in  approximately  one-half  of  patients 
and multiple in the other half.

PART 4Oncology and Hematology 
RADIATION THERAPY
The  standard  treatment  for  brain  metastases  has  previously  been 
WBRT usually administered to a total dose of 3000 cGy in 10 frac-
tions. This affords rapid palliation, and ~80% of patients improve 
with glucocorticoids and RT. However, it is not curative, is associ-
ated with neurocognitive toxicity, and produces median survival of 
only 4–6 months. Recent data demonstrate that hippocampal avoid-
ance during WBRT preserves cognitive function without increasing 
the risk of an intracranial relapse. If feasible, SRS has become the 
primary radiation oncology approach to brain metastases. It can be 
delivered through a variety of equally effective techniques including 
the gamma knife, linear accelerator, proton beam, or CyberKnife, 
all  of  which  can  deliver  highly  focused  doses  of  RT,  usually  in  a 
single fraction. SRS can effectively sterilize the visible lesions and 
afford  local  disease  control  in  80–90%  of  patients.  Some  patients 
have been cured of their brain metastases using SRS, whereas this 
is distinctly rare with WBRT. Traditionally SRS was used only for 
patients with 1–3 metastases, but recent data suggest that SRS can 
effectively treat up to 10 lesions. It is, however, confined to lesions 
of ≤3 cm and is most effective in metastases of ≤1 cm. The addition 
of WBRT to SRS improves disease control in the nervous system but 
does not prolong survival and thus is rarely employed. 
SURGERY
Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that surgical extir-
pation of a single brain metastasis followed by WBRT is superior 
to  WBRT  alone.  Removal  of  two  lesions  or  a  single  symptomatic 
mass,  particularly  if  compressing  the  ventricular  system,  can  also 
be useful. This is particularly important in patients who have highly 
radioresistant  lesions  such  as  renal  carcinoma.  Surgical  resection 
can  produce  rapid  amelioration  of  symptoms,  improve  control  of 
edema, and result in prolonged survival. WBRT administered after 
complete  resection  of  a  brain  metastasis  improves  disease  control 
but  does  not  prolong  survival.  Some  centers  administer  focal  RT 
or even SRS to a resected cavity, especially if there is concern that 
tumor  has  been  left  behind,  but  most  avoid  postoperative  WBRT 
because of its cognitive effects. 
CHEMOTHERAPY
Chemotherapy is becoming increasingly useful for brain metasta-
ses.  Metastases  from  tumor  types  that  are  highly  chemosensitive, 
such  as  germ  cell  tumors  or  small-cell  lung  cancer,  may  respond 
to chemotherapeutic regimens chosen according to the underlying 
malignancy. Increasingly, data demonstrate responsiveness of brain 
metastases to chemotherapy including targeted therapeutics, such 
as  for  patients  with  lung  cancer  harboring  EGFR  mutations  that 
sensitize them to EGFR inhibitors. Immunotherapy is also effective 
against  those  primary  tumors  that  are  sensitive  to  this  approach, 
such  as  melanoma.  Antiangiogenic  agents  such  as  bevacizumab 
are effective in the treatment of CNS metastases in those primary 
tumors for which it is approved.

LEPTOMENINGEAL METASTASES
Leptomeningeal metastases are also described as carcinomatous men-
ingitis,  meningeal  carcinomatosis,  or,  in  the  case  of  specific  tumors, 
leukemic or lymphomatous meningitis. Among the hematologic malig-
nancies, acute leukemias most commonly metastasize to the subarach-
noid  space,  followed  in  frequency  by  aggressive  diffuse  lymphomas. 
Among solid tumors, breast and lung carcinomas and melanoma most 
frequently spread in this fashion. Tumor cells reach the subarachnoid 
space  via  the  arterial  circulation  or  occasionally  through  retrograde 
flow  in  venous  systems  that  drain  metastases  along  the  bony  spine 
or cranium. In addition, leptomeningeal metastases may develop as a 
direct consequence of prior brain metastases and occur in almost 40% 
of patients who have a metastasis resected from the cerebellum.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Leptomeningeal metastases are characterized by multilevel symptoms 
and  signs  along  the  neuraxis.  Combinations  of  lumbar  and  cervical 

radiculopathies, cranial neuropathies, seizures, confusion, and enceph-
alopathy  from  hydrocephalus  or  raised  intracranial  pressure  can  be 
present.  Focal  deficits  such  as  hemiparesis  or  aphasia  are  rarely  due 
to  leptomeningeal  metastases  unless  there  is  direct  brain  infiltration. 
New-onset  limb  pain  in  patients  with  breast  cancer,  lung  cancer,  or 
melanoma should prompt consideration of leptomeningeal spread.

709

 ■ LABORATORY AND IMAGING DIAGNOSIS
Leptomeningeal  metastases  are  particularly  challenging  to  diagnose 
because identification of tumor cells in the subarachnoid compartment 
may be elusive. MRI can be definitive when there are clear tumor nod-
ules  adherent  to  the  cauda  equina  or  spinal  cord,  enhancing  cranial 
nerves,  or  subarachnoid  enhancement  on  brain  imaging  (Fig.  90-8).

Imaging is diagnostic in ~75% of patients and is more often positive 
in  patients  with  solid  tumors.  Demonstration  of  tumor  cells  in  the 
CSF  is  definitive  and  often  considered  the  gold  standard.  However, 
CSF cytologic examination is positive in only 50% of patients on the 
first  lumbar  puncture  and  still  misses  10%  after  three  CSF  samples. 
New technologies, such as rare cell capture, enhance identification of 
tumor cells in the CSF; molecular profiling of the CSF can also identify 
tumor-specific mutations, indicating malignancy in the leptomeninges. 
CSF cytologic examination is most useful in hematologic malignancies, 
especially  when  combined  with  flow  cytometry  to  identify  a  clonal 
population.  Accompanying  CSF  abnormalities  include  an  elevated 
protein  concentration  and  an  elevated  white  blood  cell  count;  hypo-
glycorrhachia is noted in <25% of patients but is useful when present. 
Identification of tumor markers may be helpful in some solid tumors.

TREATMENT
Leptomeningeal Metastases

The  treatment  of  leptomeningeal  metastasis  is  palliative  because 
there  is  no  curative  therapy.  RT  to  the  symptomatically  involved 
areas,  such  as  skull  base  for  cranial  neuropathy,  can  relieve  pain 
and  sometimes  improve  function.  Craniospinal  irradiation  (CSI) 
is  avoided  because  it  has  significant  toxicity  with  myelosuppres-
sion and gastrointestinal irritation as well as limited effectiveness. 
However,  recent  data  on  proton  beam  CSI  suggest  better  disease 
control  with  fewer  systemic  toxicities.  Systemic  chemotherapy, 
targeted  therapeutics,  and  immunotherapy  have  all  demonstrated 
efficacy in the appropriate setting. Alternatively, intrathecal chemo-
therapy can be effective, particularly in hematologic malignancies. 
This  is  optimally  delivered  through  an  intraventricular  cannula 
(Ommaya  reservoir)  rather  than  by  lumbar  puncture.  Few  drugs 
can be delivered safely into the subarachnoid space, and they have 
a  limited  spectrum  of  antitumor  activity,  perhaps  accounting  for 
the relatively poor response to this approach, particularly in solid 
tumors. In addition, impaired CSF flow dynamics can compromise 
intrathecal  drug  delivery.  Surgery  has  a  limited  role  in  leptomen-
ingeal  metastasis.  A  ventriculoperitoneal  shunt  can  relieve  raised 
intracranial pressure; once placed, intrathecal drug cannot be used.

EPIDURAL METASTASIS
Epidural metastasis occurs in 3–5% of patients with a systemic malig-
nancy  and  causes  neurologic  compromise  by  compressing  the  spinal 
cord or cauda equina. The most common cancers that metastasize to 
the epidural space are those malignancies that spread to bone, such as 
breast and prostate. Lymphoma can cause bone involvement and com-
pression,  but  it  can  also  invade  an  intervertebral  foramen  and  cause 
spinal cord compression without bone destruction. The thoracic spine 
is affected most commonly, followed by the lumbar and then cervical 
spine.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Back pain is the presenting symptom of epidural metastasis in virtually 
all  patients;  the  pain  may  precede  neurologic  findings  by  weeks  or 
months.  The  pain  is  usually  exacerbated  by  lying  down;  by  contrast, 
arthritic  pain  is  often  relieved  by  recumbency.  Leg  weakness  is  seen 
in ~50% of patients, as is sensory dysfunction. Sphincter problems are 
present in ~25% of patients at diagnosis.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis  is  established  by  imaging,  preferably  with  an  MRI  of  the 
entire  spine  (Fig. 90-9).  Contrast  is  not  required  to  identify  bony  or 
epidural  lesions.  Any  patient  with  cancer  who  has  severe  back  pain 
should undergo an MRI. Plain films, bone scans, or even CT scans may 
show  bone  metastases,  but  only  MRI  can  reliably  delineate  epidural 
tumor. For patients unable to have an MRI, CT myelography should be 
performed to outline the epidural space. The differential diagnosis of 
epidural tumor includes epidural abscess, acute or chronic hematomas, 
epidural lipomatosis, and, rarely, extramedullary hematopoiesis.

around the thoracic spinal cord from esophageal cancer. 

TREATMENT
Epidural Metastasis

Epidural  metastasis  requires  immediate  treatment.  A  randomized 
controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of surgical resection 
followed by RT compared to RT alone. However, patients must be 
able  to  tolerate  surgery,  and  the  surgical  procedure  of  choice  is  a 
complete removal of the mass, which is typically anterior to the spi-
nal canal, necessitating an extensive approach and resection. Oth-
erwise, RT is the mainstay of treatment and can be used for patients 
with radiosensitive tumors, such as lymphoma, or for those unable 
to  undergo  surgery.  SRS  is  increasingly  being  used,  especially  for 
radioresistant  tumor  types  or  for  re-irradiation.  Chemotherapy  is 
rarely used for epidural metastasis unless the patient has minimal 
to  no  neurologic  deficit  and  a  highly  chemosensitive  tumor  such 
as lymphoma or germinoma. Patients generally fare well if treated 
before there is a severe neurologic deficit. Recovery from parapare-
sis is better after surgery than with RT alone, but survival is often 
short due to widespread metastatic tumor.

NEUROLOGIC TOXICITY OF THERAPY
 ■ TOXICITY FROM RADIOTHERAPY
RT  can  cause  a  variety  of  toxicities  in  the  CNS.  These  are  usually 
described based on their relationship in time to the administration of 
RT:  acute  (occurring  within  days  of  RT),  early  delayed  (months),  or 
late delayed (years). In general, the acute and early delayed syndromes 
resolve and do not result in persistent deficits, whereas the late delayed 
toxicities are usually permanent and sometimes progressive.

Acute Toxicity  Acute cerebral toxicity may occur during RT to the 
brain. RT can cause a transient disruption of the blood-brain barrier, 
resulting in edema and elevated intracranial pressure. This is usually 
manifest as headache, lethargy, nausea, and vomiting and can be both 
prevented  and  treated  with  the  administration  of  glucocorticoids. 
There is no acute RT toxicity that affects the spinal cord.

Early Delayed Toxicity  Early delayed toxicity is usually apparent 
weeks  to  months  after  completion  of  cranial  irradiation  and  is  likely 
due to focal demyelination. Clinically it may be asymptomatic or take 
the  form  of  worsening  or  reappearance  of  a  preexisting  neurologic 
deficit. At times, a contrast-enhancing lesion can be seen on MRI/CT

that can mimic the tumor for which the patient received the RT. For 
patients  with  a  malignant  glioma,  this  has  been  described  as  “pseu-
doprogression”  because  it  mimics  tumor  recurrence  on  MRI,  but  it 
represents  inflammation  and  necrotic  debris  engendered  by  effective 
therapy.  This  is  seen  with  increased  frequency  when  chemotherapy, 
particularly temozolomide, is given concurrently with RT. Pseudopro-
gression can resolve on its own or, if very symptomatic, may require 
glucocorticoids, resection, or bevacizumab.

In  the  spinal  cord,  early  delayed  RT  toxicity  is  manifest  as  a  
Lhermitte symptom with paresthesias of the limbs or along the spine 
when  the  patient  flexes  the  neck.  Although  frightening,  it  is  benign, 
resolves on its own, and does not portend more serious problems.

Late Delayed Toxicity  Late delayed toxicities are the most serious 
because they are often irreversible and cause severe neurologic deficits. 
In the brain, late toxicities can take several forms, the most common of 
which include radiation necrosis and leukoencephalopathy. Radiation 
necrosis  is  a  focal  mass  of  necrotic  tissue  that  is  contrast  enhancing 
on CT/MRI and may be associated with significant edema. This may 
appear identical to pseudoprogression but is seen months to years after 
RT  and  is  always  symptomatic.  Clinical  symptoms  and  signs  include 
seizures  and  findings  referable  to  the  location  of  the  necrotic  mass. 
The necrosis is caused by the effect of RT on cerebral vasculature with 
fibrinoid necrosis and occlusion of blood vessels. It can mimic tumor 
radiographically,  but  unlike  tumor,  it  is  typically  hypometabolic  on 
a  PET  scan  and  has  reduced  perfusion  on  perfusion  MR  sequences. 
It may require resection for diagnosis and treatment unless it can be 
managed with glucocorticoids. There are reports of improvement with 
hyperbaric oxygen or bevacizumab, but symptomatic benefit does not 
always accompany radiographic improvement.

Leukoencephalopathy  is  seen  most  commonly  after  WBRT  as 
opposed to focal RT. On T2 or FLAIR MR sequences, there is diffusely 
increased signal seen throughout the hemispheric white matter, often 
bilaterally  and  symmetrically.  There  tends  to  be  a  periventricular 
predominance  that  may  be  associated  with  atrophy  and  ventricular 
enlargement. Clinically, patients develop cognitive impairment, a gait 
disorder, and later urinary incontinence, all of which can progress over 
time. These symptoms mimic those of normal pressure hydrocephalus, 
and placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt can improve function in 
some  patients  but  does  not  reverse  the  deficits  completely.  Increased 
age is a risk factor for leukoencephalopathy but not for radiation necro-
sis. Necrosis appears to depend on an unidentified predisposition.

Other late neurologic toxicities include endocrine dysfunction if the 
pituitary or hypothalamus was included in the RT port. An RT-induced 
neoplasm can occur many years after therapeutic RT for either a prior 
CNS  or  a  head  and  neck  tumor;  accurate  diagnosis  requires  surgical 
resection or biopsy. In addition, RT causes accelerated atherosclerosis, 
which  can  cause  stroke  either  from  intracranial  vascular  disease  or 
carotid plaque from neck irradiation.

The peripheral nervous system is relatively resistant to RT toxicities. 
Peripheral  nerves  are  rarely  affected  by  RT,  but  the  plexus  is  more 
vulnerable. Plexopathy develops more commonly in the brachial than 
in the lumbosacral distribution. It must be differentiated from tumor 
progression  in  the  plexus,  which  is  usually  visualized  by  CT/MRI 
or  PET  scan  demonstrating  tumor  infiltrating  the  region.  Clinically, 
tumor progression is usually painful, whereas RT-induced plexopathy 
is  painless.  Radiation  plexopathy  is  also  more  commonly  associated 
with lymphedema and myokymia of the affected limb. Sensory loss and 
weakness are seen in both.

 ■ TOXICITY FROM CHEMOTHERAPY
Neurotoxicity is second to myelosuppression as the dose-limiting tox-
icity  of  chemotherapeutic  agents  (Table 90-4).  Chemotherapy  causes 
peripheral  neuropathy  from  many  commonly  used  agents,  and  the 
type of neuropathy can vary depending on the drug. Vincristine causes 
paresthesias  but  little  sensory  loss  and  is  associated  with  motor  dys-
function, autonomic impairment (frequently ileus), and, rarely, cranial 
nerve compromise. Cisplatin causes large-fiber sensory loss resulting 
in  sensory  ataxia  but  little  cutaneous  sensory  loss  and  no  weakness.

The  taxanes  also  cause  a  predominately  sensory  neuropathy.  Agents 
such as bortezomib and thalidomide also cause neuropathy. Sometimes 
a  severe  neuropathy  emerges  after  multiple  neurotoxic  agents  have 
been used together or in sequence.

Encephalopathy  and  seizures  are  common  toxicities  from  che-
motherapeutic  drugs.  Ifosfamide  can  cause  a  severe  encephalopathy, 
which  is  reversible  with  discontinuation  of  the  drug  and  the  use  of 
methylene blue for severely affected patients. Fludarabine also causes 
a severe global encephalopathy that may be permanent. Bevacizumab 
and other anti-VEGF agents can cause posterior reversible encephal-
opathy syndrome. Cisplatin can cause hearing loss and less frequently 
vestibular  dysfunction.  Immunotherapy  with  monoclonal  antibodies 
such as ipilimumab or nivolumab can cause an autoimmune hypoph-
ysitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or an autoimmune encephalitis.

91 Soft Tissue and Bone 
Sarcomas and Bone 
Metastases
Shreyaskumar R. Patel

Sarcomas  are  rare  (<1%  of  all  malignancies)  mesenchymal  neo-
plasms that arise in bone and soft tissues. These tumors are usually of 
mesodermal origin, although a few are derived from neuroectoderm, 
and  they  are  biologically  distinct  from  the  more  common  epithelial 
malignancies. Sarcomas affect all age groups; 15% are found in children 
<15 years of age, and 40% occur after age 55 years. Sarcomas are one 
of the most common solid tumors of childhood and are the fifth most 
common cause of cancer deaths in children. Sarcomas may be divided 
into two groups, those derived from bone and those derived from soft 
tissues.

SOFT TISSUE SARCOMAS
Soft tissues include muscles, tendons, fat, fibrous tissue, synovial tissue, 
vessels, and nerves. Approximately 60% of soft tissue sarcomas arise in 
the extremities, with the lower extremities involved three times as often 
as  the  upper  extremities.  Thirty  percent  arise  in  the  trunk,  with  the 
retroperitoneum accounting for 40% of all trunk lesions. The remain-
ing 10% arise in the head and neck.
 ■ INCIDENCE
Approximately  13,130  new  cases  of  soft  tissue  sarcomas  occurred  in 
the United States in 2020. The annual age-adjusted incidence is 3 per 

100,000 population, but the incidence varies with age. Soft tissue sarco-
mas constitute 0.7% of all cancers in the general population and 6.5% 
of all cancers in children.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Malignant  transformation  of  a  benign  soft  tissue  tumor  is  extremely 
rare, with the exception that malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
(neurofibrosarcoma,  malignant  schwannoma)  can  arise  from  neuro-
fibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis. Several etiologic factors 
have been implicated in soft tissue sarcomas.

Environmental  Factors  Trauma  or  previous  injury  is  rarely 
involved, but sarcomas can arise in scar tissue resulting from a prior 
operation, burn, fracture, or foreign body implantation. Chemical car-
cinogens such as polycyclic hydrocarbons, asbestos, and dioxin may be 
involved in the pathogenesis.

Iatrogenic  Factors  Sarcomas  in  bone  or  soft  tissues  occur  in 
patients  who  are  treated  with  radiation  therapy.  The  tumor  nearly 
always arises in the irradiated field. The risk increases with time.

Viruses  Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) in patients with HIV type 1, classic 
KS,  and  KS  in  HIV-negative  homosexual  men  is  caused  by  human 
herpesvirus (HHV) 8 (Chap. 195). No other sarcomas are associated 
with viruses.

Immunologic  Factors  Congenital  or  acquired  immunodefi-
ciency,  including  therapeutic  immunosuppression,  increases  the  risk 
of sarcoma.

 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Li-Fraumeni  syndrome  is  a  familial  cancer  syndrome  in  which 
affected  individuals  have  germline  abnormalities  of  the  tumor-
suppressor  gene  p53  and  an  increased  incidence  of  soft  tissue 
sarcomas  and  other  malignancies,  including  breast  cancer,  osteosar-
coma,  brain  tumor,  leukemia,  and  adrenal  carcinoma  (Chap.  71). 
Neurofibromatosis  1  (NF-1,  peripheral  form,  von  Recklinghausen’s 
disease)  is  characterized  by  multiple  neurofibromas  and  café-au-lait 
spots. Neurofibromas occasionally undergo malignant degeneration to 
become malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. The gene for NF1 
is  located  in  the  pericentromeric  region  of  chromosome  17  and 
encodes  neurofibromin,  a  tumor-suppressor  protein  with  guanosine 
5′-triphosphate (GTP)ase-activating activity that inhibits ras function 
(Chap. 90). Germline mutation of the RB1 locus (chromosome 13q14) 
in patients with inherited retinoblastoma is associated with the devel-
opment of osteosarcoma in those who survive the retinoblastoma and 
of soft tissue sarcomas unrelated to radiation therapy. Other soft tissue 
tumors, including desmoid tumors, lipomas, leiomyomas, neuroblasto-
mas, and paragangliomas, occasionally show a familial predisposition.
Ninety percent of synovial sarcomas contain a characteristic chro-
mosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) involving a nuclear transcrip-
tion factor on chromosome 18 called SYT and two breakpoints on X. 
Patients  with  translocations  to  the  second  X  breakpoint  (SSX2)  may 
have longer survival than those with translocations involving SSX1.

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) type II is produced by some sarco-
mas and may act as an autocrine growth factor and as a motility factor 
that  promotes  metastatic  spread.  IGF-II  stimulates  growth  through 
IGF-I receptors, but its effects on motility are through different recep-
tors. If secreted in large amounts, IGF-II may produce hypoglycemia 
(Chaps.  93  and  406).  A  large  international  sarcoma  kindred  study 
including  1162  patients  and  6545  Caucasian  controls  revealed  that 
about half the patients with sarcoma have putatively pathogenic mono-
genic and polygenic variation in previously reported and new cancer 
genes,  some  of  them  representing  therapeutically  actionable  targets. 
These patients were diagnosed with sarcoma at an earlier age compared 
to controls.

 ■ CLASSIFICATION
Approximately  20  different  groups  of  sarcomas  are  recognized  on 
the  basis  of  the  pattern  of  differentiation  toward  normal  tissue.  For 
example, rhabdomyosarcoma shows evidence of skeletal muscle fibers

with  cross-striations;  leiomyosarcomas  contain  interlacing  fascicles 
of spindle cells resembling smooth muscle; and liposarcomas contain 
adipocytes. When precise characterization of the group is not possible, 
the  tumors  are  called  unclassified  sarcomas.  All  of  the  primary  bone 
sarcomas  can  also  arise  from  soft  tissues  (e.g.,  extraskeletal  osteosa-
rcoma).  The  entity  malignant  fibrous  histiocytoma  (MFH)  includes 
many tumors previously classified as fibrosarcomas or as pleomorphic 
variants of other sarcomas and is characterized by a mixture of spindle 
(fibrous)  cells  and  round  (histiocytic)  cells  arranged  in  a  storiform 
pattern with frequent giant cells and areas of pleomorphism. As immu-
nohistochemical  suggestion  of  differentiation,  particularly  myogenic 
differentiation, may be found in a significant fraction of these patients, 
many are now characterized as poorly differentiated leiomyosarcomas, 
and the terms undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) and myxofi-
brosarcoma are replacing MFH and myxoid MFH.

For purposes of treatment, most soft tissue sarcomas can be consid-
ered  together.  However,  some  specific  tumors  have  distinct  features. 
For example, liposarcoma can have a spectrum of behaviors. Pleomor-
phic liposarcomas and dedifferentiated liposarcomas behave like other 
high-grade  sarcomas;  in  contrast,  well-differentiated  liposarcomas 
(better  termed  atypical  lipomatous  tumors)  lack  metastatic  potential, 
and myxoid liposarcomas metastasize infrequently, but, when they do, 
they  have  a  predilection  for  unusual  metastatic  sites  containing  fat, 
such  as  the  retroperitoneum,  mediastinum,  and  subcutaneous  tissue. 
Rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing’s sarcoma, and other small-cell sarcomas 
tend to be more aggressive and are more responsive to chemotherapy 
than other soft tissue sarcomas.

Gastrointestinal  stromal  tumors  (GISTs),  previously  classified  as 
gastrointestinal  leiomyosarcomas,  are  now  recognized  as  a  distinct 
entity  within  soft  tissue  sarcomas.  Its  cell  of  origin  resembles  the 
interstitial  cell  of  Cajal,  which  controls  peristalsis.  The  majority  of 
malignant GISTs have activating mutations of the c-kit gene that result 
in  ligand-independent  phosphorylation  and  activation  of  the  KIT 
receptor  tyrosine  kinase,  leading  to  tumorigenesis.  Approximately 
5–10% of tumors will have a mutation in the platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor α (PDGFRA). GISTs that are wild type for both KIT and 
PDGFRA mutations may show mutations in SDH B, C, or D and may 
be driven by the IGF-I pathway.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The most common presentation is an asymptomatic mass. Mechanical 
symptoms referable to pressure, traction, or entrapment of nerves or 
muscles  may  be  present.  All  new  and  persistent  or  growing  masses 
should  be  biopsied,  either  by  a  small  incision  or  by  a  cutting  needle 
(core-needle biopsy) placed so that it can be encompassed in the sub-
sequent excision without compromising a definitive resection. Lymph 
node metastases occur in 5%, except in synovial and epithelioid sarco-
mas,  clear-cell  sarcoma  (melanoma  of  the  soft  parts),  angiosarcoma, 
and rhabdomyosarcoma, where nodal spread may be seen in 17%. The 
pulmonary parenchyma is the most common site of metastases. Excep-
tions are GISTs, which metastasize to the liver; myxoid liposarcomas, 
which seek fatty tissue; and clear cell sarcomas, which may metastasize 
to bones. Central nervous system metastases are rare, except in alveolar 
soft part sarcoma.

Radiographic Evaluation 
Imaging of the primary tumor is best 
with  plain  radiographs  and  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  for 
tumors of the extremities or head and neck and by computed tomog-
raphy (CT) for tumors of the chest, abdomen, or retroperitoneal cavity. 
A radiograph and CT scan of the chest are important for the detection 
of lung metastases. Other imaging studies may be indicated, depending 
on the symptoms, signs, or histology.
 ■ STAGING AND PROGNOSIS
The histologic grade and size of the primary tumor are the most impor-
tant prognostic factors. The current American Joint Committee on Can-
cer (AJCC) staging system is shown in Table 91-1. Prognosis is related 
to the stage. Cure is common in the absence of metastatic disease, but a 
small number of patients with metastases can also be cured. Historically, 
most patients with stage IV disease used to die within 12 months, but

with availability of multiple lines of treatments, median survival in sec-
ond-line and beyond ranges from 13 to 14 months, and some patients 
may live with stable or slowly progressive disease for many years.

TREATMENT
Soft Tissue Sarcomas

AJCC  stage  I  patients  are  adequately  treated  with  surgery  alone. 
Stage II patients are considered for adjuvant radiation therapy. Stage 
III patients may benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemother-
apy. Stage IV patients are managed primarily with systemic therapy, 
with or without other modalities. 
SURGERY
Soft  tissue  sarcomas  tend  to  grow  along  fascial  planes,  with  the 
surrounding soft tissues compressed to form a pseudocapsule that 
gives  the  sarcoma  the  appearance  of  a  well-encapsulated  lesion. 
This is invariably deceptive because “shelling out,” or marginal exci-
sion, of such lesions results in a 50–90% probability of local recur-
rence.  Wide  excision  with  a  negative  margin,  incorporating  the 
biopsy site, is the standard surgical procedure for local disease. The 
adjuvant  use  of  radiation  therapy  and/or  chemotherapy  improves 
the local control rate and permits the use of limb-sparing surgery 
with a local control rate (85–90%) comparable to that achieved by 
radical  excisions  and  amputations.  Limb-sparing  approaches  are 
indicated except when negative margins are not obtainable, when 
the risks of radiation are prohibitive, or when neurovascular struc-
tures are involved so that resection will result in serious functional 
consequences to the limb. 
RADIATION THERAPY
External-beam  radiation  therapy  is  an  adjuvant  to  limb-sparing 
surgery  for  improved  local  control.  Preoperative  radiation  ther-
apy  allows  the  use  of  smaller  fields  and  smaller  doses  but  results 
in  a  higher  rate  of  wound  complications.  Postoperative  radiation 
therapy  must  be  given  to  larger  fields,  because  the  entire  surgical 
bed must be encompassed, and in higher doses to compensate for 
hypoxia  in  the  operated  field.  This  results  in  a  higher  rate  of  late 
complications.  Brachytherapy  or  interstitial  therapy,  in  which  the 
radiation  source  is  inserted  into  the  tumor  bed,  is  comparable  in 
efficacy  (except  in  low-grade  lesions),  less  time  consuming,  and 
less expensive.

With  the  advent  of  stereotactic  body  radiotherapy  (SBRT),  the 
role of radiation therapy in oligometastatic disease in various vis-
ceral sites is being investigated and evolving.

ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY
Chemotherapy  is  the  mainstay  of  treatment  for  Ewing’s  sarcomas/
primitive  neuroectodermal  tumors  (PNETs)  and  rhabdomyosar-
comas.  Meta-analysis  of  14  randomized  trials  in  non-small-cell 
sarcomas  revealed  a  significant  improvement  in  local  control  and 
disease-free  survival  in  favor  of  doxorubicin-based  chemotherapy. 
Overall  survival  improvement  was  4%  for  all  sites  and  7%  for  the 
extremity site. An updated meta-analysis including four additional 
trials  with  doxorubicin  and  ifosfamide  combination  reported  a 
statistically  significant  6%  survival  advantage  in  favor  of  chemo-
therapy.  A  chemotherapy  regimen  including  an  anthracycline  and 
ifosfamide with growth factor support improved overall survival by 
19% for high-risk (high-grade, ≥5 cm primary, or locally recurrent) 
extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Long-term follow-up of a trial eval-
uating neoadjuvant use of the same combination confirms survival 
advantage and reports a 10-year survival of 61%. A more contempo-
rary randomized trial compared the standard anthracycline and ifos-
famide combination to specific histology-tailored chemotherapy as 
an active control and confirmed superiority of the standard regimen. 
ADVANCED DISEASE
Metastatic soft tissue sarcomas are largely incurable, but up to 20% 
of  patients  who  achieve  a  complete  response  become  long-term 
survivors. The therapeutic intent, therefore, is to produce a complete 
remission  with  chemotherapy  (<10%)  and/or  surgery  (30–40%). 
Surgical  resection  of  metastases,  whenever  possible,  is  an  integral 
part of the management. Some patients benefit from repeated sur-
gical excision of metastases. The two most active chemotherapeutic 
agents  are  doxorubicin  and  ifosfamide.  These  drugs  show  a  steep 
dose-response relationship in sarcomas. Gemcitabine with or with-
out  docetaxel  has  become  an  established  second-line  regimen  and 
is  particularly  active  in  patients  with  UPS  and  leiomyosarcomas. 
Dacarbazine also has some modest activity. Taxanes have selective 
activity in angiosarcomas, and vincristine, etoposide, and irinotecan 
are  effective  in  rhabdomyosarcomas  and  Ewing’s  sarcomas.  Pazo-
panib, an inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor, plate-
let-derived  growth  factor  (PDGF),  and  c-kit,  is  now  approved  for 
patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas excluding liposarcomas 
after failure of chemotherapy. Two additional chemotherapy drugs 
have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Trabectedin was compared to dacarbazine in a large phase 3 
randomized study in advanced leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas 
after failure of an anthracycline and resulted in significant improve-
ment in progression-free survival. Eribulin was also tested in a sim-
ilar trial and showed improvement in survival, predominantly in the 
liposarcoma subgroup, and is therefore now approved for that subset. 
Tazemetostat, an EZH2 inhibitor, is now approved for use in meta-
static epithelioid sarcomas characterized by loss of tumor-suppressor 
gene  INI1,  resulting  in  activation  of  the  EZH2  pathway.  Imatinib 
targets KIT and PDGF tyrosine kinase activity and is standard ther-
apy for advanced/metastatic GISTs and dermatofibrosarcoma protu-
berans. Imatinib is also indicated as adjuvant therapy for completely 
resected primary GISTs. Three years of adjuvant imatinib appear to 
be  superior  to  1  year  of  therapy  for  high-risk  GISTs,  although  the 
optimal treatment duration remains unknown. Sunitinib and rego-
rafenib are approved for second- and third-line use, respectively, in 
metastatic GIST after failure of or intolerance to imatinib. Ripretinib, 
an inhibitor of c-kit and PDGFRA, was approved for fourth-line use 
in metastatic GIST based on a placebo-controlled randomized trial 
reporting an improved median progression-free and overall survival. 
Avapritinib also received approval for use in the specific molecular 
subset of PDGFRA D842V–mutant metastatic GIST.

BONE SARCOMAS
 ■ INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Bone sarcomas are rarer than soft tissue sarcomas; they accounted for 
only 0.2% of all new malignancies and 3600 new cases in the United 
States  in  2020.  Several  benign  bone  lesions  have  the  potential  for 

malignant  transformation.  Enchondromas  and  osteochondromas  can 
transform into chondrosarcoma; fibrous dysplasia, bone infarcts, and 
Paget’s disease of bone can transform into either UPS or osteosarcoma.

 ■ CLASSIFICATION
Benign  Tumors  The  common  benign  bone  tumors  include 
enchondroma, osteochondroma, chondroblastoma, and chondromyx-
oid fibroma, of cartilage origin; osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma, of 
bone origin; fibroma and desmoplastic fibroma, of fibrous tissue ori-
gin; hemangioma, of vascular origin; and giant cell tumor, of unknown 
origin.

Malignant Tumors  The most common malignant tumors of bone 
are plasma cell tumors (Chap. 111). The four most common malignant 
nonhematopoietic  bone  tumors  are  osteosarcoma,  chondrosarcoma, 
Ewing’s sarcoma, and UPS. Rare malignant tumors include chordoma 
(of  notochordal  origin),  malignant  giant  cell  tumor,  adamantinoma 
(of unknown origin), and hemangioendothelioma (of vascular origin).

Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Staging System  Sarcomas of 
bone are staged according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society stag-
ing system based on grade and compartmental localization. A Roman 
numeral reflects the tumor grade: stage I is low grade, stage II is high 
grade, and stage III includes tumors of any grade that have lymph node 
or distant metastases. In addition, the tumor is given a letter reflecting 
its  compartmental  localization.  Tumors  designated  A  are  intracom-
partmental (i.e., confined to the same soft tissue compartment as the 
initial tumor), and tumors designated B are extracompartmental (i.e., 
extending into the adjacent soft tissue compartment or into bone). The 
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system is shown in Table 91-2.

 ■ OSTEOSARCOMA
Osteosarcoma,  accounting  for  almost  45%  of  all  bone  sarcomas,  is  a 
spindle  cell  neoplasm  that  produces  osteoid  (unmineralized  bone)  or 
bone.  Approximately  60%  of  all  osteosarcomas  occur  in  children  and 
adolescents in the second decade of life, and ∼10% occur in the third 
decade of life. Osteosarcomas in the fifth and sixth decades of life are 
frequently secondary to either radiation therapy or transformation in a 
preexisting benign condition, such as Paget’s disease. Males are affected 
1.5–2  times  as  often  as  females.  Osteosarcoma  has  a  predilection  for 
metaphyses of long bones; the most common sites of involvement are 
the  distal  femur,  proximal  tibia,  and  proximal  humerus.  The  classi-
fication  of  osteosarcoma  is  complex,  but  75%  of  osteosarcomas  fall 
into the “classic” category, which includes osteoblastic, chondroblastic, 
and  fibroblastic  osteosarcomas.  The  remaining  25%  are  classified  as 
“variants”  on  the  basis  of  (1)  clinical  characteristics,  as  in  the  case  of 
osteosarcoma of the jaw, postradiation osteosarcoma, or Paget’s osteosa-
rcoma; (2) morphologic characteristics, as in the case of telangiectatic 
osteosarcoma,  small-cell  osteosarcoma,  or  epithelioid  osteosarcoma; 
or  (3)  location,  as  in  parosteal  or  periosteal  osteosarcoma.  Diagnosis 
usually requires a synthesis of clinical, radiologic, and pathologic fea-
tures. Patients typically present with pain and swelling of the affected 
area. A plain radiograph reveals a destructive lesion with a moth-eaten 
appearance, a spiculated periosteal reaction (sunburst appearance), and 
a cuff of periosteal new bone formation at the margin of the soft tissue 
mass (Codman’s triangle). A CT scan of the primary tumor is best for 
defining  bone  destruction  and  the  pattern  of  calcification,  whereas 
MRI  is  better  for  defining  intramedullary  and  soft  tissue  extension. 
A  chest  radiograph  and  CT  scan  are  used  to  detect  lung  metastases. 
Metastases  to  the  bony  skeleton  should  be  imaged  by  a  bone  scan  or 
by  fluorodeoxyglucose  positron  emission  tomography  (FDG-PET). 
Almost all osteosarcomas are hypervascular and PET-avid. Pathologic 
diagnosis is established either with a core-needle biopsy, where feasible, 
or with an open biopsy with an appropriately placed incision that does 
not compromise future limb-sparing resection. Most osteosarcomas are 
high grade. The most important predictive factor for long-term survival 
is  response  to  chemotherapy.  Preoperative  chemotherapy  followed  by 
limb-sparing surgery (which can be accomplished in >80% of patients) 
followed by postoperative chemotherapy is standard management. The 
effective  drugs  are  doxorubicin,  ifosfamide,  cisplatin,  and  high-dose 
methotrexate with leucovorin rescue. The various combinations of these 
agents that have been used have all been about equally successful. Long-
term  survival  rates  in  extremity  osteosarcoma  range  from  60  to  80%. 
Osteosarcoma is radioresistant; radiation therapy has no role in the rou-
tine management. UPS is considered a part of the spectrum of osteosar-
coma and is managed similarly. A randomized trial has shown improved 
progression-free survival with regorafenib compared to placebo.

 ■ CHONDROSARCOMA
Chondrosarcoma, which constitutes ~20–25% of all bone sarcomas, is 
a tumor of adulthood and old age with a peak incidence in the fourth 
to sixth decades of life. It has a predilection for the flat bones, especially 
the shoulder and pelvic girdles, but can also affect the diaphyseal por-
tions of long bones. Chondrosarcomas can arise de novo or as a malig-
nant transformation of an enchondroma or, rarely, of the cartilaginous 
cap of an osteochondroma. Chondrosarcomas have an indolent natural 
history and typically present as pain and swelling. Radiographically, the 
lesion may have a lobular appearance with mottled or punctate or annu-
lar calcification of the cartilaginous matrix. It is difficult to distinguish 
low-grade chondrosarcoma from benign lesions by x-ray or histologic 
examination. The diagnosis is therefore influenced by clinical history 
and physical examination. A new onset of pain, signs of inflammation, 
and progressive increase in the size of the mass suggest malignancy. The 
histologic classification is complex, but most tumors fall within the clas-
sic  category.  Like  other  bone  sarcomas,  high-grade  chondrosarcomas 
spread to the lungs. Most chondrosarcomas are resistant to chemother-
apy, and surgical resection of primary or recurrent tumors, including 
pulmonary metastases, is the mainstay of therapy with the exception of 
two histologic variants. Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma has a high-
grade  osteosarcoma  or  a  malignant  fibrous  histiocytoma  component 

that responds to chemotherapy. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, a rare 
variant composed of a small-cell element, also is responsive to systemic 
chemotherapy and is treated like Ewing’s sarcoma.

715

 ■ EWING’S SARCOMA
Ewing’s sarcoma, which constitutes ~10–15% of all bone sarcomas, is 
common in adolescence and has a peak incidence in the second decade 
of life. It typically involves the diaphyseal region of long bones and also 
has an affinity for flat bones. The plain radiograph may show a charac-
teristic “onion peel” periosteal reaction with a generous soft tissue mass, 
which is better demonstrated by CT or MRI. This mass is composed of 
sheets of monotonous, small, round, blue cells and can be confused with 
lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and small-cell carcinoma. 
The presence of p30/32, the product of the mic-2 gene (which maps to 
the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes), is a cell-
surface marker for Ewing’s sarcoma (and other members of the Ewing 
family of tumors, previously also called PNETs). Most PNETs arise in 
soft  tissues;  they  include  peripheral  neuroepithelioma,  Askin’s  tumor 
(chest  wall),  and  esthesioneuroblastoma.  Glycogen-filled  cytoplasm 
detected  by  staining  with  periodic  acid–Schiff  is  also  characteristic 
of  Ewing’s  sarcoma  cells.  The  classic  cytogenetic  abnormality  asso-
ciated with this disease is a reciprocal translocation of the long arms 
of  chromosomes  11  and  22,  t(11;22),  which  creates  a  chimeric  gene 
product  of  unknown  function  with  components  from  the  fli-1  gene 
on chromosome 11 and ews on chromosome 22. This disease is very 
aggressive, and it is therefore considered a systemic disease. Common 
sites  of  metastases  are  lung,  bones,  and  bone  marrow.  Systemic  che-
motherapy is the mainstay of therapy, often being used before surgery. 
Doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, etoposide, vincristine, 
and dactinomycin are active drugs. Topotecan or irinotecan in combi-
nation with an alkylating agent is often used in relapsed patients. Local 
treatment  for  the  primary  tumor  includes  surgical  resection,  usually 
with limb salvage or radiation therapy. Patients with lesions below the 
elbow and below the mid-calf have a 5-year survival rate of 80% with 
effective  treatment.  Ewing’s  sarcoma  at  first  presentation  is  a  curable 
tumor, even in the presence of obvious metastatic disease, especially in 
children <11 years old.

TUMORS METASTATIC TO BONE
Bone  is  a  common  site  of  metastasis  for  carcinomas  of  the  prostate, 
breast,  lung,  kidney,  bladder,  and  thyroid  and  for  lymphomas  and 
sarcomas. Prostate, breast, and lung primaries account for 80% of all 
bone  metastases.  Metastatic  tumors  of  bone  are  more  common  than 
primary bone tumors. Tumors usually spread to bone hematogenously, 
but local invasion from soft tissue masses also occurs. In descending 
order  of  frequency,  the  sites  most  often  involved  are  the  vertebrae, 
proximal  femur,  pelvis,  ribs,  sternum,  proximal  humerus,  and  skull. 
Bone metastases may be asymptomatic or may produce pain, swelling, 
nerve  root  or  spinal  cord  compression,  pathologic  fracture,  or  mye-
lophthisis  (replacement  of  the  marrow).  Symptoms  of  hypercalcemia 
may be noted in cases of bony destruction.

Pain  is  the  most  frequent  symptom.  It  usually  develops  gradually 
over  weeks,  is  usually  localized,  and  often  is  more  severe  at  night. 
When patients with back pain develop neurologic signs or symptoms, 
emergency evaluation for spinal cord compression is indicated (Chap. 
75). Bone metastases exert a major adverse effect on quality of life in 
cancer patients.

Cancer in the bone may produce osteolysis, osteogenesis, or both. 
Osteolytic lesions result when the tumor produces substances that can 
directly elicit bone resorption (vitamin D–like steroids, prostaglandins, 
or parathyroid hormone–related peptide) or cytokines that can induce 
the  formation  of  osteoclasts  (interleukin  1  and  tumor  necrosis  fac-
tor).  Osteoblastic  lesions  result  when  the  tumor  produces  cytokines 
that  activate  osteoblasts.  In  general,  purely  osteolytic  lesions  are  best 
detected  by  plain  radiography,  but  they  may  not  be  apparent  until 
they  are  >1  cm.  These  lesions  are  more  commonly  associated  with 
hypercalcemia  and  with  the  excretion  of  hydroxyproline-containing 
peptides  indicative  of  matrix  destruction.  When  osteoblastic  activity 
is  prominent,  the  lesions  may  be  readily  detected  using  radionuclide

bone  scanning  (which  is  sensitive  to  new  bone  formation),  and  the 
radiographic appearance may show increased bone density or sclerosis. 
Osteoblastic lesions are associated with higher serum levels of alkaline 
phosphatase  and,  if  extensive,  may  produce  hypocalcemia.  Although 
some tumors may produce mainly osteolytic lesions (e.g., kidney can-
cer) and others mainly osteoblastic lesions (e.g., prostate cancer), most 
metastatic  lesions  produce  both  types  of  lesion  and  may  go  through 
stages where one or the other predominates.

In  older  patients,  particularly  women,  it  may  be  necessary  to  dis-
tinguish  metastatic  disease  of  the  spine  from  osteoporosis.  In  oste-
oporosis,  the  cortical  bone  may  be  preserved,  whereas  cortical  bone 
destruction is usually noted with metastatic cancer.

TREATMENT
Metastatic Bone Disease

Treatment  of  metastatic  bone  disease  depends  on  the  underlying 
malignancy and the symptoms. Some metastatic bone tumors are 
curable  (lymphoma,  Hodgkin’s  disease),  and  others  are  treated 
with palliative intent. Pain may be relieved by local radiation ther-
apy.  Hormonally  responsive  tumors  are  responsive  to  hormone 
inhibition  (antiandrogens  for  prostate  cancer,  antiestrogens  for 
breast  cancer).  Strontium-89,  samarium-153,  and  radium-223  are 
bone-seeking  radionuclides  that  can  exert  antitumor  effects  and 
relieve symptoms. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds 
to  RANK  ligand,  inhibits  osteoclastic  activity  and  increases  bone 
mineral density. Bisphosphonates such as pamidronate may relieve 
pain and inhibit bone resorption, thereby maintaining bone min-
eral density and reducing risk of fractures in patients with osteo-
lytic metastases from breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Careful 
monitoring of serum electrolytes and creatinine is recommended. 
Monthly  administration  prevents  bone-related  clinical  events  and 
may reduce the incidence of bone metastases in women with breast 
cancer. When the integrity of a weight-bearing bone is threatened 
by  an  expanding  metastatic  lesion  that  is  refractory  to  radiation 
therapy, prophylactic internal fixation is indicated. Overall survival 
is related to the prognosis of the underlying tumor. Bone pain at the 
end of life is particularly common; an adequate pain relief regimen 
including sufficient amounts of narcotic analgesics is required. The 
management of hypercalcemia is discussed in Chap. 410.

92 Carcinoma of Unknown 

Primary
Kanwal Raghav, James L. Abbruzzese,  
Gauri R. Varadhachary

Carcinoma (or cancer) of unknown primary (CUP) is a biopsy-proven 
malignancy for which the anatomic site of origin remains unidentified 
after a standardized detailed diagnostic evaluation. CUP is one of the 
10 most frequently diagnosed cancers globally, accounting for 3–5% of 
all malignancies. Most investigators limit CUP to epithelial or undif-
ferentiated  cancers  and  do  not  include  lymphomas,  metastatic  mela-
nomas,  and  metastatic  sarcomas  because  these  cancers  have  specific 
histology and stage-based management guidelines, even in the absence 
of a primary site. CUP can occur in patients of all age groups including 
adolescents and young adults.

The  emergence  of  sophisticated  imaging,  robust  immunohis-
tochemistry (IHC), and genomic and proteomic tools has challenged 
the  “unknown”  designation.  Additionally,  effective  targeted  therapies 
in several cancers and tissue agnostic biomarker-driven therapies have 
endorsed  a  change  in  paradigm  from  empiricism  to  a  personalized 
approach to CUP management. The reasons cancers present as CUP 
remain  unclear.  One  hypothesis  is  that  the  primary  tumor  either 
regresses  after  seeding  the  metastasis  or  remains  so  small  that  it  is 
not detected. It is possible that CUP falls on the continuum of cancer 
presentation where the primary has been contained or eliminated by 
the  natural  body  defenses,  including  the  immune  system.  Alterna-
tively,  CUP  may  represent  a  specific  malignant  event  that  results  in 
an  increase  in  metastatic  spread  or  survival  relative  to  the  primary. 
Whether  the  CUP  metastases  truly  define  a  clone  that  is  genetically 
and phenotypically unique to this diagnosis remains to be determined.
Since  liver  is  a  common  site  of  CUP  presentation,  intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma  (ICC)  can  be  often  misdiagnosed  as  CUP.  Of 
note,  the  incidence  of  ICC  is  increasing,  whereas  at  the  same  time, 
that  of  CUP  is  declining.  Improvements  in  diagnostic  technologies 
including next-generation sequencing and other molecular techniques 
and  awareness  among  clinicians  to  differentiate  the  two  are  possibly 
contributing to an increased recognition and incidence of ICC.

CUP BIOLOGY
Studies  looking  for  unique  signature  abnormalities  in  CUP  tumors 
have not been positive. Abnormalities in chromosomes 1 and 12 and 
other  complex  cytogenetic  abnormalities  have  been  reported.  Ane-
uploidy  has  been  described  in  70%  of  CUP  patients  with  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma  or  undifferentiated  carcinoma.  The  overexpression 
of various genes, including RAS, BCL2 (40%), HER2 (11%), and P53 
(26–53%), has been identified in CUP samples, but they are found in 
many other malignancies and have no effect on response to therapy or 
survival. The extent of angiogenesis in CUP relative to that in metas-
tases from known primaries has also been evaluated, but no consistent 
findings  have  emerged.  Although  current  comprehensive  genomic 
profiling efforts may help identify targeted therapeutic approaches to 
improve outcomes for this disease as discussed below, they have failed 
thus far to reveal a distinct molecular signature. More comprehensive 
and  integrated  multiomic  efforts  are  needed  to  provide  insights  into 
CUP biology through recognition of molecular aberrations that espe-
cially drive metastatic growth.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Carcinoma (or Cancer) of Unknown Primary 

Initial CUP evaluation has two goals: search for the primary tumor 
based on pathologic evaluation of the metastases and determine the 
extent of disease. Focused evaluation directed by clinicopathologic 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   716

PART 4Oncology and Hematologycues  allows  for  judicious  and  efficient  use  of  diagnostic  tests. 
Obtaining a thorough medical history from CUP patients is essen-
tial,  including  paying  particular  attention  to  previous  surgeries, 
removed  lesions,  and  family  medical  history  to  assess  potential 
hereditary cancers. Adequate physical examination, including a dig-
ital rectal examination in men and breast and pelvic examinations 
in  women,  should  be  performed  based  on  clinical  presentation. 
Finally,  all  patients  with  CUP,  in  the  absence  of  contraindication, 
must undergo a computed tomographic (CT) scan of chest, abdo-
men and pelvis as a part of their standard work-up.

 ■ ROLE OF SERUM TUMOR MARKERS AND 
CYTOGENETICS
Most  tumor  markers,  including  carcinoembryonic  antigen  (CEA), 
CA-125, CA 19-9, and CA 15-3, when elevated, are nonspecific and not 
helpful in determining the primary site. Men who present with adeno-
carcinoma and predominant osteoblastic metastasis should undergo a 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. In patients with undifferentiated 
or poorly differentiated carcinoma (especially with a midline tumor), 
elevated β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and α fetoprotein 
(AFP) levels suggest the possibility of an extragonadal germ cell (testic-
ular) tumor. With the availability of advanced immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), cytogenetic studies are rarely needed.

 ■ ROLE OF IMAGING STUDIES
In the absence of contraindications, a baseline IV contrast computed 
tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is the stan-
dard of care. This helps to search for the primary tumor, evaluate the 
extent of disease, and select the most accessible biopsy site. With precise 
imaging and reporting, latent primary cancers, defined as appearance 
of a new primary cancer after a latent period of several months to years, 
is  uncommon  and  seen  in  ≤5%  of  CUP  patients,  usually  in  patients 
with  very  indolent  presentations  and/or  highly  responsive  metastatic 
cancers that allows a latent primary to emerge (grow) over time.

Mammography should be performed in all women who present with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma, specifically in those with isolated axillary 
lymphadenopathy.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  of  the  breast 
can be considered in patients with axillary adenopathy and suspected 
occult primary breast carcinoma following a negative mammography 
and ultrasound. The results of these imaging modalities can influence 
surgical  management;  a  negative  MRI  of  the  breast  predicts  a  low 
tumor yield at mastectomy.

A conventional workup for a squamous cell carcinoma and cervical 
CUP (neck lymphadenopathy with no known primary tumor) includes 
a CT scan or MRI and invasive studies, including indirect and direct 
laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and upper endoscopy. Ipsilateral (or bilat-
eral) staging tonsillectomy has been recommended for these patients. 
18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) 
scans  are  useful  in  this  patient  population  and  may  help  guide  the 
biopsy;  determine  the  extent  of  disease;  facilitate  the  appropriate 
treatment,  including  planning  radiation  fields;  and  help  with  disease 
surveillance.  A  smaller  radiation  field  encompassing  the  metastatic 
adenopathy  decreases  the  risk  of  chronic  xerostomia.  Several  studies 
have  evaluated  the  utility  of  PET  in  patients  with  squamous  cervical 
CUP, and head and neck primary tumors were identified in ~21–30%.
The diagnostic contribution of PET to the evaluation of other CUP 
presentations  (outside  of  the  neck  adenopathy  indication)  remains 
controversial  and  is  not  routinely  recommended.  PET-CT  can  be 
helpful for patients with bone metastases and those deemed candidates 
for aggressive multimodality therapy (surgical intervention/radiation) 
such as patients with solitary metastatic disease because the identifi-
cation of disease in addition to the solitary metastatic site may affect 
treatment planning.

Invasive  studies,  including  upper  endoscopy,  colonoscopy,  and 
bronchoscopy, should be limited to symptomatic patients or those with 
laboratory, imaging, or pathologic abnormalities that suggest that these 
techniques will result in a high yield in finding a primary cancer.

 ■ ROLE OF PATHOLOGIC STUDIES
A  detailed  pathologic  examination  of  the  most  accessible  biopsied 
tissue specimen is mandatory in CUP patients. Pathologic evaluation 
typically consists of hematoxylin and eosin stains and IHC tests. The 
importance of adequate tissue acquisition cannot be overemphasized in 
CUP. In addition to pathologic evaluation, tissue is also needed for tests 
of biomarkers of targeted agents, immunotherapy, and clinical trials.

717

Light  Microscopy  Evaluation  Adequate  tissue  obtained  pref-
erably  by  excisional  biopsy  or  core  needle  biopsy  (instead  of  only  a 
fine-needle aspiration) is stained with hematoxylin and eosin and sub-
jected to light microscopic examination. On light microscopy, 60–65% 
of CUP is adenocarcinoma, and 5% is squamous cell carcinoma. The 
remaining  30–35%  is  poorly  differentiated  adenocarcinoma,  poorly 
differentiated  carcinoma,  or  poorly  differentiated  neoplasm.  A  small 
percentage of lesions are diagnosed as neuroendocrine cancers (2%), 
mixed tumors (adenosquamous or sarcomatoid carcinomas), or undif-
ferentiated neoplasms (Table 92-1).

Role of IHC Analysis 
IHC stains are peroxidase-labeled antibod-
ies against specific tumor antigens that are used to define tumor lin-
eage. The number of available IHC stains is ever-increasing. However, 
a tiered and uniform approach to tissue evaluation in the CUP setting 
is lacking. For CUP cases, more is not necessarily better, and IHC stains 
should be used in conjunction with the patient’s clinical presentation 
and imaging studies to select the best therapy. Communication between 
the clinician and pathologist is essential. No stain is 100% sensitive or 
specific,  and  under-/overinterpretation  should  be  avoided.  Poor  dif-
ferentiation,  even  in  known  primary  tumors,  decreases  sensitivity  of 
hallmark IHC markers. PSA and thyroglobulin tissue markers, which 
are positive in prostate and thyroid cancer, respectively, are the most 
specific  of  the  current  marker  panel.  However,  these  cancers  rarely 
present  as  CUP,  so  the  yield  of  these  tests  may  be  low.  Figure  92-1  
delineates  a  simple  algorithm  for  immunohistochemical  staining  in 
CUP cases. Table 92-2 lists additional tests that may be useful to fur-
ther define the tumor lineage. A more comprehensive algorithm may 
improve  the  diagnostic  accuracy  but  can  make  the  process  complex 
and increase cost. With the use of IHC markers, electron microscopic 
analysis, which is time-consuming and expensive, is rarely needed.

There are >20 subtypes of cytokeratin (CK) intermediate filaments 
with different molecular weights and differential expression in various 
cell types and cancers. Monoclonal antibodies to specific CK subtypes 
have been used to help classify tumors according to their site of ori-
gin; commonly used CK stains in adenocarcinoma CUP are CK7 and 
CK20. CK7 is found in tumors of the lung, ovary, endometrium, breast, 
and  upper  gastrointestinal  tract  including  pancreaticobiliary  cancers, 
whereas CK20 is normally expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium, 
urothelium, and Merkel cells. The nuclear CDX-2 transcription factor, 
which  is  the  product  of  a  homeobox  gene  necessary  for  intestinal 
organogenesis, is often used to aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal 
adenocarcinomas. However, CDX-2 positivity can be seen with enteric 
or mucinous differentiation in tumors from diverse primary sites (e.g., 
mucinous ovarian cancers).

Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) nuclear staining is frequently 
positive  in  lung  and  thyroid  cancers.  Approximately  68%  of  adeno-
carcinomas and 25% of squamous cell lung cancers stain positive for 
TTF-1, which helps differentiate a lung primary tumor from metastatic

Gross cystic disease fibrous protein-15 (GCDFP-15), a 15-kDa mono-
mer protein, is a marker of apocrine differentiation that is detected in 
62–72%  of  breast  carcinomas.  GATA3  is  being  increasingly  used  in 
the CUP setting when there is concern for a breast primary and can be 
particularly  useful  as  a  marker  for  metastatic  breast  carcinoma,  espe-
cially  triple-negative  and  metaplastic  carcinomas,  which  lack  specific 
endocrine markers of mammary origin. UROIII, high-molecular-weight 
cytokeratin, thrombomodulin, and CK20 are the markers used to diag-
nose lesions of urothelial origin.

aPatterns emerging from coexpression of stains are better than individual stains to 
suggest putative primary site. Even with optimization, no IHC panel is 100% sensitive 
or specific (e.g., ovarian mucinous carcinoma can exhibit positivity with intestinal 
markers).

IHC performs the best when used in groups that give rise to patterns 
that are strongly indicative of certain profiles. For example, the TTF-1/
CK7+  and  CK20+/CDX-2+/CK7−  phenotypes  have  been  reported 
as  very  suggestive  of  lung  and  lower  gastrointestinal  cancer  profiles, 
respectively.  Despite  their  practical  utility,  these  patterns  have  not 
been validated prospectively in CUP patients. IHC is not without its 
limitations; several factors affect tissue antigenicity (antigen retrieval, 
specimen  processing,  and  fixation),  interpretation  of  stains  in  tumor 
(nuclear,  cytoplasmic,  membrane)  versus  normal  tissue,  inter-  and 
intraobserver variability, variable performance of different antibodies 
said to recognize the same antigen, and tissue heterogeneity and inade-
quacy (given small biopsy sizes). Communication with the pathologist 
is  critical  to  determine  if  additional  tissue  will  be  beneficial  in  the 
pathologic evaluation. Pathologic features should not always supersede 
clinical or radiologic findings when considering testing for biomark-
ers  of  therapeutic  response  (e.g.,  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor 
[EGFR],  ALK  mutations,  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 
[HER-2]).

Role of Cancer Classifier Molecular Profiling 
In the absence 
of a known primary, developing therapeutic strategies for CUP is chal-
lenging. The current diagnostic yield with imaging and immunochem-
istry is ~20–30% for CUP patients. To reduce diagnostic uncertainty, 
sophisticated molecular analytics have been applied to CUP samples. 
These  include  gene  expression  profiling,  messenger  RNA  (mRNA), 
microRNA, and epigenetic profiling to classify the CUP cancer.

Gene expression profiles are most commonly generated using quan-
titative  reverse  transcriptase  polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR)  or 
DNA microarray. Neural network programs are then used to develop 
predictive  algorithms  from  the  gene  expression  profiles.  Typically,  a 
training set of gene profiles from known cancers (preferably from met-
astatic sites) is used to train the software. Comprehensive gene expres-
sion databases that have become available for common malignancies 
are then applied to CUP samples, and the program can then be used to 
predict the putative origin of a CUP sample.

mRNA- or microRNA-based tissue of origin cancer classifier assays 
have  also  been  studied  in  prospective  and  retrospective  CUP  trials. 
More recently, a classifier based on microarray DNA methylation sig-
natures  has  been  studied  and  validated  in  known  cancers.  The  DNA 
methylation  profiling  predicted  a  primary  cancer  in  87%  of  the  216 
CUP patients.

Despite the sophistication of the cancer classifier molecular assays, 
most of the CUP studies have evaluated assay performance, although 
the  challenge  with  validating  the  accuracy  of  an  assay  for  CUP  is 
that,  by  definition,  the  primary  cancer  diagnosis  cannot  be  verified. 
Thus, current estimates of tissue of origin test accuracy have relied on 
indirect  metrics,  including  comparison  with  pathology/IHC,  clinical 
presentation,  appearance  of  latent  primaries,  and  autopsies.  Using 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   718

21/01/22   3:50 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologythese measures, the assays suggest a plausible primary in ~70–80% of 
patients studied. Three outcomes-based studies have been performed. 
First,  a  single-arm  study  reported  a  median  survival  of  12.5  months 
for patients who received assay-directed site-specific therapy. Second, 
a phase 2 trial of site-specific therapy, including molecularly targeted 
therapy, based on predicted tumor site from an algorithm using gene 
expression  and  alteration  profile  showed  a  1-year  survival  of  53.1%. 
However,  a  randomized  clinical  trial  evaluating  site-specific  therapy 
directed  by  gene  expression  profiling  versus  empirical  chemotherapy 
with  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  failed  to  show  a  significant  improve-
ment  in  1-year  survival  (44%  vs  55%,  p  =  .264)  with  this  approach. 
Firm  conclusions  of  therapeutic  impact  cannot  be  drawn  from  these 
studies  given  the  sample  size,  design,  statistical  biases,  confounding 
variables  including  use  of  subsequent  lines  of  (empiric)  therapy,  and 
heterogeneity  of  the  CUP  cancers.  Additional  studies  are  needed  to 
better understand the clinical impact of tissue of origin profiling tools 
and how these assays complement IHC and help guide therapy.

Role  of  Next-Generation  Sequencing  A  significant  push  is 
being  made  toward  personalized  medicine  across  all  cancer  types 
with  the  goal  of  identifying  driver  mutation(s)  in  a  patient  who  can 
be  treated  with  targeted  agents  independent  of  the  site  of  origin.  A 
retrospective study of 200 CUP tumor specimens reported on genomic 
alterations  using  the  hybrid  capture–based  FoundationOne  assay. 
The  authors  reported  that  a  large  number  of  CUP  samples  (85%) 
harbored  at  least  one  clinically  relevant  genomic  alteration  with  the 
potential  to  influence  and  personalize  therapy.  The  mean  number 
of  genomic  alterations  was  4.2  per  tumor,  and  the  most  common 
genetic  alterations  included  TP53  (55%),  KRAS  (20%),  CDKN2A 
(19%),  and  ARID1A  (11%).  The  adenocarcinoma  CUP  tumors  were 
more frequently driven by genetic alterations in the receptor tyrosine 
kinase (RTK)/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling 
pathway than nonadenocarcinoma CUP tumors. Although, druggable 
genetic lesions seen in CUP are comparable to those in defined large 
entities, whether molecularly stratified approaches for CUP will suc-
cessfully improve outcomes remains to be seen and clinical trials are 
needed. In a single-arm phase 2 study of 97 patients with molecularly 

719

targeted  therapy,  five  patients  were  found  to  have  targetable  EGFR 
mutations. Of these, four patients were treated with afatinib, an anti-
EGFR drug, and two patients achieved a progression-free survival of 
>6 months. The emerging role of assays looking for circulating tumor 
cells, so-called liquid biopsies, within known tumor types has stirred 
interest in their potential utility in CUP.

Ongoing histology and cellular-context agnostic prospective clinical 
trials are studying the presence of actionable mutations and matching 
patients to the right targeted drug. Should this approach eventually be 
appropriately validated, CUP would be a natural fit for genomic altera-
tion (GA)-based targeted therapy independent of tumor site. Immune 
checkpoint  inhibitors  (pembrolizumab)  for  microsatellite  instability 
high  (MSI-H)  or  deficient  mismatch  repair  (dMMR)  tumors  and 
NTRK  inhibitors  for  NTRK  fusion–positive  tumors  can  help  a  small 
minority of CUP patients.

TREATMENT
Carcinoma (or Cancer) of Unknown Primary 

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
The  treatment  of  CUP  continues  to  evolve,  albeit  slowly.  The 
median  survival  of  most  patients  with  disseminated  CUP  is   
~6–10  months.  Systemic  chemotherapy  is  the  primary  treatment 
modality in most patients with disseminated disease, but the care-
ful  integration  of  surgery,  radiation  therapy,  and  even  periods  of 
observation is important in the overall management of this condi-
tion (Figs. 92-2 and 92-3). Prognostic factors include performance 
status,  site  and  number  of  metastases,  response  to  chemotherapy, 
and  serum  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  levels.  Culine  and  col-
leagues  developed  a  prognostic  model  using  performance  status 
and  serum  LDH  levels,  which  allowed  the  assignment  of  patients 
into  two  subgroups  with  divergent  outcomes.  Raghav  and  col-
leagues  developed  a  prognostic  nomogram  to  provide  individu-
alized survival estimates for patients with CUP based on baseline 
gender, ECOG performance status, histology, number of metastatic

sites  and    neutrophil-lymphocyte  ratio.  Future  prospective  trials 
using  this  prognostic  model  are  warranted.  Clinically,  some  CUP 
diagnoses fall into a favorable prognostic subset. Others, including 
those with disseminated CUP, have a more unfavorable prognosis. 

TREATMENT OF FAVORABLE CUP SUBSETS 
Women with Isolated Axillary Adenopathy  Women with isolated 
axillary adenopathy with adenocarcinoma or carcinoma are usually 
treated for stage II or III breast cancer based on pathologic findings. 
These patients should undergo a breast MRI if mammogram and 
ultrasound are negative. Radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast 
is indicated if the MRI of the breast is positive. Chemotherapy and/
or  hormonal  therapy  are  indicated  based  on  patient’s  age  (pre-
menopausal or postmenopausal), nodal disease bulk, and hormone 
receptor  and  HER2  status  (Chap.  79).  It  is  important  to  verify 
that  the  pathology  suggests  a  breast  cancer  profile  (morphology, 
IHC  breast  markers  including  estrogen  receptor,  mammaglobin, 
GCDFP-15, GATA3, HER-2 gene expression) before embarking on 
a breast cancer therapeutic program. 

Women with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis  The term primary peri-
toneal  papillary  serous  carcinoma  (PPSC)  has  been  used  to 
describe CUP with carcinomatosis with the pathologic and labo-
ratory (elevated CA-125 antigen) characteristics of ovarian cancer 
but no ovarian primary tumor identified on transvaginal sonogra-
phy or laparotomy. Studies suggest that ovarian cancer and PPSC, 
which are both of müllerian origin, have similar gene expression 
profiles.  Similar  to  patients  with  ovarian  cancer,  patients  with 
PPSC are candidates for cytoreductive surgery, followed by adju-
vant  taxane-  and  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  In  one  retro-
spective study of 258 women with peritoneal carcinomatosis who 
had undergone cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy, 22% of 
patients  had  a  complete  response  to  chemotherapy;  the  median 
survival  duration  was  18  months  (range  11–24  months).  How-
ever, not all peritoneal carcinomatosis in women is PPSC. Careful 
pathologic  evaluation  can  help  diagnose  a  colon  cancer  profile 
(CDX-2+, CK20+, CK7−) or a pancreaticobiliary cancer or even 
a mislabeled peritoneal mesothelioma (calretinin, D2-40 positive; 
BerEp4, MOC-31 negative). 

Poorly  Differentiated  Carcinoma  with  Midline  Adenopathy   
(Chap. 88)  Men with poorly differentiated or undifferentiated car-
cinoma who present with midline adenopathy should be evaluated 
for  extragonadal  germ  cell  malignancy.  If  diagnosed  and  treated 
as such, they often experience a good response to treatment with  
platinum-based  combination  chemotherapy.  Response  rates  of 
>50%  have  been  noted,  and  long-term  survival  rates  of  10–15% 
have been reported. Older patients, especially smokers, who present 
with mediastinal adenopathy are more likely to have a lung or head 
and neck cancer profile. 

Neuroendocrine  Cancer  (Chap.  84)  Low-grade  neuroendocrine 
tumor (NET) often has an indolent course, and treatment decisions 
are based on symptoms and tumor bulk. Urine 5-HIAA and serum 
chromogranin  may  be  elevated  and  can  be  followed  as  markers. 
Often the patient is treated with somatostatin analogues alone for 
hormone-related  symptoms  (diarrhea,  flushing,  nausea).  Specific 
local therapies or systemic therapy would only be indicated if the 
patient  is  symptomatic  with  local  pain  secondary  to  significant 
growth  of  the  metastasis  or  the  hormone-related  symptoms  are 
not controlled with endocrine therapy. Novel therapy options have 
demonstrated  benefit  in  patients  with  low-grade  NET,  including 
sunitinib  (which  targets  the  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
pathway),  everolimus  (which  inhibits  the  mammalian  target  of 
rapamycin),  and  lutetium-177  dotatate  (a  somatostatin  peptide 
receptor  radioligand).  Patients  with  high-grade  NET  are  treated 
with  platinum-based  doublet  therapy;  20–25%  show  a  complete 
response, and up to 10% patients with limited/oligo presentations 
survive for >5 years. Some degree of neuroendocrine differentiation 
can be seen in diverse poorly differentiated carcinomas. 

Squamous  Cell  Carcinoma  Presenting  as  Neck  Adenopathy   
Patients  with  early-stage  squamous  cell  carcinoma  involving  the 
cervical lymph nodes are candidates for node dissection and radi-
ation therapy, which can result in long-term survival. The role of 
chemotherapy  in  these  patients  is  undefined,  although  chemora-
diation  therapy  or  induction  chemotherapy  is  often  used  and  is 
beneficial in bulky N2/N3 lymph node disease. 

Solitary  Metastatic  Sites  Patients  with  solitary  metastases  can 
also experience good treatment outcomes. Some patients who pres-
ent  with  locoregional  disease  are  candidates  for  aggressive  trimo-
dality (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) management—both 
prolonged disease-free survival and, occasionally, cure are possible. 

Men  with  Blastic  Skeletal  Metastases  and  Elevated  PSA   
(Chap. 87)  Blastic bone-only metastasis is a rare presentation, and 
elevated serum PSA or tumor staining with PSA may provide con-
firmatory evidence of prostate cancer in these patients. Those with 
elevated  levels  are  candidates  for  hormonal  or  other  therapy  for 
prostate cancer, although it is important to rule out other primary 
tumors (lung most common). 

MANAGEMENT OF DISSEMINATED CUP
Patients  who  present  with  liver,  brain,  and  adrenal  metastatic 
disease  usually  have  a  poor  prognosis.  Patients  with  peritoneal 
carcinomatosis  secondary  to  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  have  a 
broad differential diagnosis, which includes mainly gastrointestinal 
cancers  including  gastric,  appendiceal,  colon,  and  pancreaticobil-
iary cancers.

Traditionally,  platinum-based  combination  chemotherapy  regi-
mens have been used to treat CUP. Several broadly used regimens 
have been studied in the past two decades; these include paclitaxel-
carboplatin,  gemcitabine-cisplatin,  gemcitabine-oxaliplatin,  and 
irinotecan  and  fluoropyrimidine-based  therapies.  These  chemo-
therapeutic agents used as empiric regimens have shown response 
rates  of  25–40%,  and  their  use  obtains  median  survival  times  of 
6–13 months.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyOutside  of  favorable  subsets,  there  is  a  small  group  of  patients 
with a “definitive” IHC profile. These patients usually have a single 
diagnosis  based  on  their  clinicopathologic  presentation  and  are 
often treated for the putative primary tumor. This does not guar-
antee a response, although it increases the probability of response 
when  select  drugs  are  chosen  from  a  class  of  drugs  known  to  be 
effective in that cancer type. Efforts should be made to search for 
biomarkers of response to tumor-agnostic effective therapies such 
as  immunotherapy  for  MSI-H/dMMR  tumors.  Patients  who  do 
not  fall  into  those  categories  are  candidates  for  broad-spectrum 
platinum-based regimens, clinical trials, and additional trial-based 
genomic and proteomic tests. Today, we do not have many effective 
drugs for several CUP cancer profiles, and treatments overlap for 
some cancers. Immunotherapy has been an area of active interest 
due to robust and durable responses in cancers with known prima-
ries and has shown some activity in CUP. However, biomarkers of 
response and immune-sensitive subsets need to be defined within 
CUP.

SUMMARY
Patients with CUP should undergo a directed diagnostic search for the 
primary tumor on the basis of clinical and pathologic data. Subsets of 
patients  have  prognostically  favorable  disease,  as  defined  by  clinical 
or  histologic  criteria,  and  may  substantially  benefit  from  aggressive 
treatment; in these patients, prolonged survival can be expected. How-
ever, for most patients who present with advanced CUP, the prognosis 
remains poor with early resistance to available cytotoxic therapy. The 
current focus has shifted away from empirical chemotherapeutic trials 
to understanding the metastatic phenotype, tissue of origin profiling in 
select patients, and next-generation sequencing to identify actionable 
mutations in CUP patients. As novel therapies evolve in cancers with 
known primaries, investigations to assess their value in CUP will likely 
have an impact on management of CUP patients.

93 Paraneoplastic  
Syndromes:  
Endocrinologic/Hematologic
J. Larry Jameson, Dan L. Longo

Neoplastic cells can produce a variety of substances that can alter the 
physiology  of  hormonal,  hematologic,  dermatologic,  rheumatologic, 
renal,  and  neurologic  systems.  Paraneoplastic  syndromes  refer  to  the 
disorders  that  accompany  benign  or  malignant  tumors  but  are  not 
directly related to mass effects or invasion. Tumors of neuroendocrine 
origin,  such  as  small-cell  lung  carcinoma  (SCLC)  and  carcinoids  are 
common  causes  of  paraneoplastic  syndromes,  but  they  have  been 
associated with many types of tumors that produce peptide hormones, 
cytokines, and growth factors and induce the production of antibod-
ies.  Studies  of  the  prevalence  of  paraneoplastic  syndromes  indicate 
that they are more common than is generally appreciated. The signs, 
symptoms,  and  metabolic  alterations  associated  with  paraneoplastic 
disorders are easily overlooked in the context of a malignancy and its 
treatment.  Consequently,  atypical  clinical  manifestations  in  a  patient 
with  cancer  should  prompt  consideration  of  a  paraneoplastic  syn-
drome.  The  most  common  hormonal  and  hematologic  syndromes 
associated with underlying neoplasia will be discussed here.

ENDOCRINE PARANEOPLASTIC 
SYNDROMES
Etiology  Hormones  can  be  produced  from  eutopic  or  ectopic 
sources. Eutopic refers to the expression of a hormone from its normal 
tissue  of  origin,  whereas  ectopic  refers  to  hormone  production  from 
an  atypical  tissue  source.  For  example,  adrenocorticotropic  hormone 
(ACTH)  is  expressed  eutopically  by  the  corticotrope  cells  of  the 
anterior pituitary, but it can be expressed ectopically in SCLC. Many 
hormones are produced at low levels from tissues other than the clas-
sic endocrine source. Thus, ectopic expression is often a quantitative 
change rather than an absolute change in tissue expression. Neverthe-
less, the term ectopic expression is firmly entrenched and conveys the 
abnormal physiology associated with hormone production by neoplas-
tic cells. In addition to high levels of hormones, ectopic expression is 
often  characterized  by  abnormal  regulation  of  hormone  production 
(e.g.,  defective  feedback  control  in  ectopic  ACTH)  and  peptide  pro-
cessing  (resulting  in  large,  unprocessed  precursor  peptide  such  as 
proopiomelanocortin [POMC]).

Many  different  molecular  mechanisms  can  cause  ectopic  hor-
mone  production.  In  rare  instances,  genetic  rearrangements  account 
for  aberrant  hormone  expression.  For  example,  translocation  of  the 
parathyroid  hormone  (PTH)  gene  can  result  in  high  levels  of  PTH 
expression  in  tissues  other  than  the  parathyroid  gland  because  the 
genetic rearrangement brings the PTH gene under the control of atyp-
ical  regulatory  elements.  A  related  phenomenon  is  well  documented 
in many forms of leukemia and lymphoma, in which somatic genetic 
rearrangements confer a growth advantage and alter cellular differen-
tiation and function. Although genetic rearrangements cause selected 
cases of ectopic hormone production, this mechanism is rare, as many 
tumors are associated with excessive production of numerous peptides. 
Cellular dedifferentiation probably underlies most cases of ectopic hor-
mone production. Many cancers are poorly differentiated, and certain 
tumor products, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), PTH–
related protein (PTHrP), and α fetoprotein, are characteristic of gene 
expression at earlier developmental stages. In contrast, the propensity 
of certain cancers to produce particular hormones (e.g., squamous cell 
carcinomas produce PTHrP) suggests that dedifferentiation is partial 
or  that  selective  pathways  are  derepressed.  These  expression  profiles 
probably  reflect  epigenetic  modifications  that  alter  transcriptional

repression,  microRNA  expression,  and  other  pathways  that  govern  
cell differentiation.

In  SCLC,  the  pathway  of  differentiation  has  been  relatively  well 
defined.  The  neuroendocrine  phenotype  is  dictated  in  part  by  the 
basic-helix-loop-helix  (bHLH)  transcription  factor  human  achaete-
scute  homologue  1  (hASH1),  which  is  expressed  at  abnormally  high 
levels in SCLC associated with ectopic ACTH. The abnormal expres-
sion of hASH1 and other developmental transcription factors appears 
to provide a link between cell proliferation and differentiation.

Ectopic  hormone  production  might  be  considered  merely  epiphe-
nomenon  associated  with  cancer  if  it  did  not  cause  clinical  manifes-
tations.  Excessive  and  unregulated  production  of  hormones  such  as 
ACTH, PTHrP, and vasopressin can lead to substantial morbidity and 
complicate  the  cancer  treatment  plan.  Moreover,  the  paraneoplastic 
endocrinopathies  may  be  a  presenting  clinical  feature  of  underlying 
malignancy and prompt the search for an unrecognized tumor.

A large number of paraneoplastic endocrine syndromes have been 
described, linking overproduction of particular hormones with specific 
types of tumors. However, certain recurring syndromes emerge from 
this group (Table 93-1). The most common paraneoplastic endocrine 
syndromes include hypercalcemia from overproduction of PTHrP and 
other  factors,  hyponatremia  from  excess  vasopressin,  and  Cushing’s 
syndrome from ectopic ACTH.

 ■ HYPERCALCEMIA CAUSED BY ECTOPIC 
PRODUCTION OF PTHRP
(See also Chap. 410)

Etiology  Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) occurs in 
up to 20% of patients with cancer. HHM is most common in cancers 
of the lung, head and neck, skin, esophagus, breast, and genitourinary 
tract and in multiple myeloma and lymphomas, as well as metastases 
associated  with  these,  and  other  cancers.  There  are  several  distinct 
humoral causes of HHM, but it is caused most commonly by overpro-
duction of PTHrP. In addition to acting as a circulating humoral factor, 
bone metastases (e.g., breast, multiple myeloma) may produce PTHrP 
and other chemokines, leading to local osteolysis and hypercalcemia. 
PTHrP  may  also  affect  the  initiation  and  progression  of  tumors  by 
acting through pro-survival and chemokine pathways.

PTHrP  is  structurally  related  to  PTH  and  binds  to  the  PTH 
receptor,  explaining  the  similar  biochemical  features  of  HHM  and 
hyperparathyroidism. PTHrP plays a key physiologic role in skeletal 
development and regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation in 
other tissues, including skin, bone marrow, breast, and hair follicles. 
The  mechanism  of  PTHrP  induction  in  malignancy  is  incompletely 
understood;  however,  tumor-bearing  tissues  commonly  associated 
with  HHM  normally  produce  PTHrP  during  development  or  cell 
renewal. PTHrP expression is stimulated by hedgehog pathways and 
Gli transcription factors that are active in many malignancies. Trans-
forming growth factor β (TGF-β), which is produced by many tumors, 
also stimulates PTHrP. Mutations in certain oncogenes, such as Ras, 
also  can  activate  PTHrP  expression,  as  does  loss  of  the  tumor  sup-
pressor, p53. In addition to its role in HHM, the PTHrP pathway may 
also provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention to impede 
cancer growth.

Another relatively common cause of HHM is excess production of 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D.  Like  granulomatous  disorders  associated 
with hypercalcemia, lymphomas can produce an enzyme that converts 
25-hydroxyvitamin  D  to  the  more  active  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D, 
leading to enhanced gastrointestinal calcium absorption. Other causes 
of  HHM  include  tumor-mediated  production  of  osteolytic  cytokines 
and inflammatory mediators.

Clinical  Manifestations  The  typical  presentation  of  HHM  is  a 
patient with a known malignancy who is found to be hypercalcemic on 
routine laboratory tests. Less often, hypercalcemia is the initial present-
ing feature of malignancy. Particularly when calcium levels are mark-
edly  increased  (>3.5  mmol/L  [>14  mg/dL]),  patients  may  experience 
fatigue, mental status changes, polyuria, dehydration, or symptoms of 
nephrolithiasis. Hypercalcemia can shorten ST segments and QT inter-
vals, as well as bundle branch blocks and bradyarrhythmias.

Diagnosis  Features that favor HHM, as opposed to primary hyper-
parathyroidism, include known malignancy, recent onset of hypercal-
cemia, and very high serum calcium levels. Like hyperparathyroidism, 
hypercalcemia  caused  by  PTHrP  is  accompanied  by  hypercalciuria 
and hypophosphatemia. Patients with HHM typically have metabolic 
alkalosis  rather  than  hyperchloremic  acidosis,  as  is  seen  in  hyper-
parathyroidism.  Measurement  of  PTH  is  useful  to  exclude  primary 
hyperparathyroidism;  the  PTH  level  should  be  suppressed  in  HHM. 
An elevated PTHrP level confirms the diagnosis, and it is increased in 
~80% of hypercalcemic patients with cancer. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 
levels may be increased in patients with lymphoma.

TREATMENT
Humoral Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

The management of HHM begins with removal of excess calcium 
in the diet, medications, or IV solutions. Saline rehydration (typi-
cally 200–500 mL/h) is used to dilute serum calcium and promote 
calciuresis;  exercise  caution  in  patients  with  cardiac,  hepatic,  or 
renal insufficiency. Forced diuresis with furosemide (20–80 mg IV 
in  escalating  doses)  or  other  loop  diuretics  can  enhance  calcium 
excretion but provides relatively little value except in life-threaten-
ing hypercalcemia. When used, loop diuretics should be adminis-
tered only after complete rehydration and with careful monitoring 
of fluid balance. Oral phosphorus (e.g., 250 mg Neutra-Phos 3–4 
times daily) should be given until serum phosphorus is >1 mmol/L 
(>3  mg/dL).  Bisphosphonates  such  as  pamidronate  (60–90  mg 
IV), zoledronate (4–8 mg IV), and etidronate (7.5 mg/kg per day 
PO  for  3–7  consecutive  days)  can  reduce  serum  calcium  within 
1–2 days and suppress calcium release for several weeks. Bisphos-
phonate infusions can be repeated, or oral bisphosphonates can be 
used  for  chronic  treatment.  Denosumab  (120  mg  SC  weekly  for 
4  weeks  and  then  monthly)  can  be  used  in  patients  who  do  not 
respond adequately to bisphosphonates. It acts as a decoy receptor 
for  RANK  ligand  to  mitigate  stimulation  of  osteoclasts.  Cinacal-
cet (30 mg PO bid to 90 mg PO qid) stimulates calcium-sensing 
receptors to suppress PTH secretion and is therefore applicable in 
parathyroid  carcinoma  and  rare  cases  of  ectopic  PTH-producing 
tumors. Hypercalcemia associated with lymphomas, multiple mye-
loma, or leukemia may respond to glucocorticoid treatment (e.g., 
prednisone 40–100 mg PO in four divided doses). Dialysis should 
be considered in severe hypercalcemia when saline hydration and 
bisphosphonate  treatments  are  not  possible  or  are  too  slow  in 
onset. Previously used agents such as calcitonin and mithramycin 
have  little  utility  now  that  bisphosphonates  and  other  agents  are 
available.

Etiology  Vasopressin  is  an  antidiuretic  hormone  normally  pro-
duced by the posterior pituitary gland. Ectopic vasopressin production 
by tumors is a common cause of the syndrome of inappropriate anti-
diuretic hormone (SIADH), occurring in at least half of patients with 
SCLC. SIADH also can be caused by a number of nonneoplastic condi-
tions, including central nervous system (CNS) trauma, infections, and 
medications (Chap. 381). Compensatory responses to SIADH, such as 
decreased thirst, may mitigate the development of hyponatremia. How-
ever, with prolonged production of excessive vasopressin, the osmostat 
controlling thirst and hypothalamic vasopressin secretion may become 
reset.  In  addition,  intake  of  free  water,  orally  or  intravenously,  can 
quickly worsen hyponatremia because of reduced renal diuresis.

Tumors with neuroendocrine features, such as SCLC and carcinoids, 
are the most common sources of ectopic vasopressin production, but 
it  also  occurs  in  other  forms  of  lung  cancer  and  with  CNS  lesions, 
head and neck cancer, and genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and ovarian 
cancers. The mechanism of activation of the vasopressin gene in these 
tumors  is  unknown,  but  the  frequent  concomitant  expression  of  the 
adjacent oxytocin gene suggests derepression of this locus. 

Clinical  Manifestations  Most  patients  with  ectopic  vasopressin 
secretion are asymptomatic and are identified because of the presence 
of hyponatremia on routine chemistry testing. Symptoms may include 
weakness,  lethargy,  nausea,  confusion,  depressed  mental  status,  and 
seizures. The severity of symptoms reflects the rapidity of onset as well 
as the severity of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia usually develops slowly 
but may be exacerbated by the administration of IV fluids or the insti-
tution of new medications. 

Diagnosis  The  diagnostic  features  of  ectopic  vasopressin  produc-
tion are the same as those of other causes of SIADH (Chaps. 53 and 
381). Hyponatremia and reduced serum osmolality occur in the setting 
of  an  inappropriately  normal  or  increased  urine  osmolality.  Urine 
sodium  excretion  is  normal  or  increased  unless  volume  depletion  is 
present. Other causes of hyponatremia should be excluded, including 
renal,  adrenal,  or  thyroid  insufficiency.  Physiologic  sources  of  vaso-
pressin stimulation (CNS lesions, pulmonary disease, nausea), adaptive 
circulatory  mechanisms  (hypotension,  heart  failure,  hepatic  cirrho-
sis),  and  medications,  including  many  chemotherapeutic  agents,  also 
should be considered as possible causes of hyponatremia. Vasopressin 
measurements are not usually necessary to make the diagnosis.

TREATMENT
Ectopic Vasopressin: Tumor-Associated SIADH

Most  patients  with  ectopic  vasopressin  production  develop  hypona-
tremia over several weeks or months. The disorder should be corrected 
gradually  unless  mental  status  is  altered  or  there  is  risk  of  seizures. 
Rapid  correction  can  cause  brain  dehydration  and  central  pontine 
myelinolysis.  Treatment  of  the  underlying  malignancy  may  reduce 
ectopic vasopressin production, but this response is slow if it occurs 
at all. Fluid restriction to less than urine output, plus insensible losses, 
is  often  sufficient  to  correct  hyponatremia  partially.  However,  strict 
monitoring of the amount and types of liquids consumed or admin-
istered  intravenously  is  required  for  fluid  restriction  to  be  effective. 
Salt tablets and saline are not helpful unless volume depletion is also 
present.  Demeclocycline  (150–300  mg  orally  3–4  times  daily)  can 
be  used  to  inhibit  vasopressin  action  on  the  renal  distal  tubule,  but 
its  onset  of  action  is  relatively  slow  (1–2  weeks).  The  vaptan  class 
of  drugs  acts  by  inhibiting  vasopressin  receptors  (V1A,  V1B,  V2)  in 
the  renal  collecting  ducts.  Conivaptan,  a  nonpeptide  V2-receptor 
antagonist,  can  be  administered  either  PO  (20–120  mg  bid)  or  IV   
(10–40  mg)  and  is  particularly  effective  when  used  in  combina-
tion  with  fluid  restriction  in  euvolemic  hyponatremia.  Tolvaptan   
(15 mg PO daily) is another vasopressin antagonist. The dose can be 
increased to 30–60 mg/d based on response. Severe hyponatremia 
(Na <115 meq/L) or mental status changes may require treatment 
with  hypertonic  (3%)  or  normal  saline  infusion  together  with 
furosemide  to  enhance  free  water  clearance.  The  rate  of  sodium

correction  should  be  slow  (0.5–1  meq/L  per  hour)  to  prevent 
rapid fluid shifts and the possible development of central pontine 
myelinolysis.

 ■ CUSHING’S SYNDROME CAUSED BY ECTOPIC 
ACTH PRODUCTION
(See also Chap. 386)

Etiology  Ectopic ACTH production accounts for 10–20% of cases 
of  Cushing’s  syndrome.  The  syndrome  is  particularly  common  in 
neuroendocrine tumors. SCLC is the most common cause of ectopic 
ACTH, followed by bronchial and thymic carcinoids, islet cell tumors, 
other carcinoids, and pheochromocytomas. Ectopic ACTH production 
is caused by increased expression of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) 
gene, which encodes ACTH, along with melanocyte-stimulating hor-
mone (MSH), β lipotropin, and several other peptides. In many tumors, 
there is abundant but aberrant expression of the POMC gene from an 
internal promoter, proximal to the third exon, which encodes ACTH. 
However, because this product lacks the signal sequence necessary for 
protein processing, it is not secreted. Increased production of ACTH 
arises instead from less abundant, but unregulated, POMC expression 
from  the  same  promoter  site  used  in  the  pituitary.  Because  tumors 
lack many of the enzymes needed to process the POMC polypeptide, 
it is typically released as multiple large, biologically inactive fragments 
along with relatively small amounts of fully processed, active ACTH.

Rarely, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is produced by pan-
creatic islet cell tumors, SCLC, medullary thyroid cancer, carcinoids, or 
prostate cancer. When levels are high enough, CRH can cause pituitary 
corticotrope  hyperplasia  and  Cushing’s  syndrome.  Tumors  that  pro-
duce CRH sometimes also produce ACTH, raising the possibility of a 
paracrine mechanism for ACTH production.

A distinct mechanism for ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome 
involves ectopic expression of various G protein–coupled receptors in 
adrenal  nodules.  Ectopic  expression  of  the  gastric  inhibitory  peptide 
(GIP) receptor is the best-characterized example of this mechanism. In 
this case, meals induce GIP secretion, which inappropriately stimulates 
adrenal growth and glucocorticoid production.

Clinical  Manifestations  The  clinical  features  of  hypercorti-
solemia  are  detected  in  only  a  fraction  of  patients  with  documented 
ectopic ACTH production. Patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome gen-
erally exhibit less marked weight gain and centripetal fat redistribution, 
probably  because  the  exposure  to  excess  glucocorticoids  is  relatively 
brief and because cachexia reduces the propensity for weight gain and 
fat deposition. The ectopic ACTH syndrome is associated with several 
clinical  features  that  distinguish  it  from  other  causes  of  Cushing’s 
syndrome  (e.g.,  pituitary  adenomas,  adrenal  adenomas,  iatrogenic 
glucocorticoid excess). The metabolic manifestations of ectopic ACTH 
syndrome  are  dominated  by  fluid  retention  and  hypertension,  hypo-
kalemia,  metabolic  alkalosis,  glucose  intolerance,  and  occasionally 
steroid  psychosis.  The  very  high  ACTH  levels  often  cause  increased 
pigmentation,  reflecting  increased  activity  of  MSH  derived  from  the 
POMC  precursor  peptide.  The  extraordinarily  high  glucocorticoid 
levels  in  patients  with  ectopic  sources  of  ACTH  can  lead  to  marked 
skin  fragility  and  easy  bruising.  In  addition,  the  high  cortisol  levels 
often overwhelm the renal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II 
enzyme, which normally inactivates cortisol and prevents it from bind-
ing to renal mineralocorticoid receptors. Consequently, in addition to 
the  excess  mineralocorticoids  produced  by  ACTH  stimulation  of  the 
adrenal gland, high levels of cortisol exert activity through the miner-
alocorticoid receptor, leading to severe hypokalemia.

Diagnosis  The  diagnosis  of  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome  is  usually 
not  difficult  in  the  setting  of  a  known  malignancy.  Urine-free  cor-
tisol  levels  fluctuate  but  are  typically  greater  than  two  to  four  times 
normal, and the plasma ACTH level is usually >22 pmol/L (>100 pg/
mL). A suppressed ACTH level excludes this diagnosis and indicates 
an ACTH-independent cause of Cushing’s syndrome (e.g., adrenal or 
exogenous glucocorticoid). In contrast to pituitary sources of ACTH, 

most ectopic sources of ACTH do not respond to glucocorticoid sup-
pression. Therefore, high-dose dexamethasone (8 mg PO) suppresses 
8:00 a.m. serum cortisol (50% decrease from baseline) in ~80% of pitu-
itary ACTH-producing adenomas but fails to suppress ectopic ACTH 
in ~90% of cases. Bronchial and other carcinoids are well-documented 
exceptions  to  these  general  guidelines,  as  these  ectopic  sources  of 
ACTH  may  exhibit  feedback  regulation  indistinguishable  from  pitu-
itary  adenomas,  including  suppression  by  high-dose  dexamethasone, 
and  ACTH  responsiveness  to  adrenal  blockade  with  metyrapone.  If 
necessary,  petrosal  sinus  catheterization  can  be  used  to  evaluate  a 
patient with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome when the source of 
ACTH is unclear. After CRH stimulation, a 3:1 petrosal sinus:peripheral 
ACTH ratio strongly suggests a pituitary ACTH source. Imaging stud-
ies  (computed  tomography  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging)  are  also 
useful in the evaluation of suspected carcinoid lesions, allowing biopsy 
and  characterization  of  hormone  production  using  special  stains.  If 
available,  positron  emission  tomography  or  octreotide  scanning  may 
identify some sources of ACTH production.

TREATMENT
Cushing’s Syndrome Caused by Ectopic ACTH 
Production

The  morbidity  associated  with  the  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome  can 
be  substantial.  Patients  may  experience  depression  or  personality 
changes  because  of  extreme  cortisol  excess.  Metabolic  derange-
ments,  including  diabetes  mellitus  and  hypokalemia,  can  worsen 
fatigue.  Poor  wound  healing  and  predisposition  to  infections  can 
complicate  the  surgical  management  of  tumors,  and  opportunis-
tic  infections  caused  by  organisms  such  as  Pneumocystis  carinii 
and mycoses are often the cause of death in patients with ectopic 
ACTH  production.  These  patients  have  increased  risk  of  venous 
thromboembolism  reflecting  the  combination  of  malignancy  and 
altered  coagulation  factor  profiles.  Depending  on  prognosis  and 
treatment plans for the underlying malignancy, measures to reduce 
cortisol  levels  are  often  indicated.  Treatment  of  the  underlying 
malignancy  may  reduce  ACTH  levels  but  is  rarely  sufficient  to 
reduce cortisol levels to normal. Adrenalectomy is not practical for 
most of these patients but should be considered during surgery for 
the malignancy or if the underlying tumor is not resectable and the 
prognosis is otherwise favorable (e.g., carcinoid). Medical therapy 
with ketoconazole (300–600 mg PO bid), metyrapone (250–500 mg 
PO every 6 h), mitotane (3–6 g PO in four divided doses, tapered 
to maintain low cortisol production), etomidate (0.1–0.3 mg/kg/h 
IV), or other agents that block steroid synthesis or action is often 
the most practical strategy for managing the hypercortisolism asso-
ciated with ectopic ACTH production. Glucocorticoid replacement 
should  be  provided  to  prevent  adrenal  insufficiency  (Chap.  386). 
Unfortunately,  many  patients  eventually  progress  despite  medical 
blockade.  Mifepristone  (200–1000  mg  PO  qd)  inhibits  both  glu-
cocorticoid and progesterone receptors, has rapid onset of action, 
and  improves  glucose  intolerance  and  hypertension  in  a  subset 
of  patients.  ACTH-neutralizing  antibodies  and  ACTH  receptor 
blockers  are  under  investigation,  as  are  selective  inhibitors  of  the 
glucocorticoid receptor.

 ■ TUMOR-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA CAUSED BY 
EXCESS PRODUCTION OF INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH 
FACTOR TYPE II
(See  also  Chap.  406)  Mesenchymal  tumors,  hemangiopericytomas, 
hepatocellular tumors, adrenal carcinomas, and a variety of other large 
tumors have been reported to produce excessive amounts of insulin-
like  growth  factor  type  II  (IGF-II)  precursor,  which  binds  weakly  to 
insulin  receptors  and  more  strongly  to  IGF-I  receptors,  leading  to 
insulin-like  actions.  The  gene  encoding  IGF-II  resides  on  chromo-
some  11p15,  a  locus  that  is  normally  imprinted  (that  is,  expression 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   724

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyis exclusively from a single parental allele). Biallelic expression of the 
IGF-II gene occurs in a subset of tumors, suggesting loss of methylation 
and loss of imprinting as a mechanism for gene induction. In addition 
to increased IGF-II production, IGF-II bioavailability is increased due 
to complex alterations in circulating binding proteins. Increased IGF-II 
suppresses  growth  hormone  (GH)  and  insulin,  resulting  in  reduced 
IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), IGF-I, and acid-labile subunit (ALS). 
The reduction in ALS and IGFBP-3, which normally sequester IGF-II, 
causes it to be displaced to a small circulating complex that has greater 
access to insulin target tissues. For this reason, circulating IGF-II levels 
may not be markedly increased despite causing hypoglycemia. In addi-
tion to IGF-II–mediated hypoglycemia, tumors may occupy enough of 
the liver to impair gluconeogenesis.

In most cases, a tumor causing hypoglycemia is clinically apparent 
(usually  >10  cm  in  size),  and  hypoglycemia  develops  in  association 
with fasting. As with other causes of hypoglycemia, patients may pres-
ent with sweating, tremors, palpitations, confusion, seizures, or coma. 
The  diagnosis  is  made  by  documenting  low  serum  glucose  and  sup-
pressed insulin levels in association with symptoms of hypoglycemia. 
Serum IGF-II levels may not be increased (IGF-II assays may not detect 
IGF-II precursors), but an elevated IGF-II/IGF-I ratio greater than 10:1 
is suggestive. Increased IGF-II mRNA expression is found in most of 
these tumors. Any medications associated with hypoglycemia should 
be  eliminated.  Treatment  of  the  underlying  malignancy,  if  possible, 
may  reduce  the  predisposition  to  hypoglycemia.  Frequent  meals  and 
IV  glucose,  especially  during  sleep  or  fasting,  are  often  necessary  to 
prevent  hypoglycemia.  Glucagon  and  glucocorticoids  have  also  been 
used  to  enhance  glucose  production.  Antibodies  that  inhibit  IGF-II 
action are under development.

 ■ HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN
hCG is composed of α and β subunits and can be produced as intact 
hormone, which is biologically active, or as uncombined biologically 
inert  subunits.  Ectopic  production  of  intact  hCG  occurs  most  often 
in  association  with  testicular  embryonal  tumors,  germ  cell  tumors, 
extragonadal  germinomas,  lung  cancer,  hepatoma,  and  pancreatic 
islet  tumors.  Eutopic  production  of  hCG  occurs  with  trophoblastic 
malignancies.  hCG  α  subunit  production  is  particularly  common 
in  lung  cancer  and  pancreatic  islet  cancer.  In  men,  high  hCG  levels 
stimulate  steroidogenesis  and  aromatase  activity  in  testicular  Leydig 
cells, resulting in increased estrogen production and the development 
of gynecomastia. Precocious puberty in boys or gynecomastia in men 
should prompt measurement of hCG and consideration of a testicular 
tumor or another source of ectopic hCG production. Most women are 
asymptomatic. hCG is easily measured. Treatment should be directed 
at the underlying malignancy.

 ■ ONCOGENIC OSTEOMALACIA
Hypophosphatemic oncogenic osteomalacia, also called tumor-induced 
osteomalacia (TIO), is caused by excessive production of fibroblast growth 
factor  23  (FGF23),  previously  referred  to  as  phosphotonin.  Oncogenic 
osteomalacia  is  characterized  by  markedly  reduced  serum  phosphorus 
and renal phosphate wasting, leading to muscle weakness, bone pain, and 
osteomalacia. Serum calcium and PTH levels are normal. FGF23 inhibits 
the renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 
resulting in low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Oncogenic osteomalacia 
is usually caused by benign mesenchymal tumors, such as hemangioperi-
cytomas, fibromas, and giant cell tumors, often of the skeletal extremities 
or  head.  It  has  also  been  described  in  sarcomas  and  in  patients  with 
prostate or lung cancer. Resection of the tumor reverses the disorder, 
confirming its humoral basis. FGF23 levels are increased in some, but 
not all, patients with osteogenic osteomalacia. FGF23 forms a ternary 
complex  with  the  klotho  protein  and  renal  FGF  receptors  to  reduce 
renal  phosphate  reabsorption.  Treatment  involves  removal  of  the 
tumor, if possible, and supplementation with phosphate and vitamin D. 
Octreotide treatment reduces phosphate wasting in some patients with 
tumors that express somatostatin receptor subtype 2. Octreotide scans 
may  also  be  useful  in  detecting  these  tumors.  The  calcium-sensing 

receptor agonist, cinacalcet, has been effective in some patients, appar-
ently by reducing PTH-mediated phosphaturia. FGF receptor inhibi-
tors hold promise as future therapies targeted either to pathways that 
stimulate  FGR23  production  (e.g.,  FGFR1)  or  inhibit  its  action  (e.g., 
FGF23 receptor).

 ■ CONSUMPTIVE HYPOTHYROIDISM
Newborns  with  hepatic  hemangiomas  can  develop  a  rare  form  of 
hypothyroidism caused by overexpression of type 3 deiodinase (D3), 
an enzyme that degrades and inactivates thyroxine (T4) and triiodothy-
ronine (T3). The very high expression of D3 and consumption of thy-
roid hormones apparently outstrip the thyroid gland’s rate of hormone 
production. The disorder is characterized by low T4, low T3, high TSH, 
and  markedly  elevated  reverse  T3  (rT3),  reflecting  the  degradation  of 
T4 to rT3. In addition to treating the underlying hemangioma (rarely 
other tumor types), patients are treated with l-thyroxine replacement, 
titrated to normalize TSH. Steroids and propranolol may provide ben-
efit, perhaps by inhibiting growth factor pathways thought to stimulate 
D3 production.

HEMATOLOGIC SYNDROMES
The elevation of granulocyte, platelet, and eosinophil counts in most 
patients  with  myeloproliferative  disorders  is  caused  by  the  prolifer-
ation  of  the  myeloid  elements  due  to  the  underlying  disease  rather 
than  to  a  paraneoplastic  syndrome.  The  paraneoplastic  hematologic 
syndromes  in  patients  with  solid  tumors  are  less  well  characterized 
than are the endocrine syndromes because the ectopic hormone(s) or 
cytokines responsible have not been identified in most of these tumors  
(Table 93-2). The extent of the paraneoplastic syndromes parallels the 
course of the cancer. With very rare exception, red cell, white cell or 
platelet numbers are self-limited and not associated with symptomatic 
abnormalities. In some circumstances, elevations in platelet counts can 
be a marker that influences prognosis. By far, the most consequential 
hematologic abnormality in cancer patients is hypercoagulability.

 ■ ERYTHROCYTOSIS
Ectopic  production  of  erythropoietin  by  cancer  cells  causes  most 
paraneoplastic  erythrocytosis.  The  ectopically  produced  erythropoi-
etin stimulates the production of red blood cells (RBCs) in the bone 
marrow and raises the hematocrit. Other lymphokines and hormones 
produced by cancer cells may stimulate erythropoietin release but have 
not been proved to cause erythrocytosis.

Most  patients  with  erythrocytosis  have  an  elevated  hematocrit 
(>52% in men, >48% in women) that is detected on a routine blood

count.  Approximately  3%  of  patients  with  renal  cell  cancer,  10%  of 
patients  with  hepatoma,  and  15%  of  patients  with  cerebellar  heman-
gioblastomas have erythrocytosis. In most cases, the erythrocytosis is 
asymptomatic.

Patients with erythrocytosis due to a renal cell cancer, hepatoma, or 
CNS cancer should have measurement of red cell mass. If the red cell 
mass is elevated, the serum erythropoietin level should be measured. 
Patients  with  a  cancer  that  has  been  associated  with  erythrocytosis, 
elevated  erythropoietin  levels,  and  no  other  explanation  for  erythro-
cytosis  (e.g.,  hemoglobinopathy  that  causes  increased  O2  affinity;  
Chaps. 63 and 98) have the paraneoplastic syndrome.

produce IL-5, which stimulates eosinophil growth. Activation of IL-5 
transcription in lymphomas and leukemias may involve translocation 
of the long arm of chromosome 5, to which the genes for IL-5 and other 
cytokines map.

Patients with eosinophilia are typically asymptomatic. Eosinophilia 
is present in 10% of patients with lymphoma, 3% of patients with lung 
cancer,  and  occasional  patients  with  cervical,  gastrointestinal,  renal, 
and breast cancer. Patients with markedly elevated eosinophil counts 
(>5000/μL)  can  develop  shortness  of  breath  and  wheezing.  A  chest 
radiograph  may  reveal  diffuse  pulmonary  infiltrates  from  eosinophil 
infiltration and activation in the lungs.

TREATMENT
Erythrocytosis

TREATMENT
Eosinophilia

Successful  resection  of  the  cancer  usually  resolves  the  erythrocy-
tosis.  If  the  tumor  cannot  be  resected  or  treated  effectively  with 
radiation  therapy  or  chemotherapy,  phlebotomy  may  control  any 
symptoms or risk related to erythrocytosis.

 ■ GRANULOCYTOSIS
Approximately  30%  of  patients  with  solid  tumors  have  granulocy-
tosis  (granulocyte  count  >8000/μL).  In  about  half  of  patients  with 
granulocytosis  and  cancer,  the  granulocytosis  has  an  identifiable 
nonparaneoplastic etiology (e.g., infection, tumor necrosis, glucocor-
ticoid administration). The other patients have proteins in urine and 
serum  that  stimulate  the  growth  of  bone  marrow  cells.  Tumors  and 
tumor cell lines from patients with lung, ovarian, and bladder cancers 
have  been  documented  to  produce  granulocyte  colony-stimulating 
factor  (G-CSF),  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor 
(GM-CSF), and/or interleukin 6 (IL-6). However, the etiology of gran-
ulocytosis has not been characterized in most patients.

Patients  with  granulocytosis  are  nearly  all  asymptomatic,  and  the 
differential white blood cell count does not have a shift to immature 
forms  of  neutrophils.  Granulocytosis  occurs  in  40%  of  patients  with 
lung and gastrointestinal cancers, 20% of patients with breast cancer, 
30% of patients with brain tumors and ovarian cancers, 20% of patients 
with Hodgkin’s disease, and 10% of patients with renal cell carcinoma. 
Patients with advanced-stage disease are more likely to have granulo-
cytosis than are those with early-stage disease.

Paraneoplastic granulocytosis does not require treatment. The gran-

ulocytosis resolves when the underlying cancer is treated.

 ■ THROMBOCYTOSIS
Some  35%  of  patients  with  thrombocytosis  (platelet  count  >400,000/
μL) have an underlying diagnosis of cancer. IL-6, a candidate molecule 
for the etiology of paraneoplastic thrombocytosis, stimulates the pro-
duction of platelets in vitro and in vivo. Some patients with cancer and 
thrombocytosis have elevated levels of IL-6 in plasma. Another candi-
date  molecule  is  thrombopoietin,  a  peptide  hormone  that  stimulates 
megakaryocyte  proliferation  and  platelet  production.  The  etiology  of 
thrombocytosis has not been established in most cases.

Patients with thrombocytosis are nearly all asymptomatic. Throm-
bocytosis  is  not  clearly  linked  to  thrombosis  in  patients  with  cancer. 
Thrombocytosis  is  present  in  40%  of  patients  with  lung  and  gas-
trointestinal  cancers;  20%  of  patients  with  breast,  endometrial,  and 
ovarian  cancers;  and  10%  of  patients  with  lymphoma.  Patients  with 
thrombocytosis  are  more  likely  to  have  advanced-stage  disease  and 
have a poorer prognosis than do patients without thrombocytosis. In 
ovarian cancer, IL-6 has been shown to directly promote tumor growth. 
Paraneoplastic thrombocytosis does not require treatment other than 
treatment of the underlying tumor.

 ■ EOSINOPHILIA
Eosinophilia  is  present  in  ~1%  of  patients  with  cancer.  Tumors  and 
tumor  cell  lines  from  patients  with  lymphomas  or  leukemia  may 

Definitive  treatment  is  directed  at  the  underlying  malignancy. 
Tumors  should  be  resected  or  treated  with  radiation  or  chemo-
therapy. In most patients who develop shortness of breath related 
to eosinophilia, symptoms resolve with the use of oral or inhaled 
glucocorticoids. IL-5 antagonists exist but have not been evaluated 
in this clinical setting.

 ■ THROMBOPHLEBITIS AND DEEP VENOUS 
THROMBOSIS
Deep  venous  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism  are  the  most 
common  thrombotic  conditions  in  patients  with  cancer.  Migratory 
or  recurrent  thrombophlebitis  may  be  the  initial  manifestation  of 
cancer. Nearly 15% of patients who develop deep venous thrombosis 
or pulmonary embolism have a diagnosis of cancer (Chap. 117). The 
coexistence of peripheral venous thrombosis with visceral carcinoma, 
particularly pancreatic cancer, is called Trousseau’s syndrome.

Pathogenesis  Patients with cancer are predisposed to thromboem-
bolism because they are often at bed rest or immobilized, and tumors 
may  obstruct  or  slow  blood  flow.  Postoperative  deep  venous  throm-
bosis  is  twice  as  common  in  cancer  patients  who  undergo  surgery. 
Chronic IV catheters also predispose to clotting. In addition, clotting 
may be promoted by release of procoagulants or cytokines from tumor 
cells or associated inflammatory cells or by platelet adhesion or aggre-
gation.  The  specific  molecules  that  promote  thromboembolism  have 
not been identified.

Chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those associated with endo-
thelial  damage,  can  induce  venous  thrombosis.  The  annual  risk  of 
venous  thrombosis  in  patients  with  cancer  receiving  chemotherapy 
is  about  11%,  sixfold  higher  than  the  risk  in  the  general  population. 
Bleomycin, l-asparaginase, nitrogen mustard, thalidomide analogues, 
cisplatin-based regimens, and high doses of busulfan and carmustine 
are all associated with an increased risk.

In addition to cancer and its treatment causing secondary thrombo-
sis, primary thrombophilic diseases may be associated with cancer. For 
example,  the  antiphospholipid  antibody  syndrome  is  associated  with 
a wide range of pathologic manifestations (Chap. 357). About 20% of 
patients with this syndrome have cancers. Among patients with cancer 
and antiphospholipid antibodies, 35–45% develop thrombosis.

Clinical  Manifestations  Patients  with  cancer  who  develop  deep 
venous  thrombosis  usually  develop  swelling  or  pain  in  the  leg,  and 
physical examination reveals tenderness, warmth, and redness. Patients 
who present with pulmonary embolism develop dyspnea, chest pain, 
and  syncope,  and  physical  examination  shows  tachycardia,  cyanosis, 
and hypotension. Some 5% of patients with no history of cancer who 
have a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism 
will  have  a  diagnosis  of  cancer  within  1  year.  The  most  common 
cancers associated with thromboembolic episodes include lung, pan-
creatic,  gastrointestinal,  breast,  ovarian,  and  genitourinary  cancers; 
lymphomas;  and  brain  tumors.  Patients  with  cancer  who  undergo 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   726

21/01/22   3:50 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologysurgical procedures requiring general anesthesia have a 20–30% risk of 
deep venous thrombosis.

Diagnosis  The  diagnosis  of  deep  venous  thrombosis  in  patients 
with  cancer  is  made  by  impedance  plethysmography  or  bilateral 
compression ultrasonography of the leg veins. Patients with a noncom-
pressible  venous  segment  have  deep  venous  thrombosis.  If  compres-
sion ultrasonography is normal and there is a high clinical suspicion 
for deep venous thrombosis, venography should be done to look for a 
luminal filling defect. Elevation of d-dimer is not as predictive of deep 
venous thrombosis in patients with cancer as it is in patients without 
cancer; elevations are seen in people over age 65 years without concom-
itant evidence of thrombosis, probably as a consequence of increased 
thrombin deposition and turnover in aging.

Patients  with  symptoms  and  signs  suggesting  a  pulmonary  embo-
lism should be evaluated with a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, 
arterial  blood  gas  analysis,  and  ventilation-perfusion  scan.  Patients 
with  mismatched  segmental  perfusion  defects  have  a  pulmonary 
embolus. Patients with equivocal ventilation-perfusion findings should 
be evaluated as described above for deep venous thrombosis in their 
legs.  If  deep  venous  thrombosis  is  detected,  they  should  be  antico-
agulated.  If  deep  venous  thrombosis  is  not  detected,  they  should  be 
considered for a pulmonary angiogram.

Patients  without  a  diagnosis  of  cancer  who  present  with  an  initial 
episode of thrombophlebitis or pulmonary embolus need no additional 
tests  for  cancer  other  than  a  careful  history  and  physical  examina-
tion. In light of the many possible primary sites, diagnostic testing in 
asymptomatic patients is wasteful. However, if the clot is refractory to 
standard treatment or is in an unusual site, or if the thrombophlebitis 
is  migratory  or  recurrent,  efforts  to  find  an  underlying  cancer  are 
indicated.

TREATMENT
Thrombophlebitis and Deep Venous Thrombosis

Patients  with  cancer  and  a  diagnosis  of  deep  venous  thrombo-
sis  or  pulmonary  embolism  should  be  treated  initially  with  IV 
unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin for at least  
5 days, and warfarin should be started within 1 or 2 days. The war-
farin dose should be adjusted so that the international normalized 
ratio  (INR)  is  2–3.  Patients  with  proximal  deep  venous  throm-
bosis  and  a  relative  contraindication  to  heparin  anticoagulation 
(hemorrhagic  brain  metastases  or  pericardial  effusion)  should  be 
considered for placement of a filter in the inferior vena cava (Green-
field  filter)  to  prevent  pulmonary  embolism.  Warfarin  should  be 
administered for 3–6 months. An alternative approach is to use low- 
molecular-weight  heparin  for  6  months.  The  new  oral  anticoagu-
lants (factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors) are attractive because they 
do  not  require  close  monitoring  of  the  prothrombin  time  and  are 
not affected by dietary factors. Oral apixaban (10 mg bid for 7 days 
followed by 5 mg bid for 6 months) is noninferior to dalteparin in 
the treatment of cancer patients who develop deep vein thrombosis 
or pulmonary embolism. Patients with cancer who undergo a major 
surgical procedure should be considered for heparin prophylaxis or 
pneumatic boots. Breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy 
and  patients  with  implanted  catheters  should  be  considered  for 
prophylaxis. Guidelines recommend that hospitalized patients with 
cancer and patients receiving a thalidomide analogue receive pro-
phylaxis  with  low-molecular-weight  heparin  or  low-dose  aspirin. 
Use of prophylaxis routinely during chemotherapy is controversial. 
Risk is affected by type of cancer, type of therapy, blood counts, and 
body mass index (all taken into account in the Khorana risk score; 
Table 93-3). Studies of Khorana high-risk patients with cancer using 
rivaroxaban and apixaban as clot prophylaxis have resulted in a 50% 
reduction  in  risk  with  a  level  of  bleeding  of  about  5%.  However,

MISCELLANEOUS REMOTE EFFECTS OF 
CANCER
Patients  with  cancer  can  develop  paraneoplastic  autoimmune  disor-
ders (e.g., thrombocytopenia) and dysfunction of organs not directly 
invaded or involved with the cancer (rheumatologic and renal abnor-
malities  are  among  the  most  frequent).  The  pathogenesis  of  these 
disorders is undefined, but often, the conditions reverse if the tumor is 
removed or successfully treated.

Cutaneous  paraneoplastic  syndromes  are  discussed  in  Chap.  58. 

Neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes are discussed in Chap. 94.

94 Paraneoplastic Neurologic 
Syndromes and  
Autoimmune Encephalitis
Josep Dalmau, Myrna R. Rosenfeld,  
Francesc Graus

Paraneoplastic  neurologic  disorders  (PNDs)  are  cancer-related  syn-
dromes  that  can  affect  any  part  of  the  nervous  system  (Table  94-1). 
They are caused by mechanisms other than metastasis or by any of the 
complications  of  cancer  such  as  coagulopathy,  stroke,  metabolic  and 
nutritional conditions, infections, and side effects of cancer therapy. In 
60% of patients, the neurologic symptoms precede the cancer diagno-
sis. Clinically disabling PNDs occur in 0.5–1% of all cancer patients, 
but they affect 2–3% of patients with neuroblastoma or small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) and 30–50% of patients with thymoma.

PATHOGENESIS
Most PNDs are mediated by immune responses triggered by neuronal 
proteins ectopically expressed by tumors (e.g., SCLC and other cancers) 
or as a result of altered immunologic responses caused by some types of 
tumors such as thymomas or lymphomas. In PNDs of the central ner-
vous system (CNS), many antibody-associated immune responses have 
been identified (Table 94-2). These antibodies react with neurons and 
the patient’s tumor, and their detection in serum or cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) usually predicts the presence of cancer. When the antigens are 
intracellular, most syndromes are associated with extensive infiltrates 
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, microglial activation, gliosis, and variable 
neuronal  loss.  The  infiltrating  T  cells  are  often  in  close  contact  with 
neurons  undergoing  degeneration,  suggesting  a  primary  pathogenic 
role. T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity may contribute directly to cell death 
in these PNDs and probably underlies the resistance of many of these 
conditions to therapy.

In contrast to the predominant role of cytotoxic T-cell mechanisms 
in PND associated with antibodies against intracellular antigens, those 
associated with antibodies to antigens expressed on the neuronal cell 
surface of the CNS or at the neuromuscular junction are mediated by

direct antibody effects on the target antigens and are more responsive 
to immunotherapy (Table 94-3, Fig. 94-1). These disorders occur with 
and without a cancer association and may affect children and young 
adults. Some disorders are triggered by viral encephalitis such as herpes 
simplex virus encephalitis or Japanese encephalitis, leading to autoim-
mune encephalitis.

In  patients  with  cancer,  the  use  of  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors 
is  associated  in  rare  instances  with  immune-related  adverse  events 
accompanied by neuronal antibodies, which are indistinguishable from 
paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes.

Other  PNDs  are  likely  immune-mediated,  although  their  antigens 
are  unknown.  The  best  example  is  opsoclonus-myoclonus  syndrome 
associated  with  neuroblastoma  or  SCLC.  For  still  other  PNDs,  the 
cause  remains  quite  obscure.  These  include,  among  others,  several 
neuropathies that occur in the terminal stages of cancer and a number 
of  neuropathies  associated  with  plasma  cell  dyscrasias  or  lymphoma 
without evidence of tumor infiltration or deposits of immunoglobulin, 
cryoglobulin, or amyloid.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Paraneoplastic Neurologic Disorders

Three  key  concepts  are  important  for  the  diagnosis  and  manage-
ment of PNDs. First, it is common for symptoms to appear before 
the presence of a tumor is known; second, the neurologic syndrome 
usually develops rapidly, producing severe deficits in a short period 
of  time;  and  third,  there  is  evidence  that  prompt  tumor  control 
improves the neurologic outcome. Therefore, the major concern of 
the physician is to recognize a disorder promptly as paraneoplastic 
and to identify and treat the tumor. 

PND OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND DORSAL ROOT 
GANGLIA
When symptoms involve brain, spinal cord, or dorsal root ganglia, 
the suspicion of PND is usually based on a combination of clinical, 
radiologic, and CSF findings. Presence of antineuronal antibodies

(Tables 94-2 and 94-3) may help in the diagnosis, but only 60–70% 
of  PNDs  of  the  CNS  and  <20%  of  those  involving  the  peripheral 
nervous system have neuronal or neuromuscular junction antibod-
ies that can be used as diagnostic tests.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF studies are impor-
tant to rule out neurologic complications due to the direct spread 
of  cancer,  particularly  metastatic  and  leptomeningeal  disease.  In 
most  PNDs,  the  MRI  findings  are  nonspecific.  Paraneoplastic 
limbic  encephalitis  is  usually  associated  with  characteristic  MRI 
abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobes (see below), but similar 
findings  can  occur  with  other  disorders  (e.g.,  nonparaneoplastic 
autoimmune  limbic  encephalitis  and  human  herpesvirus  type  6 
[HHV-6]  encephalitis)  (Fig.  94-2A).  The  CSF  profile  of  patients 
with  PND  of  the  CNS  or  dorsal  root  ganglia  typically  consists  of 
mild  to  moderate  pleocytosis  (<200  mononuclear  cells,  predomi-
nantly lymphocytes), an increase in the protein concentration, and 
a variable presence of oligoclonal bands. There are no specific elec-
trophysiologic tests that are diagnostic of PND. Moreover, a biopsy 
of the affected tissue is often difficult to obtain, and although useful 
to rule out other disorders (e.g., metastasis), the pathologic findings 
are not specific for PND. 
PND OF NERVE AND MUSCLE
If symptoms involve peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, or 
muscle,  the  diagnosis  of  a  specific  PND  is  usually  established  on 
clinical,  electrophysiologic,  and  pathologic  grounds.  The  clinical 
history, accompanying symptoms (e.g., anorexia, weight loss), and 
type  of  syndrome  dictate  the  studies  and  degree  of  effort  needed 
to  demonstrate  a  neoplasm.  For  example,  the  frequent  associa-
tion  of  Lambert-Eaton  myasthenic  syndrome  (LEMS)  with  SCLC 
should  lead  to  a  chest  and  abdomen  computed  tomography  (CT) 
or body positron emission tomography (PET) scan and, if negative, 
periodic  tumor  screening  for  at  least  3  years  after  the  neurologic 
diagnosis.  In  contrast,  the  weak  association  of  polymyositis  with 
cancer calls into question the need for repeated cancer screenings 
in this situation. Serum and urine immunofixation studies should 
be considered in patients with peripheral neuropathy of unknown 
cause;  detection  of  a  monoclonal  gammopathy  suggests  the  need 
for additional studies to uncover a B-cell or plasma-cell malignancy. 
In paraneoplastic neuropathies, diagnostically useful antineuronal 
antibodies are limited to CRMP5 (CV2) and Hu (ANNA1).

For any type of PND, if antineuronal antibodies are negative, the 
diagnosis relies on the demonstration of cancer and the exclusion 
of other cancer-related or independent neurologic disorders. Com-
bined CT and PET scans often uncover tumors undetected by other 
tests. For germ cell tumors of the testis and teratomas of the ovary, 
ultrasound (testicular, transvaginal, or pelvic) and MRI or CT of the 
abdomen and pelvis may reveal tumors undetectable by PET.

SYNDROMES
 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AND 
FOCAL ENCEPHALITIS WITH ANTIBODIES AGAINST 
INTRACELLULAR NEURONAL PROTEINS
The  term  encephalomyelitis  describes  an  inflammatory  process  with 
multifocal involvement of the nervous system, including brain, brain-
stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. It is often associated with dorsal root 
ganglia and autonomic dysfunction. For any given patient, the clinical 
manifestations  are  determined  by  the  areas  predominantly  involved, 
but pathologic studies almost always reveal abnormalities beyond the 
symptomatic regions. Several clinicopathologic syndromes may occur 
alone or in combination: (1) cortical encephalitis, which may present as 
“epilepsia partialis continua”; (2) limbic encephalitis, characterized by 
confusion,  depression,  agitation,  anxiety,  severe  deficit  forming  new 
memories  (“short-term  memory  deficit”),  and  temporal  lobe  or  gen-
eralized seizures (the MRI usually shows unilateral or bilateral medial 
temporal  lobe  abnormalities,  best  seen  with  T2  and  fluid-attenuated

FIGURE 94-1  Antibody reactivity and pathologic findings in patients with antibodies against intracellular antigens compared with those of patients with antibodies 
against neuronal surface antigens. In encephalitis associated with antibodies against intracellular antigens, the antibodies cannot reach the intracellular epitopes and 
cytotoxic T-cell mechanisms are predominantly involved (A), whereas in encephalitis with antibodies against surface antigens, the antibodies have access to the epitopes 
and can potentially alter the structure and function of the antigen (B). The Hu antibodies (C, E) are shown here to exemplify the group of antibodies against intracellular 
antigens, and the NMDAR antibodies (D, F) are shown to exemplify the group of antibodies against cell-surface antigens. In rodent brain immunofluorescence with tissue 
permeabilized to allow entry of antibodies, the Hu antibodies produce a discrete pattern of cellular immunolabeling (C), whereas the NMDAR antibodies produce a pattern of 
neuropil-like immunolabeling (D). In contrast, with live cultured neurons, only the NMDAR antibodies have access to the target antigen showing intense immunolabeling (F), 
whereas the Hu antibodies cannot reach the intracellular antigen showing no immunolabeling (E). In autopsy studies, patients with encephalitis associated with antibodies 
to intracellular antigens (Hu or other) have extensive neuronal loss and inflammatory infiltrates (not shown); the T cells show direct contact with neurons (arrows in G) likely 
contributing to neuronal degeneration via perforin and granzyme mechanisms (arrow in H). In contrast, patients with antibodies against cell-surface antigens (NMDAR 
shown here, and probably applicable to other antigens) have moderate brain inflammatory infiltrates along with plasma cells (brown cells in I), deposits of IgG (diffuse brown 
staining in J), and microglial proliferation (inset in J), without evidence of predominant T-cell–mediated neuronal loss (not shown). All human tissue sections (G-J) were 
obtained from hippocampus. (From J Dalmau: Antibody mediated encephalitis. N Engl J Med 378:840, 2018. Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society. Reprinted

and limb ataxia; (5) myelitis, which may cause lower or upper motor 

neuron  symptoms,  myoclonus,  muscle  rigidity,  spasms,  sensory  def-

shown in Table 94-2.

Most  types  of  paraneoplastic  encephalitis  and 
encephalomyelitis  in  which  the  antigens  are  intra-
cellular respond poorly to treatment. Stabilization of 
symptoms  or  partial  neurologic  improvement  may 
occur, particularly if there is a satisfactory response 
of the tumor to treatment. Controlled trials of ther-
apy  are  lacking,  but  many  reports  and  the  opinion 
of  experts  suggest  that  therapies  aimed  to  remove 
the  antibodies  against  intracellular  antigens,  such 
as  intravenous  immunoglobulin  (IVIg)  or  plasma 
exchange,  usually  fail.  The  main  concern  should  be 
to  treat  the  tumor  and  consider  immunotherapies 
aimed  at  cytotoxic  T-cell  responses.  Approximately 
30% of patients with anti-Ma2-associated encephali-
tis respond to treatment of the tumor (usually a germ 
cell neoplasm of the testis) and immunotherapy.

 ■ ENCEPHALITIDES WITH 
ANTIBODIES TO CELL-SURFACE OR 
SYNAPTIC PROTEINS (TABLE 94-3)
These  disorders  are  important  for  four  reasons:  (1) 
they can occur with and without tumor association; 
less frequently, they develop after a viral encephalitis 
(herpes  simplex  or  Japanese  encephalitis);  (2)  some 
syndromes  predominate  in  young  individuals  and 
children;  (3)  despite  the  severity  of  the  symptoms, 
patients  usually  respond  to  treatment  of  the  tumor, 
if  found,  and  immunotherapy  (e.g.,  glucocorticoids, 
IVIg,  plasma  exchange,  rituximab,  or  cyclophos-
phamide);  and  (4)  for  many  of  these  disorders,  the 
antibody  pathogenicity  has  been  demonstrated  in 
models using cultures of neurons or passive transfer 
of patients’ antibodies to animals (Fig. 94-3).

studies of patients with several types of autoimmune encephalitides. A. Limbic encephalitis (LE) may 
result from several different immune responses (Hu, Ma2, AMPAR, GABABR, LGI1, Caspr2) and typically 
manifests  with  unilateral  or  bilateral  medial  temporal  lobe  increased  FLAIR  signal.  B.  Anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis often occurs with normal MRI findings or mild FLAIR signal abnormalities. C. In contrast, 
anti-GABAAR  encephalitis  usually  occurs  with  multiple  cortical-subcortical  increased  FLAIR  signal 
changes. D. Cortical encephalitis can occur in patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 
antibodies, as shown in this T2-weighted MRI image from a 3-year-old boy who presented with extensive 
cortical abnormalities with mild enhancement (not shown here) suggesting cortical necrosis. (Panels

hypotension, and central hypoventilation can be the cause of death in 
patients with encephalomyelitis.

Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and focal encephalitis are usually 
associated with SCLC, but many other cancers have been implicated. 
Patients with SCLC and these syndromes usually have Hu antibodies 
in serum and CSF. CRMP5 antibodies occur less frequently; some of 
these patients may develop chorea, uveitis, or optic neuritis. Antibodies 
to Ma proteins are associated with limbic, hypothalamic, and brainstem 
encephalitis and occasionally with cerebellar symptoms; some patients 
develop hypersomnia, cataplexy, and severe hypokinesia. MRI abnor-
malities are frequent, including those described with limbic encepha-
litis  and  variable  involvement  of  the  hypothalamus,  basal  ganglia,  or 
upper brainstem. Kelch-like protein 11 antibodies are predominantly 
associated  with  brainstem  encephalitis  and  seminomas,  germ  cell 
tumors, and teratomas. Amphiphysin antibodies usually are associated 
with paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome, but in some patients, they 
can  occur  with  paraneoplastic  encephalomyelitis  or  isolated  myelitis. 

Encephalitis  with  N-methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA) 
receptor  antibodies  usually  occurs  in  young  women 
and  children,  but  men  and  older  patients  of  both 
sexes can be affected. The disorder has a characteristic 
pattern of symptom progression that often includes a 
prodrome  resembling  a  viral  process,  followed  in  a 
few days by the onset of severe psychiatric symptoms, 
sleep dysfunction (usually insomnia), reduced verbal 
output,  memory  loss,  seizures,  decreased  level  of 
consciousness, abnormal movements (orofacial, limb, 
and trunk dyskinesias, dystonic postures), autonomic 
instability, and frequent hypoventilation. Monosymp-
tomatic  episodes,  such  as  pure  psychosis,  occur 
in  about  5%  of  patients.  Clinical  relapses  occur  in 
12–24% of patients (12% during the first 2 years after 
initial  presentation).  Most  patients  have  intrathecal 
synthesis  of  antibodies,  likely  by  infiltrating  plasma 
cells in brain and meninges (Fig. 94-1I). In about 65% of patients, the 
brain MRI is normal; in the other 35%, it shows FLAIR abnormalities 
that can affect cortical and subcortical regions, usually mild and tran-
sient,  and  rarely  the  presence  of  contrast  enhancement  (Fig.  94-2B). 
The syndrome may be misdiagnosed as a viral or idiopathic enceph-
alitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or encephalitis lethargica, and 
some patients are initially evaluated by psychiatrists with the suspicion 
of acute psychosis as the presentation of a primary psychiatric disease. 
The  detection  of  an  associated  teratoma  is  dependent  on  age  and 
gender: 46% of female patients 12 years or older have uni- or bilateral 
ovarian teratomas, whereas <7% of girls younger than 12 have a ter-
atoma (Fig. 94-4A). In young male patients, the detection of a tumor is 
rare. Patients older than 45 years are more frequently male; about 20% 
of these patients have tumors (e.g., cancer of the breast, ovary, or lung). 
Prompt  diagnosis  and  treatment  with  immunotherapy  (and  tumor 
removal  when  it  applies)  improve  outcome.  Overall,  about  85–90% 
of patients have substantial neurologic improvement or full recovery.

FIGURE 94-3  Proposed mechanisms of disease and functional interactions of autoantibodies with neuronal proteins. The graph shows a multistep process that results 
in antibody-mediated neuronal dysfunction; some of the steps have been demonstrated in reported studies, whereas others are based on proposed hypotheses. Two well-
known triggers of autoimmune encephalitides are represented: herpes simplex encephalitis (A) and systemic tumors (B); the genetic susceptibility of some autoimmune 
encephalitides and unknown immunologic triggers are not depicted. It is postulated that antigens released by viral-induced neuronal destruction or apoptotic tumor cells 
are loaded into antigen-presenting cells (APCs; dendritic cells) and transported to regional lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, naïve B cells exposed to the processed 
antigens, with cooperation of CD4+ T cells, become antigen-experienced and differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells. After entering the brain, memory B cells 
undergo restimulation, antigen-driven affinity maturation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells (C). The contribution of systemically 
produced antibodies to the pool of antibodies present in the brain is unclear and may depend on systemic antibody titers and integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Based 
on experimental models with cultured neurons, the presence of antibodies in the brain may lead to neuronal dysfunction by different mechanisms, including functional 
blocking of the target antigen (GABABR antibodies; D), receptor crosslinking and internalization (NMDAR antibodies; E), and disruption of protein-protein interaction, leading 
to downstream effects on receptors (LGI1 leading to a decrease of Kv1 potassium channels and AMPAR; F). These mechanisms are influenced by the type of antibodies; 
for example, whereas IgG1 antibodies frequently crosslink and internalize the target antigen, IgG4 antibodies are less effective at crosslinking the target and more often 
alter protein-protein interactions. (Panels D-F J Dalmau: Antibody mediated encephalitis. N Engl J Med 378:840, 2018. Copyright © 2018 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Deficits  of  attention,  memory,  and  executive  functions  may  recover 
slowly over many months, sometimes a few years.

Approximately  25%  of  patients  with  herpes  simplex  encephalitis 
develop a form of autoimmune encephalitis that usually is associated 
with  abnormal  movements  (choreoathetosis  after  herpes  simplex 
encephalitis) in children and with cognitive and psychiatric symptoms 
in adults. This disorder develops a few weeks after the viral infection 
has  resolved,  is  associated  with  new  synthesis  of  antibodies  against 
the  NMDA  receptor  and  other  neuronal  cell  surface  proteins,  and  is 
usually less responsive to immunotherapy than anti-NMDA receptor 
encephalitis (idiopathic or teratoma-associated).

Encephalitis  with  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic 
acid  (AMPA)  receptor  antibodies  affects  middle-aged  women,  who 
develop acute limbic dysfunction or, less frequently, prominent psychi-
atric symptoms; 70% of patients have an underlying tumor in the lung, 
breast, or thymus (Fig. 94-4B). In about 50% of cases, the brain MRI 
shows  typical  features  of  limbic  encephalitis  (similar  to  Fig.  94-2A). 
Neurologic relapses may occur; these also respond to immunotherapy 
and are not necessarily associated with tumor recurrence.

Encephalitis  with  GluK2  antibodies  can  affect  children  and  adults 
and  is  associated  with  rapidly  progressive  encephalopathy  with  cere-
bellar ataxia or cerebellitis. Symptoms of encephalopathy may include 
impairment of memory and level of consciousness and motor altera-
tions  such  as  dyskinesias,  choreoathetosis,  bradykinesia,  and  spastic 
paraparesis.  Some  patients  develop  intracranial  hypertension.  In  one 
patient, the symptoms were associated with teratoma.

Encephalitis with γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor anti-
bodies may affect children and adults and is associated with prominent 
seizures  and  status  epilepticus  often  requiring  a  pharmacologically 
induced coma. In approximately 80% of patients, the brain MRI shows 
multifocal, asynchronous, cortical-subcortical T2/FLAIR abnormalities 
predominantly involving temporal and frontal lobes, but also basal gan-
glia and other regions (Fig. 94-2C). Most patients do not have an under-
lying tumor, but some, usually of Japanese ethnicity, may have thymoma.
Encephalitis  with  GABAB  receptor  antibodies  is  usually  associated 
with  limbic  encephalitis  and  seizures.  In  >50%  of  cases,  the  MRI 
shows increased medial temporal lobe FLAIR changes characteristic of 
limbic encephalitis (similar to Fig. 94-2A). In rare instances, patients

develop cerebellar symptoms and opsoclonus. Fifty percent of patients 
have SCLC or a neuroendocrine tumor of the lung. Patients may have 
additional antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which are 
of unclear significance. Other antibodies to nonneuronal proteins are 
often found in these patients as well as in patients with AMPA receptor 
antibodies, indicating a general tendency to autoimmunity.

Encephalitis with glycine receptor (GlyR) antibodies usually manifests 
with a syndrome characterized by progressive encephalomyelitis with 
rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) or stiff-person spectrum of symptoms. 
The disease usually occurs in adults and rarely in children. About 20% 
of adult patients have a concurrent underlying tumor (thymoma, B-cell 
lymphoma, breast or lung cancer) or past history of cancer (thymoma, 
breast, Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma).

Encephalitis with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) anti-
bodies is characterized by nonspecific clinical features of encephalitis 
(confusion,  agitation,  memory  loss,  delusions,  paranoid  ideation, 
hallucinations, psychosis, or seizures) without distinctive MRI changes 
and  frequent  association  with  Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (Ophelia  syn-
drome). The encephalitis is highly responsive to immunotherapy and 
treatment of the tumor.

Encephalitis  with  antibodies  against  dopamine-2  receptor  has  been 
reported in children with basal ganglia encephalitis manifesting with 
abnormal movements (coarse tremor, parkinsonism, chorea, oculogy-
ric crises) along with psychiatric features, lethargy, drowsiness, brain-
stem dysfunction, or ataxia. The disorder is extremely rare and is not 
associated with cancer.

Encephalitis  with  leucine-rich  glioma-inactivated  1  (LGI1)  anti-
bodies  predominates  in  patients  older  than  50  years  (65%  male)  and 
frequently presents with short-term memory loss and seizures (limbic 
encephalopathy), along with hyponatremia and sleep dysfunction. The 
MRI often shows increased FLAIR signal in one or both medial tem-
poral lobes. In about 40% of patients, these symptoms are preceded by 
faciobrachial dystonic seizures, which consist of sudden, short-lasting, 
mainly distal muscle contractions involving the arm, face, or leg. These 
are unilateral but can independently affect both sides and occur multi-
ple times during the day or night. About 15% of patients present with 
rapidly progressive cognitive decline, resembling a rapidly progressive 
dementia.  Less  than  5%  of  patients  have  thymoma.  An  association 
with  the  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  haplotypes  DRB1*07:01, 
DQB1*02:02,  DQA1*02:01,  and  DRB4  has  been  identified  in  non-
paraneoplastic  cases.  All  symptoms,  including  faciobrachial  dystonic 
seizures,  respond  to  immunotherapy,  although  about  two-thirds  of 
patients are left with memory or cognitive deficits.

Encephalitis with contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2) antibod-
ies predominates in patients older than 50 years and is associated with a 
form of encephalitis with three or more of the following core symptoms: 
encephalopathy, cerebellar symptoms, peripheral nervous system hyper-
excitability, dysautonomia, insomnia, neuropathic pain, and weight loss. 
Patients  with  Morvan’s  syndrome,  which  includes  clinical  features  of 
encephalitis (confusion, hallucinations, prominent sleep dysfunction, or 
“agrypnia excitata”), autonomic alterations, and peripheral nerve hyper-
excitability  or  neuromyotonia,  usually  have  Caspr2  antibodies.  About 
20%  of  patients  with  Caspr2  antibody–associated  syndromes  have 
thymoma; this percentage is higher (~40%) in patients with Morvan’s 
syndrome.  An  association  of  Caspr2  antibody–associated  syndromes 
with HLA DRB1*11.01 has been reported.

Encephalitis with dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) antibod-
ies  is  usually  preceded  or  develops  concurrently  with  diarrhea,  other 
gastrointestinal  symptoms,  and  substantial  loss  of  weight  that  often 
suggest  the  presence  of  a  gastrointestinal  disease.  Neurologic  symp-
toms include agitation, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and features 
of  CNS  hyperexcitability  such  as  tremor,  myoclonus,  nystagmus,  sei-
zures, or hyperekplexia. Some patients develop a clinical picture similar 
to progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. The few 
patients reported with an associated tumor all had B-cell neoplasms.

Encephalitis with antibodies against neurexin 3 alpha does not have 
distinctive clinical features; the experience is limited, and the disorder 
does not appear to be associated with cancer.

Anti-IgLON5  disease  is  a  chronic  or  subacute  encephalopathy  that 
characteristically  is  associated  with  rapid  eye  movement  (REM)  and 
non-REM  (NREM)  parasomnia  that  may  be  preceded  or  accompa-
nied  by  bulbar  symptoms,  gait  abnormalities,  movement  disorders 
(chorea,  distal  myoclonus,  tremor,  dystonia,  or  spasms),  oculomotor 
dysfunction,  and,  in  less  than  half  of  cases,  cognitive  decline.  The 
median  age  of  the  patients  is  in  the  early  60s,  and  men  and  women 
are equally affected. The sleep disorder is characterized by abnormal 
sleep  initiation  with  undifferentiated  NREM  sleep  associated  with 
frequent vocalizations and quasi-purposeful movements. Examination 
of the CSF and MRI is unrevealing or demonstrates minor changes of 
unclear clinical relevance. It is not associated with cancer but shows a 
strong association with HLA-DRB1*10:01 and HLA-DQB1*05:01. The 
response  to  immunotherapy  is  poor.  Neuropathologic  studies  often 
show a neuronal tauopathy predominantly involving the hypothalamus 
and tegmentum of the brainstem.

With  the  exception  of  patients  with  anti-IgLON5  disease,  who 
rarely  respond  to  treatment,  most  patients  with  autoimmune  or

paraneoplastic  encephalopathies  associated  with  antibodies  against 
cell-surface  or  synaptic  proteins  respond  to  immunotherapy  and 
treatment of the tumor (if appropriate). Although there are no specific 
standardized treatment protocols, the most frequent approach consists 
of progressive escalation of immunotherapy using first a combination 
of glucocorticoids, IVIg, and plasma exchange, and then, if there is no 
response, rituximab or cyclophosphamide.

Encephalitis  with  myelin  oligodendrocyte  glycoprotein  (MOG)  anti-
bodies  can  present  with  a  clinical  picture  suggestive  of  autoimmune 
encephalitis related to neuronal antibodies. Most patients with MOG 
antibody–associated  syndromes  are  children  and  young  adults  who 
present  with  optic  neuritis,  myelitis,  or  acute  disseminated  enceph-
alomyelitis  (ADEM).  About  85%  of  patients  with  these  syndromes 
respond to immunotherapy, although relapses occur in about 30% of 
cases.  Besides  these  syndromes,  there  is  a  small  group  of  adults  and 
children that present with unilateral or bilateral cortical encephalitis, 
and  their  response  to  treatment  is  variable.  In  children,  two  pheno-
types  of  poor  prognosis  include  ADEM-like  relapses  progressing  to  
leukodystrophy-like features and extensive cortical encephalitis evolv-
ing to atrophy (Fig. 94-2D). In general, MOG antibody syndromes are 
not associated with tumors.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC CEREBELLAR DEGENERATION
This disorder is often preceded by a prodrome that may include dizzi-
ness, oscillopsia, blurry or double vision, nausea, and vomiting. A few 
days or weeks later, patients develop dysarthria, gait and limb ataxia, 
and variable dysphagia. The examination usually shows downbeating 
nystagmus  and,  rarely,  opsoclonus.  Brainstem  dysfunction,  upgoing 
toes, or a mild neuropathy may occur. Early in the course, MRI studies 
are usually normal; later, the MRI reveals cerebellar atrophy. The disor-
der results from extensive degeneration of Purkinje cells, with variable 
involvement of other cerebellar cortical neurons, deep cerebellar nuclei, 
and  spinocerebellar  tracts.  The  tumors  more  frequently  involved  are 
SCLC, cancer of the breast and ovary, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Anti-Yo  (PCA1)  antibodies  in  patients  with  breast  or  gynecologic 
cancers  typically  are  associated  with  prominent  or  pure  cerebellar 
degeneration. A variable degree of cerebellar dysfunction can be asso-
ciated with virtually any of the antibodies and PND of the CNS shown 
in Table 94-2. A number of single case reports have described neuro-
logic improvement after tumor removal, plasma exchange, IVIg, cyclo-
phosphamide,  rituximab,  or  glucocorticoids.  However,  most  patients 
with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and any of the antibodies 
shown in Table 94-2 do not improve with treatment.

A cerebellar syndrome can also occur with antibodies against cell-
surface or synaptic proteins, including P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium 
channels  (VGCC),  Tr  (DNER),  mGluR2,  or  Sez6l2  (Table  94-3).  The 
frequency and type of tumor association vary with the type of antibody. 
The cerebellar syndrome of patients with mGluR1 antibodies is highly 
responsive  to  treatment  of  the  tumor  and  immunotherapy,  whereas 
the syndrome of patients with Tr or VGCC antibodies is less treatment 
responsive. The experience with mGluR2 and Sez6l2 is limited to a few 
patients, but mGluR2 antibody–associated cerebellar symptoms seem 
to be highly responsive to treatment. Patients with GluK2 antibodies 
can present with cerebellitis and posterior fossa edema with compres-
sion  of  the  4th  ventricle;  the  syndrome  is  potentially  treatable  with 
immunotherapy.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC OPSOCLONUS-MYOCLONUS 
SYNDROME
Opsoclonus is a disorder of eye movement characterized by involuntary, 
chaotic  saccades  that  occur  in  all  directions  of  gaze;  it  is  frequently 
associated  with  myoclonus  and  ataxia.  Opsoclonus-myoclonus  may 
be cancer-related or idiopathic. When the cause is paraneoplastic, the 
tumors  involved  are  usually  cancer  of  the  lung  and  breast  in  adults, 
neuroblastoma  in  children,  and  ovarian  teratoma  in  adolescents  and 
young  women.  The  pathologic  substrate  of  opsoclonus-myoclonus  is 
unclear,  but  studies  suggest  that  disinhibition  of  the  fastigial  nucleus 
of  the  cerebellum  is  involved.  Most  patients  do  not  have  antineu-
ronal  antibodies.  A  small  subset  of  patients  with  ataxia,  opsoclonus, 

and  other  eye-movement  disorders  develop  Ri  antibodies;  these 
patients  may  also  develop  muscle  rigidity,  laryngeal  spasms,  and 
autonomic dysfunction. The tumors most frequently involved in anti- 
Ri-associated  syndromes  are  breast,  ovarian,  and  lung  cancers.  If  the 
tumor  is  not  successfully  treated,  the  syndrome  in  adults  often  pro-
gresses to encephalopathy, coma, and death. In addition to treating the 
tumor,  symptoms  may  respond  to  immunotherapy  (glucocorticoids, 
plasma exchange, and/or IVIg).

At  least  50%  of  children  with  opsoclonus-myoclonus  have  an 
underlying neuroblastoma. Hypotonia, ataxia, behavioral changes, and 
irritability  are  frequent  accompanying  symptoms.  Neurologic  symp-
toms often improve with treatment of the tumor and glucocorticoids, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), plasma exchange, IVIg, ritux-
imab, or cyclophosphamide. Many patients are left with psychomotor 
retardation and behavioral and sleep problems.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES OF THE SPINAL 
CORD
The number of reports of paraneoplastic spinal cord syndromes, such 
as  subacute  motor  neuronopathy  and  acute  necrotizing  myelopathy, 
has  decreased  in  recent  years.  This  may  represent  a  true  decrease  in 
incidence,  due  to  improved  and  prompt  oncologic  interventions,  or 
the identification of nonparaneoplastic etiologies. Some patients with 
cancer or lymphoma develop upper or lower motor neuron dysfunction 
or both, resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is unclear whether 
these disorders have a paraneoplastic etiology or simply coincide with 
the presence of cancer.

Paraneoplastic myelitis may present with upper or lower motor neu-
ron symptoms, segmental myoclonus, sensory deficits, sphincter dys-
function, and neurogenic pruritus and can be the first manifestation of 
encephalomyelitis. The spine MRI usually shows longitudinally exten-
sive, symmetric tract or gray matter abnormalities in the spinal cord. It 
is mainly associated with breast and lung carcinomas and with CRMP5 
or amphiphysin antibodies. The prognosis is poor. Neuromyelitis optica 
(NMO) with aquaporin 4 antibodies may occur in rare instances as a 
paraneoplastic manifestation of a cancer. NMO is discussed in detail 
in Chap. 445.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME
This  disorder  is  characterized  by  progressive  muscle  rigidity,  stiff-
ness, and painful spasms triggered by auditory, sensory, or emotional 
stimuli. Rigidity mainly involves the lower trunk and legs, but it can 
affect the upper extremities and neck. Sometimes, only one extremity 
is  affected  (stiff-limb  syndrome).  Symptoms  improve  with  sleep  and 
general anesthetics. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrate continuous 
motor  unit  activity.  The  associated  antibodies  target  proteins  (GAD, 
amphiphysin)  involved  in  the  function  of  inhibitory  synapses  using 
γ-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  or  glycine  as  neurotransmitters.  The 
presence of amphiphysin antibodies usually indicates a paraneoplastic 
etiology related to SCLC and breast cancer. By contrast, GAD antibod-
ies may occur in some cancer patients but are much more frequently 
present in the nonparaneoplastic disorder. GlyR antibodies may occur 
in some patients with stiff-person syndrome; these antibodies are more 
frequently detectable in patients with PERM (Fig. 94-5).

Optimal  treatment  of  stiff-person  syndrome  requires  therapy  of 
the underlying tumor, glucocorticoids, and symptomatic use of drugs 
that  enhance  GABA-ergic  transmission  (diazepam,  baclofen,  sodium 
valproate, tiagabine, vigabatrin). IVIg and plasma exchange are tran-
siently effective in some patients, and there are reports of responses to 
rituximab in patients who did not respond to other treatments.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC SENSORY NEURONOPATHY OR 
DORSAL ROOT GANGLIONOPATHY
This  syndrome  is  characterized  by  sensory  deficits  that  may  be 
symmetric  or  asymmetric,  painful  dysesthesias,  radicular  pain,  and 
decreased or absent reflexes. All modalities of sensation and any part 
of the body including face and trunk can be involved. Special senses 
such as taste and hearing can also be affected. Electrophysiologic stud-
ies show decreased or absent sensory nerve potentials with normal or

FIGURE 94-5  Schematic representation of an inhibitory synapse showing the main autoimmune targets (GAD, amphiphysin, GABA receptor, and glycine receptor) and 
the  corresponding  neurologic  disorders.  GAD  antibodies  predominantly  occur  in  stiff-person  syndrome  (SPS),  cerebellar  ataxia,  and  epilepsy,  sometimes  in  the  setting 
of encephalitis. Amphiphysin antibodies are markers of paraneoplastic SPS and breast cancer, GlyR antibodies often associate with progressive encephalomyelitis with 
rigidity  and  myoclonus  (PERM),  and  GABAA  receptor  antibodies  occur  in  a  form  of  autoimmune  encephalitis  that  is  frequently  associated  with  refractory  seizures  and  
status epilepticus. (Modified from F Graus et al: Nat Rev Neurol 16:353, 2020.)

near-normal  motor  conduction  velocities.  Symptoms  result  from  an 
inflammatory, likely immune-mediated, process that targets the dorsal 
root ganglia, causing neuronal loss and secondary degeneration of the 
posterior columns of the spinal cord. The dorsal and, less frequently, 
the anterior nerve roots and peripheral nerves may also be involved. 
This  disorder  often  precedes  or  is  associated  with  encephalomyelitis 
and autonomic dysfunction and has the same immunologic and onco-
logic associations (Hu antibodies, SCLC).

As  with  anti-Hu-associated  encephalomyelitis,  the  therapeutic 
approach  focuses  on  prompt  treatment  of  the  tumor  and  cytotoxic 
T-cell–mediated  mechanisms.  Glucocorticoids  occasionally  produce 
clinical stabilization or improvement. The benefit of IVIg and plasma 
exchange is not proven.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES
These  disorders  may  develop  any  time  during  the  course  of  the  neo-
plastic  disease.  Neuropathies  occurring  at  late  stages  of  cancer  or 
lymphoma usually cause mild to moderate sensorimotor deficits due to 
axonal degeneration of unclear etiology. These neuropathies are often 
masked  by  concurrent  neurotoxicity  from  chemotherapy  and  other 
cancer therapies. In contrast, the neuropathies that develop in the early 
stages of cancer frequently show a rapid progression, sometimes with a 
relapsing and remitting course, and evidence of inflammatory infiltrates 
and  axonal  loss  or  demyelination.  If  demyelinating  features  predomi-
nate (Chaps. 446 and 447), IVIg, plasma exchange, or glucocorticoids 
may improve symptoms. Occasionally, CRMP5 antibodies are present; 
detection of anti-Hu suggests concurrent dorsal root ganglionitis.

Guillain-Barré  syndrome  (Chap.  447)  and  brachial  plexitis  
(Chap.  446)  have  occasionally  been  reported  in  patients  with 

Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but there is no clear evidence of a paraneoplas-
tic association.

Diseases  associated  with  monoclonal  gammopathies  such  as  multi-
ple  myeloma,  osteosclerotic  myeloma,  cryoglobulinemia,  amyloido-
sis,  Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia,  or  POEMS  (polyneuropathy, 
organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein spike, and skin manifesta-
tions) syndrome, among others, may cause neuropathy by a variety of 
mechanisms, including compression of roots and plexuses by metasta-
sis to vertebral bodies and pelvis, by deposits of amyloid in peripheral 
nerves, or through a direct interaction of the abnormal immunoglob-
ulin with peripheral nerve antigens. In other patients, the mechanisms 
underlying  the  neuropathy  remain  unknown  and  paraneoplastic 
immune-mediated mechanisms have not been ruled out. Neuropathies 
more often occur with IgM gammopathies followed by IgG and IgA. 
The phenotype of the neuropathy and likelihood of improvement with 
successful treatment of the gammopathy are dependent on the under-
lying hematologic disorder (Chap. 447).

Vasculitis  of  the  nerve  and  muscle  causes  a  painful  symmetric  or 
asymmetric distal axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with variable prox-
imal weakness. It predominantly affects elderly men and is associated 
with  an  elevated  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  and  increased  CSF 
protein  concentration.  SCLC  and  lymphoma  are  the  primary  tumors 
involved. Glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide often result in neu-
rologic improvement.

Peripheral  nerve  hyperexcitability  (neuromyotonia,  or  Isaacs’  syn-
drome) is characterized by spontaneous and continuous muscle fiber 
activity  of  peripheral  nerve  origin.  Clinical  features  include  cramps, 
muscle  twitching  (fasciculations  or  myokymia),  stiffness,  delayed 
muscle  relaxation  (pseudomyotonia),  and  spontaneous  or  evoked

carpal  or  pedal  spasms.  The  involved  muscles  may  be  hypertrophic, 
and  some  patients  develop  paresthesias  and  hyperhidrosis.  The  elec-
tromyogram  (EMG)  shows  fibrillations;  fasciculations;  and  doublet, 
triplet, or multiplet single-unit (myokymic) discharges that have a high 
intraburst frequency. Some patients have Caspr2 antibodies usually in 
the context of Morvan’s syndrome, but most patients with isolated neu-
romyotonia are antibody negative. The disorder often occurs without 
cancer; if paraneoplastic, benign and malignant thymomas and SCLC 
are the usual tumors. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and plasma exchange 
improve symptoms.

Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy usually develops as a compo-
nent of other disorders, such as LEMS and encephalomyelitis. It may 
rarely  occur  as  a  pure  or  predominantly  autonomic  neuropathy  with 
cholinergic  or  adrenergic  dysfunction  at  the  pre-  or  postganglionic 
levels. Patients can develop several life-threatening complications, such 
as gastrointestinal paresis with pseudo-obstruction, cardiac dysrhyth-
mias, and postural hypotension. Other clinical features include abnor-
mal pupillary responses, dry mouth, anhidrosis, erectile dysfunction, 
and problems in sphincter control. The disorder occurs in association 
with several tumors, including SCLC, cancer of the pancreas or testis, 
carcinoid tumors, and lymphoma. Because autonomic symptoms can 
be the presenting feature of encephalomyelitis, serum Hu and CRMP5 
antibodies should be sought. Antibodies to ganglionic (α3-type) neu-
ronal acetylcholine receptors are the cause of autoimmune autonomic 
ganglionopathy, a disorder that frequently occurs without cancer asso-
ciation (Chap. 440).

 ■ LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME
LEMS is discussed in Chap. 448.

 ■ MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
Myasthenia gravis is discussed in Chap. 448.
 ■ POLYMYOSITIS-DERMATOMYOSITIS
Polymyositis  and  dermatomyositis  are  discussed  in  detail  in  
Chap. 365.

 ■ IMMUNE-MEDIATED NECROTIZING MYOPATHY
Patients  with  this  syndrome  develop  myalgias  and  rapid  progression 
of  weakness  involving  the  extremities,  neck,  pharyngeal,  respiratory, 
and sometimes cardiac muscles. Serum muscle enzymes are elevated, 
and  muscle  biopsy  shows  extensive  necrosis  with  minimal  or  absent 
inflammation  and  sometimes  deposits  of  complement.  The  disorder 
may occur without cancer association (sometimes as a result of statin 
exposure,  connective  tissue  disease,  or  HIV)  or  with  cancer  associ-
ation.  Patients  with  antibodies  against  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and seronegative patients are more 
likely to have an underlying cancer than those with antibodies against 
signal recognition particle. No specific type of cancer has been found 
to be predominant. Successful treatment of the tumor and aggressive 
immunotherapy  (steroids,  IVIg,  and  steroid-sparing  immunosup-
pressants)  may  lead  to  complete  or  substantial  recovery.  Immune- 
mediated necrotizing myopathy is discussed in Chap. 365.

 ■ PARANEOPLASTIC VISUAL SYNDROMES
This  group  of  disorders  involves  the  retina  and,  less  frequently,  the 
uvea and optic nerves. The term cancer-associated retinopathy is used 
to describe paraneoplastic cone and rod dysfunction characterized by 
photosensitivity, progressive loss of vision and color perception, central 
or  ring  scotomas,  night  blindness,  and  attenuation  of  photopic  and 
scotopic  responses  in  the  electroretinogram  (ERG).  The  most  com-
monly  associated  tumor  is  SCLC.  Melanoma-associated  retinopathy 
affects patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Patients develop 
acute onset of night blindness and shimmering, flickering, or pulsating 
photopsias that often progress to visual loss. The ERG shows reduced 
b-waves with normal dark adapted a-waves. Paraneoplastic optic neu-
ritis  and  uveitis  can  develop  in  association  with  encephalomyelitis. 
Patients  with  paraneoplastic  uveitis  and  optic  neuritis  may  harbor 
CRMP5 antibodies.

Some paraneoplastic retinopathies are associated with serum anti-
bodies  that  specifically  react  with  the  subset  of  retinal  cells  under-
going  degeneration,  supporting  an  immune-mediated  pathogenesis  
(Table  94-2).  Paraneoplastic  retinopathies  rarely  show  substantial 
improvement after treatment of the tumor and immunotherapy; how-
ever,  stabilization  of  symptoms  and  partial  responses  to  a  variety  of 
immunotherapies (glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, IVIg, rituximab, 
or alemtuzumab) have been reported.

95 Cancer Survivorship  

and the Long-Term Impact  
of Cancer and Its Treatment
Mark Roschewski, Dan L. Longo

The  impact  of  cancer  extends  well  past  initial  diagnosis.  Patients 
are  significantly  affected  by  cancer  and  treatment-related  toxicities 
often  extending  beyond  the  initial  treatment  period.  Adult  survivors 
of  childhood,  adolescent,  and  young  adult  cancer  face  special  health 
consequences  of  cancer  treatment  related  to  premature  physiologic 
aging  and  frailty.  More  than  40%  of  these  patients  will  experience  a 
severe, disabling, or life-threatening condition or die of a chronic con-
dition. Long-term effects include toxicities that emerge during therapy 
and  continue  beyond  treatment,  while  late  effects  include  toxicities 
that may not emerge for months or years after treatment. Significant 
improvements in cancer treatments have enabled more people to sur-
vive once-deadly diseases, leading to more cancer survivors subjected 
to the potential long-term impact of cancer treatment (Table 95-1 lists 
potential long-term and late effects of cancer therapy by organ system). 
The direct causality of emerging treatments may not be immediately 
evident, and pharmacovigilance remains critical after treatments first 
become approved.

In the United States, the number of cancer survivors may increase 
from 17 million to nearly 26 million by the year 2040, and the number 
of patients who survive at least 5 years after initial diagnosis is expected 
to increase by 35% over the next decade. Improvements in cancer treat-
ments for children and adolescents have led to modern 5-year survival 
rates  of  approximately  80%  or  greater.  Despite  the  magnitude  of  the 
growing problem, the core issues related to cancer survivorship remain 
understudied and the research is often concentrated in highly preva-
lent cancers. Most studies are observational and descriptive with fewer 
studies  focused  on  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  complications. 
Cancer survivorship remains an area that is ripe for further discovery; 
a  deeper  understanding  of  the  biological  basis  and/or  the  influence 
of  genetics  on  host  susceptibility  and  the  long-term  effects  of  cancer 
therapy is needed.

Our  primary  understanding  of  the  long-term  impact  of  cancer 
treatment  originated  from  survivors  of  childhood  malignancies  who 
are often cured after treatment with a combination of chemotherapy, 
radiation, and surgery. Treatment paradigms for cancer continuously 
evolve, however, and newer treatments including targeted agents and 
immunotherapy have introduced unique long-term effects, particularly 
when  these  agents  are  administered  indefinitely  (Table 95-2  lists  the 
potential  long-term  effects  of  specific  cancer  treatments).  Improve-
ments in the tolerability of cancer therapy and in supportive care have 
allowed  a  greater  number  of  patients  with  comorbid  conditions  and 
advanced  age  to  receive  treatment,  which  has  increased  the  rate  of

chronic morbidity. Approximately 60% of current cancer survivors are 
older than age 65. Indeed, the cause-specific mortality following initial 
treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma includes nearly 40% of deaths attrib-
uted  to  nonlymphoma  causes.  Indeed,  more  patients  diagnosed  with  
Hodgkin lymphoma die from treatment-related late toxicity than from 
Hodgkin lymphoma. Individuals aged 60–74 have a disproportionate 
excess of deaths related to heart disease, lung disease, infections, and 
adverse effects of drugs. The complexities of cancer survivorship and 
the importance of longitudinal care of cancer patients are recognized 
as vital components to comprehensive cancer care, and model systems 
have  been  specifically  developed  for  this  purpose.  Still,  the  primary 
goal  of  cancer  therapy  remains  long-term  disease  control,  and  the 
treating physician must maintain proper perspective when considering 
these  relative  risks.  The  fear  of  long-term  complications  should  not 
prevent the application of effective cancer treatment, particularly when 
delivered with curative intent. In a sense, managing long-term effects is 
a privilege only afforded those fortunate enough to overcome the initial 
threat to life represented by the cancer diagnosis.

CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION
The excess risks of cardiovascular disease after anthracycline chemo-
therapy and radiation that involves the mediastinum are well charac-
terized  and  include  arrhythmias,  cardiac  ischemia,  congestive  heart 
failure (CHF), pericardial disease, myocarditis, and peripheral vascular 
disease.  It  is  estimated  that  one  in  eight  childhood  cancer  survivors 
will experience a life-threatening cardiovascular event within 30 years 
after initial exposure, and cardiovascular disease is the most common 
cause  of  noncancer  death  in  this  population.  Newer  targeted  agents 
and  immunotherapy  have  introduced  additional  cardiovascular  risks 
that extend into older populations as well. A new discipline of cardio- 
oncology has been developed to better characterize individuals at high 
risk for treatment-related cardiac toxicities, develop surveillance strat-
egies, and improve the management of long-term effects.

Radiation  therapy  that  includes  the  heart  can  cause  interstitial 
myocardial  fibrosis,  acute  and  chronic  pericarditis,  valvular  disease, 
and  accelerated  premature  atherosclerotic  coronary  artery  disease. 
Repeated  or  high  (>6000  cGy)  radiation  doses  are  associated  with 
greater risk, as is concomitant cardiotoxic cancer chemotherapy expo-
sure. Symptoms of acute pericarditis peak about 9 months after treat-
ment and include dyspnea, chest pain, and fever. Chronic constrictive 
pericarditis may develop 5–10 years following radiation therapy. Car-
diac valvular disease includes aortic insufficiency from fibrosis or pap-
illary  muscle  dysfunction  resulting  in  mitral  regurgitation.  Extensive 
radiation fields are associated with accelerated coronary artery disease 
and peripheral vascular disease and a markedly increased risk of fatal 
myocardial  infarction  or  thromboembolic  stroke.  Three-dimensional 
conformal techniques and newer particles including proton beams may 
more precisely target the tumor and spare normal tissue, but these are 
not widely available and the degree to which they will decrease long-
term cardiovascular effects is unknown. In recognition of the risks of 
radiation, careful planning procedures are performed before treatment 
designed to limit the field of radiation to the greatest extent possible.

The myocardial toxicity of anthracyclines is dose-dependent and is 
associated with the pathognomonic finding of myofibrillar dropout on 
endomyocardial  biopsy.  Anthracycline  cardiotoxicity  occurs  through 
a root mechanism of chemical free radical damage. Fe3+-doxorubicin 
complexes  damage  DNA,  nuclear  and  cytoplasmic  membranes,  and 
mitochondria. These cardiotoxic effects may also be mediated by topoi-
somerase IIB. Approximately 5% of patients receiving >450–550 mg/m2 
total dose of doxorubicin will develop CHF, but it can also develop at 
substantially lower doses in some patients. Anthracycline-related CHF 
is often irreversible and carries a high mortality rate, making preven-
tion crucial. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple 
genetic polymorphisms associated with a higher risk of cardiotoxicity, 
but  our  ability  to  risk-stratify  is  limited.  The  risk  of  cardiac  failure 
appears to be related to the route of administration, and regimens that 
use  continuous  infusion  of  doxorubicin  or  liposomally  encapsulated 
doxorubicin  are  associated  with  less  cardiotoxicity.  Baseline  assess-
ment of cardiac function with multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or

transthoracic echocardiograms is commonly performed, and a patient 
who develops symptoms suggestive of CHF should be tested immedi-

is often done in asymptomatic patients with preexisting risk factors.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) that is also associated with CHF. It is 
used in combination with chemotherapy as both adjuvant therapy and 
as treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and it is sometimes combined 

with anthracyclines, which is believed to result in additive or possibly 
synergistic toxicity. In contrast to anthracyclines, cardiotoxicity is not 
dose  related,  is  usually  reversible,  is  not  associated  with  pathologic 
changes on cardiac myofibrils, and has a different biochemical mech-
anism  inhibiting  intrinsic  cardiac  repair  mechanisms.  Monitoring 
for  cardiac  toxicity  is  typically  performed  every  three  or  four  doses 
using  functional  cardiac  testing,  and  treatment  is  interrupted  when 
ejection fractions significantly decline from baseline. Other potentially

cardiotoxic  chemotherapy  agents  include  phosphoramide  mustards 
(cyclophosphamide) at high doses and ifosfamide.

Small-molecule  inhibitors,  including  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors, 
are  novel  classes  of  molecularly  targeted  anticancer  agents  that  have 
become routinely applicable across a variety of malignancies. Although 
the overall tolerability of these drugs is often better than chemother-
apy,  they  are  frequently  administered  indefinitely,  which  introduces 
new notions of cumulative long-term effects. These agents also carry 
risks of cardiovascular toxicities including CHF, atrial and ventricular 
arrhythmias,  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval,  and  pulmonary  and 
systemic hypertension. New anticancer agents often become available 
for  use  on  accelerated  approvals  before  a  full  understanding  of  the 
long-term toxicity profile is known. Two illustrative examples of this 
are  lapatinib  and  ponatinib,  which  both  had  their  approvals  updated 
with  black  box  cardiovascular  toxicity  warnings  a  median  of  4  years 
after initial drug approval. Other small-molecule inhibitors that have 
been  associated  with  CHF  include  bosutinib,  dasatinib,  nilotinib, 
pazopanib,  axitinib,  trametinib,  sunitinib,  carfilzomib,  and  sorafenib. 
Systemic  hypertension  is  commonly  associated  with  agents  targeting 
vascular endothelial growth factor or its receptors (e.g., bevacizumab, 
cabozantinib, lenvatinib, nintedanib), ponatinib (an Abl inhibitor), and 
trametinib (a MEK inhibitor), whereas dasatinib (an Abl inhibitor) has 
a well-documented association with pulmonary hypertension. Ibruti-
nib (a BTK inhibitor) has been associated with atrial fibrillation as well 
as ventricular arrythmias. As more of these small-molecule inhibitors 
become  approved  for  use  and  their  indications  broaden,  additional 
monitoring for long-term and late effects should be incorporated into 
the routine surveillance of oncologists, cardiologists, and primary care 
providers.

Immunotherapy  agents  have  also  emerged  as  effective  anticancer 
therapies that have substantially improved clinical outcomes in a vari-
ety  of  cancers.  Immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  have  been  associated 
with  a  number  of  important  cardiovascular  toxicities  including  peri-
cardial disease, vasculitis, and fulminant myocarditis. The mechanism 
of these toxicities is T cell mediated, and the toxicities often respond to 
early institution of glucocorticoids, but they can be severe or fatal if not 
recognized  promptly.  Combinations  of  multiple  immune  checkpoint 
inhibitors increase the risk of these immune-related toxicities, and no 
clear pattern of which patients are most susceptible has emerged. Chi-
meric  antigen  receptor  T-cell  (CAR-T)  therapies  are  associated  with 
cytokine release syndromes (CRS), which can be severe and associated 
with arrhythmias or decompensated heart failure. Interleukin 6 recep-
tor blockers may decrease these risks, and supportive care guidelines 
recommend early institution of these agents in severe CRS.

The  management  of  treatment-associated  cardiovascular  disease 
is  essentially  the  same  as  for  cardiac  disease  unrelated  to  cancer 
treatment.  Discontinuation  of  the  offending  agent  is  the  first  step. 
Diuretics, fluid and sodium restriction, and antiarrhythmic agents are 
often useful for acute symptoms. Afterload reduction with angiotensin-
converting  enzyme  inhibitors  or  β-adrenergic  blockers  may  improve 
systolic  function  over  time,  and  digitalis  may  improve  symptoms. 
Routine  screening  for  asymptomatic  systolic  dysfunction  is  currently 
recommended for survivors at high risk for cardiomyopathy including 
those  with  an  anthracycline  exposure  ≥250  mg/m2,  ≥35  Gy  of  chest 
radiation, or combined therapy with both anthracyclines and radiation. 
Echocardiography  is  the  recommended  screening  modality,  and  sur-
veillance should begin no later than 2 years after exposure and should 
be repeated a minimum of every 5 years thereafter.

PULMONARY DYSFUNCTION
Radiation-induced lung injury presents in early phases as acute pneu-
monitis at 4 weeks following treatment, but it can evolve into pulmo-
nary  fibrosis  in  late  phases.  Risk  factors  for  radiation  pneumonitis 
include advanced age, smoking, poor performance status, preexisting 
compromised  pulmonary  function,  and  radiation  volume  and  dose. 
It  occurs  most  commonly  in  patients  with  lung  cancer,  mediastinal 
lymphoma,  and  breast  cancer,  and  the  incidence  is  decreasing  due 
to advances in radiation delivery techniques. The dose “threshold” is 
thought  to  be  in  the  range  of  5–20  Gy.  Hypoxemia  and  dyspnea  on

exertion are characteristic, and the severity of symptoms may be out of 
proportion to the lung volume irradiated. Fine, high-pitched “Velcro 
rales” may be an accompanying physical finding, and fever, cough, and 
pleuritic  chest  pain  are  common  symptoms.  The  diffusion  capacity 
of the lungs for carbon dioxide (DlCO) is the most sensitive measure 
of  pulmonary  functional  impairment,  and  ground-glass  infiltrates 
often correspond with relatively sharp edges to the irradiated volume, 
although  the  pneumonitis  may  progress  beyond  the  field  and  even 
occasionally  involve  the  contralateral  unirradiated  lung.  The  mecha-
nism of lung injury is a direct effect of radiation that leads to increased 
capillary  permeability  and  pulmonary  edema.  Damage  to  type  I  and 
II pneumocytes leads to surfactant loss and the transudation of serum 
proteins into the alveoli. Cytokines including tumor necrosis factor α 
are released from the damaged lung cells and attract inflammatory cells 
to the alveoli and interstitial space. The late phases of injury are caused 
by reactive oxygen species that stimulate collagen production and lead 
to  fibrosis  but  do  not  occur  in  all  cases.  Transforming  growth  factor 
β (TGF-β) is particularly important in stimulating collagen synthesis 
and may represent a therapeutic target to prevent pulmonary fibrosis.
Bleomycin  generates  activated  free  radical  oxygen  species  and 
causes  pneumonitis  associated  with  a  radiographic  or  interstitial 
ground-glass appearance diffusely throughout both lungs, often worse 
in the lower lobes. A nonproductive cough with or without fever may 
be  an  early  sign.  This  toxicity  is  dose-related  and  dose-limiting.  The 
DlCO  is  a  sensitive  measure  of  toxicity  and  recovery,  and  a  baseline 
value is generally obtained for future comparison before administering 
bleomycin therapy. Doses are reduced or stopped if the baseline DlCO 
falls  25%  or  more.  Additive  or  synergistic  risk  factors  include  age, 
prior lung disease, and concomitant use of other chemotherapy, lung 
irradiation, and high concentrations of inspired oxygen. Other chemo-
therapeutic agents notable for pulmonary toxicity include mitomycin, 
nitrosoureas, doxorubicin with radiation, gemcitabine combined with 
weekly docetaxel, methotrexate, and fludarabine. High-dose alkylating 
agents,  cyclophosphamide,  ifosfamide,  and  melphalan  are  frequently 
used  in  the  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  setting,  often  with 
whole-body  radiation.  This  therapy  may  result  in  severe  pulmonary 
fibrosis and/or pulmonary venoocclusive disease.

Radiation-induced  lung  injury  and  chemotherapy-induced  pneu-
monitis  are  generally  glucocorticoid  responsive,  except  in  the  case 
of  nitrosoureas.  Prednisone  1  mg/kg  is  often  used  to  control  acute 
symptoms and prevent pulmonary dysfunction with a slow taper over 
12  weeks.  Prolonged  glucocorticoid  therapy  requires  gastrointestinal 
protection  with  proton  pump  inhibitors,  management  of  hyperglyce-
mia,  heightened  infection  management,  and  prevention  or  treatment 
of  steroid-induced  osteoporosis.  Antibiotics,  bronchodilators,  oxygen 
in only lowest necessary doses, and diuretics may all play an important 
role  in  management  of  pneumonitis,  and  consultation  with  a  pul-
monologist should be routinely undertaken. Relapses can occur after 
an initial response to glucocorticoids and may respond to agents such 
as azathioprine or cyclosporine. Amifostine is a free radical scavenger 
and  radioprotective  agent  that  reduces  the  rate  of  pneumonitis,  but 
it is associated with severe nausea and hypotension that limit its use. 
No effective therapy exists for pulmonary fibrosis, and the treatment 
is  primarily  supportive  with  supplemental  oxygen.  Targeted  anti- 
inflammatory agents are being tested to reduce the incidence of pulmo-
nary fibrosis, but they remain experimental.

Pulmonary  toxicity  resulting  from  targeted  anticancer  agents 
including  small-molecule  inhibitors  and  immunotherapy  agents  is 
uncommon  but  can  be  potentially  life-threatening  and  often  lead  to 
drug  discontinuation.  Noninfectious  pneumonitis  is  associated  with 
cough, dyspnea, and infiltrates on chest imaging and has been reported 
to  be  associated  with  sunitinib,  sorafenib,  epidermal  growth  factor 
receptor  (EGFR)  inhibitors  (cetuximab,  afatinib),  crizotinib  (ALK 
inhibitor),  phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)  inhibitors  (idelalisib, 
copanlisib),  and  mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  inhibitors 
(everolimus,  temsirolimus).  The  antibody-drug  conjugate  brentuxi-
mab vedotin may also cause severe pulmonary toxicity when used in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents, particularly bleomycin. 
The onset of drug-induced pneumonitis can be rapid, and prompt use

of  glucocorticoids  is  important  once  infectious  causes  are  excluded. 
Severe pneumonitis is typically a reason to discontinue the offending 
drug permanently.

IMMUNE SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION
A significant risk of most anticancer treatment is hematologic toxicity 
with cumulative effects on the host immune system leading to a higher 
risk of second malignancies and impaired long-term immune health. 
Second  malignancies  in  cancer  survivors  are  a  major  cause  of  death, 
and  survivors  of  childhood  cancers  have  a  twofold  increased  risk 
of  solid  tumors  beyond  the  age  of  40  years  compared  to  the  general 
population. The induction of second malignancies is governed by the 
complex  interplay  of  age,  sex,  environmental  exposures,  genetic  sus-
ceptibility, and specific cancer treatments. Often, the events that led to 
the primary cancer remain, and a risk of a second malignancy persists. 
Patients with a history of lung cancer remain at increased risk of other 
cancers that are associated with tobacco use including esophageal, head 
and neck, kidney, and bladder cancers. Patients with breast cancer are 
at increased risk of breast cancer in the opposite breast. Patients with 
Hodgkin lymphoma are at risk for other B-cell non-Hodgkin lympho-
mas. Genetic cancer syndromes (e.g., multiple endocrine neoplasia or 
Li-Fraumeni, Lynch’s, Cowden’s, and Gardner’s syndromes) are exam-
ples of genetically based second malignancies of specific types. Cancer 
treatment itself does not appear to be responsible for the risk of these 
secondary malignancies. Genetic disorders that result in DNA repair 
deficiencies  including  ataxia-telangiectasia,  Bloom’s  syndrome,  and 
Fanconi’s anemia greatly increase the lifetime risk of cancers as well as 
the risks associated with DNA-damaging agents. Importantly, the risk 
of treatment-related second malignancies is at least additive and often 
synergistic  with  combined  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy,  and 
hence for such combined-therapy treatment approaches, it is important 
to establish the necessity of each component in the treatment program. 
These patients require indefinite surveillance and prophylactic surgery 
in some cases.

Patients receiving radiation have an increasing and lifelong risk of 
second malignancies that is 1–2% in the second decade following treat-
ment but increases to >25% after 25 years. The risk of second malig-
nancies  from  radiation  is  dose-dependent  and  often  occurs  within 
or  near  the  treatment  field.  Common  radiation-related  solid  tumors 
include central nervous system (CNS), breast, lung, thyroid, skin, and 
bone cancers and sarcomas, which are often aggressive and have a poor 
prognosis. An example of an organ-, age-, and sex-dependent radiation- 
induced  secondary  malignancy  is  breast  cancer,  in  which  the  risk  is 
small with radiation in women aged older than 30 years but increases 
about twentyfold over baseline in women aged younger than 30 years. 
A 25-year-old woman treated with mantle radiation for Hodgkin lym-
phoma has a 29% actuarial risk of developing breast cancer by age 55.
Chemotherapy  is  significantly  associated  with  two  fatal  second 
malignancies:  acute  leukemia  and  myelodysplastic  syndromes.  Two 
types of secondary leukemia have been described; in patients treated 
with  chronic  alkylating  agents  (especially  combined  with  radiation 
therapy),  acute  myeloid  leukemia  is  associated  with  deletions  in 
chromosome  5  or  7  and  complex  karyotypes  and  often  is  preceded 
by  myelodysplasia.  The  lifetime  risk  is  about  1–5%,  is  increased  by 
radiation  therapy,  and  increases  with  age.  The  incidence  of  these 
leukemias peaks at 5–8 years, with risk returning close to baseline at  
10 years. The other type of acute myeloid leukemia is related to therapy 
with topoisomerase inhibitors, is associated with chromosome 11q23 
translocations, has an incidence of <1%, generally occurs 1.5–3 years 
after treatment, and is rarely preceded by myelodysplasia. Both of these 
acute myeloid leukemias are largely refractory to treatment and have 
a  high  mortality.  The  development  of  myelodysplastic  syndromes  is 
increased following chemotherapy, and these cases are often associated 
with  leukemic  progression  and  a  dismal  prognosis.  A  fraction  of  the 
population develops clonal hematopoiesis not related to prior cancer 
treatment,  and  the  percentage  increases  with  age.  In  such  patients, 
the hematopoietic stem cells carry mutations that are associated with 
myeloid malignancy despite normal blood counts. It is thought that the 
presence  of  these  genetic  lesions  may  predispose  patients  to  develop 

myeloid malignancies, but evidence is greater that clonal hematopoie-
sis increases the risk of lymphoma and atherosclerotic heart disease.

Other cytotoxic agents are associated with long-term alterations in 
immunity beyond the initial treatment period and neutrophil recovery. 
Bendamustine has significant effects on both B-cell and T-cell subpop-
ulations that can persist for years, and long-term studies of lymphoma 
patients treated with bendamustine-based regimens show higher rates 
of death from second malignancies compared to other chemotherapy 
regimens.  Purine  analogues  like  cladribine  and  pentostatin  also  pro-
duce  long-term  T-cell  suppression.  The  risk  of  solid  tumors  is  also 
increased  after  chemotherapy,  and  alkylating  agents  increase  the  risk 
of  thyroid,  lung,  breast,  and  bladder  cancers  and  sarcomas.  Cyclo-
phosphamide  increases  the  risk  of  both  sarcoma  and  breast  cancer 
in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  Other  chemotherapy  agents,  including 
procarbazine and platinum agents, have been associated with gastro-
intestinal malignancies. Treatment of breast cancer with tamoxifen for 
5 years or longer is associated with a 1–2% risk of endometrial cancer. 
Surveillance is generally effective at finding these cancers at an early 
stage. The risk of mortality from tamoxifen-induced endometrial can-
cer is low compared to the benefit of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for 
breast cancer. Treatment of multiple myeloma with the immunomod-
ulatory agent lenalidomide is associated with a significantly increased 
risk  of  second  hematologic  malignancies  including  lymphomas  and 
leukemias. These risks are highest after prior use of the alkylating agent 
melphalan.

Given  the  high  risk  of  second  malignancies  in  cancer  survivors, 
patients  need  indefinite  surveillance.  Guidelines  for  breast  cancer 
surveillance  in  survivors  exposed  to  chest  radiation  recommend  that 
patients be screened with mammograms and/or breast MRI beginning 
at age 25 years or 8 years after treatment, whichever occurs later. Any 
organ in the treatment field is susceptible to developing a cancer; e.g., 
radiation  to  the  chest  may  increase  the  risk  of  gastric  or  esophageal 
cancer. Patients exposed to abdominal or pelvic radiation should have 
annual  colonoscopies  starting  at  age  35  years  or  10  years  after  expo-
sure.  For  patients  treated  with  neck  radiation,  no  formal  surveillance 
is  recommended,  but  fine-needle  aspiration  should  be  performed  on 
any palpable thyroid nodules and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 
levels should be monitored periodically.

Combination  chemotherapy  is  also  associated  with  impaired 
immune health and increases the risk of opportunistic infections, auto-
immune complications, and impaired host protection from infections. 
Survivors of lymphoma have elevated risks of developing autoimmune 
hemolytic  anemia,  viral  or  fungal  pneumonias,  meningitis,  or  other 
infections, and these risks remain high decades after treatment. Agents 
or treatment regimens that result in significant T-cell depletion, includ-
ing antithymocyte globulin or antibodies targeting cell surface proteins 
on  T  cells,  increase  the  risk  of  Epstein-Barr  virus–associated  B-cell 
lymphoproliferative  disorders.  Discontinuing  immunosuppressive 
therapy,  if  possible,  is  often  associated  with  complete  disease  regres-
sion.  Anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibodies,  CAR-T  therapy,  bi-specific 
monoclonal antibodies targeting both B cells and T cells, and immune 
checkpoint  inhibitors  have  all  been  associated  with  long-term  B-cell 
aplasia  that  often  requires  intravenous  immunoglobulin  replacement 
and persistent vigilance for recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Ritux-
imab and immunomodulatory agents have both been associated with 
late-onset neutropenia that can occur months after exposure to the drug 
and often requires growth factor support. Given these risks of impaired 
immune system function, all cancer survivors should undergo annual 
influenza  vaccination  and  should  be  considered  for  pneumococcal 
vaccination depending on age and immune health status.

REPRODUCTIVE AND ENDOCRINE 
DYSFUNCTION
Endocrine complications are prevalent in childhood cancer survivors. 
Nearly  half  of  all  survivors  will  have  at  least  one  hormonal  disorder 
in  their  lifetime,  and  these  most  commonly  present  as  late  effects. 
Radiation  to  the  head,  neck,  or  pelvis  is  associated  with  the  greatest 
risk  of  endocrine  dysfunction.  Testicles  and  ovaries  in  prepubertal 
patients  are  sensitive  to  radiation  damage  in  a  dose-related  fashion;

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyspermatogenesis  is  affected  by  low  doses  of  radiation,  and  complete 
azoospermia occurs at 600–700 cGy. Leydig cell dysfunction, in con-
trast,  occurs  at  <2000  cGy,  and  hence,  endocrine  function  is  lost  at 
much higher radiation doses than spermatogenesis. Erectile dysfunc-
tion occurs in up to 80% of men treated with external-beam radiation 
therapy for prostate cancer. Sildenafil may be useful in reversing erec-
tile dysfunction. Ovarian function damage with radiation is age-related 
and occurs at doses of 150–500 cGy. Hormone replacement therapy is 
often contraindicated (as in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer). 
Attention  must  be  paid  to  maintenance  of  bone  mass  with  calcium 
and vitamin D supplements and oral bisphosphonates, and bone mass 
should  be  monitored  using  bone  density  determinations.  Paroxetine, 
clonidine, pregabalin, and other drugs may be useful in symptomati-
cally controlling hot flashes. Long-term survivors of childhood cancer 
who have received cranial radiation may have altered leptin biology and 
growth hormone deficiency, leading to obesity and reduced strength, 
exercise  tolerance,  and  bone  density.  Radiation  therapy  to  the  neck 
may lead to hypothyroidism, Graves’ disease, thyroiditis, and thyroid 
malignancies.  TSH  is  followed  routinely  in  such  patients  to  prevent 
hypothyroidism  and  to  suppress  persistently  elevated  levels  of  TSH, 
which may cause or drive thyroid cancer. Cranial radiation may also 
be associated with an array of endocrine abnormalities with disruption 
of  normal  pituitary-hypothalamic  axis  function,  and  a  high  index  of 
suspicion  needs  to  be  maintained  to  identify  and  treat  this  toxicity. 
Efforts  to  eliminate  unnecessary  radiation  such  as  prophylactic  CNS 
irradiation  may  decrease  some  of  the  late  endocrine  effects.  Patients 
who have received abdominal radiation should receive annual screens 
for obesity and diabetes mellitus with heigh and weight measurements 
along with a hemoglobin A1C at least every 2 years.

Alkylating agents are the chemotherapy agents associated with the 
highest  rates  of  male  and  female  infertility,  which  is  directly  depen-
dent  on  age,  dose,  and  duration  of  treatment.  The  age  at  treatment 
is  an  important  determinant  of  fertility  outcome,  with  prepubertal 
patients  having  the  highest  tolerance.  Ovarian  failure  is  age  related, 
and females who resume menses after treatment are still at increased 
risk for premature menopause. Males generally have reversible azoo-
spermia during lower intensity alkylator chemotherapy, and long-term 
infertility is associated with doses of cyclophosphamide >9 g/m2 and 
with  high-intensity  therapy,  such  as  that  used  in  hematopoietic  stem 
cell transplantation. All patients should be counseled on the potential 
impact  on  future  reproduction,  and  timely  referral  for  established 
interventions  such  as  sperm  cryopreservation,  oocyte  preservation, 
and embryo preservation should be offered when feasible and appro-
priate.  Assisted  reproductive  technologies  can  be  helpful  to  couples 
with chemotherapy-induced infertility.

Combination  chemotherapy  can  impair  bone  health,  and  older 
patients may be more susceptible to these effects. Due to the combined 
risk  of  age-related  osteoporosis  and  the  effect  of  therapy,  the  risk  of 
fractures in patients over the age of 70 years may be as high as 5–10% 
within a few years of finishing therapy. The risk of low bone mineral 
density  is  highest  in  certain  high-risk  groups  including  survivors  of 
pediatric  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  and  CNS  tumors  and  those 
who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  that  target  CTLA-4  and  PD-1 
have  led  to  serious  chronic  toxicities  including  the  breaking  of  self- 
tolerance and the autoimmune destruction of certain endocrine organs, 
particularly  the  thyroid  and  adenohypophysis  (anterior  pituitary). 
Hypophysitis is more commonly reported in association with CTLA-4 
inhibitors,  whereas  thyroid  dysfunction  is  more  common  with  PD-1 
inhibitors. Most immune-related toxicities occur within 8–12 weeks of 
starting treatment, but they can occur at any time during treatment or 
even after therapy has stopped. Patients with autoimmune thyroiditis 
or hypophysitis require lifelong hormone replacement, and early rec-
ognition is important.

Tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  such  as  imatinib  have  been  associated 
with  growth  deceleration  in  children,  particularly  when  treatment  is 
initiated before puberty. The mechanism is postulated to be related to 
disruptions in growth hormone signaling or inhibition of the insulin-
like  growth  factor  1  (IGFR-1)  receptor.  Other  BCR-ABL  inhibitors, 

including  nilotinib  and  dasatinib,  have  been  associated  with  both 
hyper- and hypothyroidism. Endocrine effects that have been reported 
to  be  associated  with  other  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  include  altera-
tions  in  bone  remodeling,  reduced  calcium  and  vitamin  D  levels, 
thyroid dysfunction, gonadal dysfunction, adrenal dysfunction, altered 
glucose  metabolism,  and  secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  Thyroid 
function tests should be monitored periodically while patients are on 
these  targeted  agents,  and  replacement  hormones  and/or  vitamins 
should be prescribed as necessary.

NEUROLOGIC DYSFUNCTION
Neurologic  dysfunction  from  cancer  treatment  is  increasing  in  both 
incidence  and  severity  as  a  result  of  improved  supportive  care  that 
enables  more  aggressive  regimens,  an  expanded  number  of  older 
patients  receiving  treatment,  extended  durations  of  therapy,  and 
longer  periods  of  cancer  survivorship.  Direct  effects  on  myelin,  glial 
cells, and neurons have all been implicated, with alterations in cellular 
cytoskeleton,  axonal  transport,  and  cellular  metabolism  as  potential 
mechanisms. Telomere shortening that occurs with normal aging may 
be accelerated by radiation. Survivors of CNS tumors are at the greatest 
risk  of  late-onset  neurocognitive  impairment  that  includes  impaired 
intelligence and slower processing speeds along with deficits in exec-
utive  function,  memory,  and  attention.  These  toxicities  are  reported 
after  treatment  with  both  radiation  and  chemotherapy  in  childhood 
survivors.

Acute radiation CNS toxicity occurs within weeks and is character-
ized  by  nausea,  drowsiness,  hypersomnia,  and  ataxia,  which  typically 
recover over time. Early delayed toxicity occurring weeks to 3 months 
following therapy is associated with similar symptoms as acute toxicity 
and is pathologically associated with reversible demyelination. Chronic, 
late radiation injury occurs 9 months to up to 10 years following ther-
apy,  and  dysfunction  increases  over  time.  Radiation-associated  spinal 
cord  injury  (myelopathy)  is  highly  dose-dependent  and  rarely  occurs 
with  modern  radiation  therapy.  An  early,  self-limited  form  involving 
electric  sensations  down  the  spine  on  neck  flexion  (Lhermitte’s  sign) 
is seen 6–12 weeks after treatment and generally resolves over weeks. 
Peripheral  nerve  toxicity  is  quite  rare  owing  to  relative  radiation 
resistance. Diffuse radiation injury is associated with global CNS neu-
rologic  dysfunction  and  diffuse  white  matter  changes  on  computed 
tomography  (CT)  or  MRI.  Pathologically,  small  vessel  changes  are 
prominent and focal necrosis is common. Necrotizing encephalopathy 
is the most severe form of radiation injury and almost always is associ-
ated with concurrent use of chemotherapy, notably methotrexate. Pro-
phylactic  cranial  irradiation  in  both  childhood  and  adult  leukemias/
lymphomas has largely been abandoned due to the acute and long-term 
effects of therapy. Glucocorticoids may be symptomatically useful for 
acute toxicities but do not alter the course. Psychostimulants such as 
methylphenidate may improve attention and executive functioning in 
childhood survivors.

In  children  and  adolescent  cancers,  younger  age,  higher  cranial 
irradiation dose, larger brain volumes irradiated, and longer treatment 
times  are  associated  with  worse  neurocognitive  outcomes.  In  adult 
cancers, patients over the age of 60 who receive whole-brain radiation 
therapy are at high risk for neurocognitive impairment after therapy. 
Genetic  polymorphisms  may  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
neurocognitive  problems,  and  emerging  evidence  suggests  polymor-
phisms in the folate pathway, oxidative stress genes, and enzymes that 
regulate  both  catecholamines  and  deamination  of  amines  are  associ-
ated with individual risk.

Vinca alkaloids produce a characteristic “stocking-glove” neuropa-
thy with numbness and tingling advancing to loss of motor function, 
which  is  highly  dose  related.  Distal  sensorimotor  polyneuropathy 
prominently  involves  loss  of  deep  tendon  reflexes  with  initially  loss 
of  pain  and  temperature  sensation,  followed  by  proprioceptive  and 
vibratory  loss.  This  requires  careful  patient  history  and  physical 
examination by experienced oncologists to decide when the drug must 
be  stopped  or  reduced  to  prevent  permanent  damage.  Milder  toxic-
ity  often  slowly  completely  resolves  after  treatment  discontinuation. 
Vinca  alkaloids  may  sometimes  be  associated  with  jaw  claudication,

hoarseness, autonomic neuropathy, ileus, cranial nerve palsies, and, in 
severe  cases,  encephalopathy,  seizures,  and  coma.  Cisplatin  is  associ-
ated with sensorimotor neuropathy and hearing loss, especially at doses  
>400 mg/m2, requiring audiometry in patients with preexisting hearing 
compromise.  Carboplatin  is  often  substituted  in  such  cases  given  its 
lesser effect on hearing. Many of the agents that target kinase enzymes 
in tumor cells and 5-fluorouracil congeners produce dysesthesias and 
painful  hands  and  feet  known  as  hand-foot  syndrome  or  palmar- 
plantar  erythrodysesthesia.  Symptoms  usually  abate  when  the  agent 
is stopped. Methotrexate alone may cause acute leukoencephalopathy 
characterized  by  somnolence  and  confusion  that  is  often  reversible. 
Acute toxicity is dose-related, especially at doses >3 g/m2, with younger 
patients  being  at  greater  risk.  Subacute  methotrexate  toxicity  occurs 
weeks after therapy and is often ameliorated with glucocorticoid ther-
apy.  Chronic  methotrexate  toxicity  (leukoencephalopathy)  develops 
months or years after treatment and is characterized clinically as pro-
gressive  loss  of  cognitive  function  and  focal  neurologic  signs,  which 
are irreversible, promoted by synchronous or metachronous radiation 
therapy,  and  more  pronounced  at  a  younger  age.  Neurocognitive 
decline following chemotherapy alone occurs notably in breast cancer 
patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, 
or  cyclophosphamide;  this  has  been  referred  to  as  “chemo  brain.”  It 
is  clinically  associated  with  impaired  memory,  learning,  attention, 
and  speed  of  information  processing.  There  is  no  clear  mechanistic 
explanation for its cause and no clearly effective therapy, although reg-
ular exercise is associated with improved symptoms. Most symptoms 
improve within a year of therapy, but symptoms can persist in 10–20% 
of patients for extended periods of time.

Newer  molecularly  targeted  agents  and  immunotherapy  have  also 
been  associated  with  neurologic  dysfunction  and  may  exacerbate 
persistent  neuropathy  from  prior  therapy.  Proteasome  inhibitors  are 
associated  with  neuropathic  pain  and  motor  neuropathy  that  can 
occur immediately or be delayed in onset. The proposed mechanism 
is  through  enhanced  oxidative  stress  on  neural  cells.  Subcutaneous 
administration of these agents is associated with less peripheral neu-
ropathy  than  intravenous  infusions.  Immunotherapy  agents  such  as 
CAR-T  therapies  and  bi-specific  monoclonal  antibodies  targeting 
both  T  cells  and  B  cells  are  associated  with  significant  acute  neuro-
toxicity including confusion, encephalopathy, seizures, and cerebellar 
symptoms. These symptoms are hypothesized to be related to the CRS 
associated with these therapies and often are time limited. However, a 
minority of patients treated with these agents will have persistent cen-
tral and neurologic dysfunction for which management is mainly sup-
portive. Glucocorticoids may be useful in the short term, but treatment 
with interleukin 6 receptor antagonists that are effective for decreasing 
the severity of CRS is largely ineffective at preventing neurologic tox-
icities.  Progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML)  is  a  rare 
but serious brain infection that is caused by the JC virus and has been 
reported as a rare complication of treatment with rituximab, ibrutinib, 
and PI3K inhibitors. The inflammatory response to the virus presents 
as unifocal or multifocal hyperintense lesions involving the subcortical 
white matter that are best seen on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recov-
ery  (FLAIR)  images  on  MRI.  Treatment  is  supportive  and  includes 
removal of the offending agent. Other targeted agents that may be asso-
ciated with neurologic dysfunction when given for extended durations 
of treatment include dasatinib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide.

Antibody-drug  conjugates  (ADCs)  are  novel  therapies  in  which 
a  monoclonal  antibody  targeted  to  a  tumor  antigen  is  attached  to  a 
potent anticancer agent via a chemical linker. Often, these agents are 
associated with significant central and peripheral neurotoxicity, as has 
been  described  with  agents  such  as  brentuximab  vedotin  and  pertu-
zumab. These neuropathies often emerge during treatment similar to 
those  seen  with  chemotherapy  and  are  dose-dependent.  Early  recog-
nition of treatment-emergent neuropathy induced by ADCs mandates 
dose interruption or modification to less frequent dosing schedules in 
order for patients to remain on therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
have  been  associated  with  autoimmune  complications  and  unique 
neurologic manifestations such as optic neuritis that may be reversible 
after glucocorticoids.

HEPATIC AND GASTROINTESTINAL 
DYSFUNCTION
Long-term  hepatic  damage  from  standard  chemotherapy  regimens 
is  rare.  Long-term  methotrexate  or  high-dose  chemotherapy  alone 
or  with  radiation  therapy,  for  example,  in  preparative  regimens  for 
bone  marrow  transplantation,  may  result  in  venoocclusive  disease 
of  the  liver.  This  potentially  lethal  complication  classically  presents 
with  anicteric  ascites,  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase,  and  hepatosple-
nomegaly.  Pathologically,  there  is  venous  congestion,  epithelial  cell 
proliferation,  and  hepatocyte  atrophy  progressing  to  frank  fibrosis. 
Frequent monitoring of liver function tests during any chemotherapy 
is necessary to avoid both idiosyncratic and expected toxicities. Certain 
nucleoside drugs have been associated with hepatic dysfunction; how-
ever, this complication is rare in oncology. Hepatic radiation damage 
depends on dose, volume, fractionation, preexisting liver disease, and 
synchronous  or  metachronous  chemotherapy.  In  general,  radiation 
doses to the liver >1500 cGy can produce hepatic dysfunction with a 
steep dose-injury curve. Radiation-induced liver disease closely mim-
ics hepatic venoocclusive disease.

Novel targeted agents including immunotherapy agents have intro-
duced a number of gastrointestinal toxicities that can occur late in the 
course  of  treatment  including  hepatitis,  colitis,  malabsorption,  and 
chronic diarrhea. Early signs of serious liver injury should lead to dis-
continuation of the offending agent as the effect does not appear to be 
dose-related  and  dose  reductions  do  not  reliably  reduce  further  liver 
injury.  The  mechanisms  for  colitis  or  hepatitis  associated  with  these 
targeted agents are not completely understood but are hypothesized to 
be T cell–mediated, and the risk is highest when used in targeted agent 
combinations. Diarrhea with or without severe colitis can be associated 
with virtually all targeted agents including PI3K inhibitors, BCR-ABL 
inhibitors,  BTK  inhibitors,  EGFR  inhibitors,  MEK  inhibitors,  CDK 
inhibitors,  and  immunomodulatory  agents.  Even  if  the  diarrhea  is 
not  severe,  the  impact  associated  with  indefinite  treatment  greatly 
interferes with the quality of life and often leads to discontinuation of 
targeted therapy if not managed effectively. Immunomodulatory agents 
including lenalidomide are associated with late onset of diarrhea that 
is  caused  by  bile  acid  malabsorption  and  often  responds  to  bile  acid 
sequestrants. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with colitis 
and hepatitis that may be responsive to prompt initiation of glucocor-
ticoids that may require a long taper for resolution.

RENAL AND BLADDER DYSFUNCTION
Cisplatin  produces  reversible  decrements  in  renal  function  but  may 
also  produce  severe  irreversible  toxicity  in  the  presence  of  renal  dis-
ease and may predispose to accentuated damage with subsequent renal 
insults.  Cyclophosphamide  and  ifosfamide  are  prodrugs  primarily 
activated  in  the  liver  with  cleavage  products  (acrolein)  that  can  pro-
duce hemorrhagic cystitis. This can be prevented with the free radical 
scavenger MESNA (mercaptoethane sulfonate), which is required for 
ifosfamide administration. Hemorrhagic cystitis caused by these agents 
may predispose to bladder cancer.

Targeted agents generally do not carry significant acute nephrotoxic 
risks,  but  a  number  of  agents,  including  PI3K  inhibitors,  anti-VEGF 
agents, and FLT3 inhibitors, are associated with systemic hypertension, 
which can lead to late effects or a progressive decline in renal function. 
Renal dysfunction following immunotherapy is uncommon, but acute 
interstitial nephritis can occur. Similar to other immune-related toxici-
ties, this acute toxicity requires prompt use of glucocorticoids to avoid 
long-term effects on renal function.

PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION 
AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT OF 
SURVIVORSHIP
The  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  cancer  can  introduce  long-term  and 
late psychological effects that continue throughout life. Cancer survi-
vors are at increased risk for anxiety, depression, attention problems, 
and posttraumatic stress syndromes. Many cancer patients experience 
intrusive  or  debilitating  concerns  about  cancer  recurrence  following 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   742

21/01/22   3:50 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologysuccessful  therapy.  In  addition,  these  patients  may  experience  socio-
economic  stressors  that  affect  employment,  insurance,  relationships 
and  lead  to  financial  and/or  sexual  difficulties.  Survivors  of  child-
hood cancers are less likely to graduate from college or gain full-time 
employment  than  their  peers  and  are  more  likely  to  engage  in  risky 
health  behaviors  such  as  substance  abuse  and  excessive  alcohol  use. 
The long-term psychosocial effects of treatment are greatest in patients 
who undergo CNS-directed therapies including radiation and intensive 
combination  chemotherapy  regimens.  Oncologists  should  ask  about 
and address these issues explicitly with patients and provide appropri-
ate counseling or support systems. The overall risk of suicidal ideation 
and suicide is low but is greater in cancer patients and survivors than 
age-matched  controls.  Tailored  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  may 
improve  the  anxiety  and  posttraumatic  stress  associated  with  cancer 
survivorship.

CANCER SURVIVORSHIP CARE PLANS
Survivorship starts at the time of diagnosis and continues indefinitely. 
Many  guidelines  recommend  that  every  patient  be  provided  with  a 
survivorship care plan unique to their situation, but the evidence that 
these  improve  health  outcomes  is  limited  and  sufficient  resources  to 
implement  recommendations  are  often  lacking.  Focused  surveillance 
plans  for  late  effects  are  critical  for  early  detection  and  implementa-
tion of interventions but also must include risk stratification to avoid 
unnecessary  surveillance  testing  that  wastes  resources  and  leads  to 
overdiagnosis and/or psychological distress. Survivorship care has tra-
ditionally been performed by oncologists, but the scope of the problem 
mandates  that  primary  care  physicians,  midlevel  providers,  and  pre-
ventive medicine specialists be trained in the follow-up of treated can-
cer patients in remission. All former cancer patients should undergo 
surveillance for recurrence and second malignancies and be monitored 
for long-term effects of treatment; however, as a practical matter, nearly 
all recurrences are detected because of symptoms. Health promotion 
and  disease  prevention  with  age-  and  sex-specific  routine  screening 
tests (e.g., colonoscopy, Pap smears, mammography, human papilloma-
virus vaccination, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans) should be a 
focus of survivorship care along with psychosocial well-being. Annual 
mammography should start no later than 10 years after breast radia-
tion.  Patients  receiving  radiation  fields  encompassing  thyroid  tissue 
should have regular thyroid examinations and TSH testing. Localized 
pain  or  palpable  abnormality  in  a  previously  radiated  field  should 
prompt radiographic evaluation. Patients treated with alkylating agents 
or topoisomerase inhibitors should have a complete blood count every 
6–12 months, and cytopenias, abnormal cells on peripheral smear, or 
macrocytosis should be evaluated with bone marrow biopsy and aspi-
rate and include cytogenetics, flow cytometry, or fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) studies as appropriate.

As  the  population  of  cancer  survivors  increases  and  patients  live 
longer,  cancer  survivorship  has  become  increasingly  important,  and 
the  Institute  of  Medicine  and  National  Research  Council  have  pub-
lished a monograph entitled From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: 
Lost in Transition. The monograph proposes a plan that would inform 
clinicians caring for cancer survivors of the complete details of patients’ 
previous treatments, complications thereof, signs and symptoms of late 
effects, and recommended screening and follow-up procedures.

OUTLOOK
Survivorship  care  is  one  of  the  most  challenging  problems  facing 
oncologists today. The challenge is to develop cancer treatments that 
utilize the most effective combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radia-
tion, targeted agents, or immunotherapy that is required to cure disease 
or  effect  long-term  disease  control  with  the  least  amount  of  toxicity. 
As  cancer  treatments  continue  to  improve,  the  need  for  cancer  care 
increases due to more cancer survivors with increasing life expectancy. 
Clearly, much work remains to elucidate the pathophysiology of cancer 
treatment–related  effects  and  identification  of  patient  characteristics 
associated  with  an  increased  vulnerability  to  adverse  effects.  Clin-
ical  management  strategies  focused  on  the  clinical  management  of 
acute  toxicities  and  prevention  of  long-term  effects  after  therapy  are 

necessary.  Finally,  research  initiatives  should  recognize  that  as  treat-
ment paradigms continue to evolve, the nature and biologic basis for 
toxicities will change. Advances in genomic medicine may add depth 
to  our  understanding  of  toxicities  and  allow  for  more  personalized 
surveillance strategies. Longitudinal monitoring of the health of cancer 
survivors  is  required  since  the  incidence  of  late  effects  of  treatment 
does not appear to plateau over time.

Section 2  Hematopoietic Disorders

96 Hematopoietic Stem 

Cells
David T. Scadden, Dan L. Longo

All of the cell types in the peripheral blood and some cells in every tis-
sue of the body are derived from hematopoietic (hemo: blood; poiesis: 
creation) stem cells. If the hematopoietic stem cell is damaged and can 
no  longer  function  (e.g.,  due  to  a  nuclear  accident),  a  person  would 
survive 2–4 weeks in the absence of extraordinary support measures. 
With the clinical use of hematopoietic stem cells, tens of thousands of 
lives  are  saved  each  year  (Chap.  114).  Stem  cells  produce  hundreds 
of billions of blood cells daily from a stem cell pool that is estimated 
to be only 100,000. How stem cells do this, how they persist for many 
decades despite the production demands, and how they may be better 
used in clinical care are important issues in medicine.

The  study  of  blood  cell  production  has  become  a  paradigm  for 
how  other  tissues  may  be  organized  and  regulated.  Basic  research  in 
hematopoiesis  includes  defining  stepwise  molecular  changes  accom-
panying  functional  changes  in  maturing  cells,  aggregating  cells  into 
functional  subgroups,  and  demonstrating  hematopoietic  stem  cell

regulation  by  a  specialized  microenvironment;  these  concepts  are 
worked  out  in  hematology  and  offer  models  for  other  tissues.  More-
over, these concepts may not be restricted to normal tissue function but 
extend to malignancy. Stem cells are rare cells among a heterogeneous 
population of cell types, and their behavior is assessed mainly in exper-
imental  animal  models  involving  reconstitution  of  hematopoiesis. 
Thus, much of what we know about stem cells is imprecise and based 
on inferences from genetically manipulated animals.

CARDINAL FUNCTIONS OF 
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS
All stem cell types have two cardinal functions: self-renewal and differ-
entiation (Fig. 96-1). Stem cells exist to generate, maintain, and repair 
tissues.  They  function  successfully  if  they  can  replace  a  wide  variety 
of  shorter-lived  mature  cells  over  prolonged  periods.  The  process  of 
self-renewal  (see  below)  assures  that  a  stem  cell  population  can  be 
sustained  over  time.  Without  self-renewal,  the  stem  cell  pool  would 
become exhausted and tissue maintenance would not be possible. The 
process of differentiation leads to production of the effectors of tissue 
function: mature cells. Without proper differentiation, the integrity of 
tissue function would be compromised and organ failure or neoplasia 
would ensue.

In the blood, mature cells have variable average life spans, ranging 
from hours for mature neutrophils to a few months for red blood cells 
to many years for memory lymphocytes. However, the stem cell pool is 
the central, durable source of all blood and immune cells, maintaining 
a capacity to produce a broad range of cells from a single cell source, 
yet keeping itself vigorous over decades of life. As an individual stem 
cell  divides,  it  has  the  capacity  to  accomplish  one  of  three  division 
outcomes: two stem cells, two cells destined for differentiation, or one 
stem cell and one differentiating cell. The former two outcomes are the 
result of symmetric cell division, whereas the latter indicates a different 
outcome for the two daughter cells—an event termed asymmetric cell 
division. The relative balance for these types of outcomes may change 
during  development  and  under  particular  kinds  of  demands  on  the 
stem cell pool.
 ■ DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY OF HEMATOPOIETIC 
STEM CELLS
During  development,  blood  cells  are  produced  at  different  sites. 
Initially,  the  yolk  sac  provides  oxygen-carrying  red  blood  cells  and 
many of the macrophage-like cells that are resident in tissues: cells like 
microglia in the brain. The placenta and several sites of intraembryonic 
blood cell production then become involved in sequential order. These

FIGURE  96-1  Signature  characteristics  of  the  stem  cell.  Stem  cells  have  two 
essential features: the capacity to differentiate into a variety of mature cell types and 
the capacity for self-renewal. Intrinsic factors associated with self-renewal include 
expression of Bmi-1, Gfi-1, PTEN, STAT5, Tel/Atv6, p21, p18, MCL-1, Mel-18, RAE28, 
and HoxB4. Extrinsic signals for self-renewal include Notch, Wnt, SHH, angiogenin, 
and Tie2/Ang-1. Based mainly on murine studies, hematopoietic stem cells express 
the  following  cell  surface  molecules:  CD34,  Thy-1  (CD90),  c-Kit  receptor  (CD117), 
CD133, CD164, and c-Mpl (CD110, also known as the thrombopoietin receptor).

move from the genital ridge at a site where the aorta, gonadal tissue, 
and mesonephros are emerging to the fetal liver and then, in the sec-
ond trimester, to the bone marrow and spleen. As the location of stem 
cells changes, the cells they produce also change. The yolk sac provides 
red cells expressing embryonic hemoglobins and tissue-resident mac-
rophages.  Intraembryonic  sites  of  hematopoiesis  generate  stem  cells, 
red  cells,  platelets,  and  the  circulating  cells  of  innate  immunity.  The 
production of the cells of adaptive immunity occurs then as well but 
becomes robust as the thymus forms and the bone marrow is colonized 
in the second trimester. Stem cell proliferation remains high, even in 
the bone marrow, until shortly after birth, when it appears to dramat-
ically decline. The cells in the bone marrow are thought to arrive by 
the bloodborne transit of cells from the fetal liver after calcification of 
the long bones has begun. The presence of stem cells in the circulation 
is not unique to a time window in development, however, as hemato-
poietic  stem  cells  circulate  throughout  life.  The  time  that  stem  cells 
spend  freely  circulating  appears  to  be  brief  (measured  in  minutes  in  
the mouse), but the stem cells that do circulate are functional and can 
be used for transplantation. The number of stem cells that circulate can 
be increased in a number of ways to facilitate harvest and transfer to 
the same or a different host.

 ■ MOBILITY OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS
Cells entering and exiting the bone marrow do so through a series of 
molecular  interactions.  Circulating  stem  cells  (through  CD162  and 
CD44)  engage  the  lectins  (carbohydrate  binding  proteins)  P-  and 
E-selectin  on  the  endothelial  surface  to  slow  the  movement  of  the 
cells to a rolling phenotype. Stem cell integrins are then activated and 
accomplish firm adhesion between the stem cell and vessel wall, with 
a  particularly  important  role  for  stem  cell  VCAM-1  engaging  endo-
thelial VLA-4. The chemokine CXCL12 (SDF1) interacting with stem 
cell CXCR4 receptors and ionic calcium interacting with the calcium-
sensing  receptor  appear  to  be  important  in  the  process  of  stem  cells 
getting from the circulation to where they engraft in the bone marrow. 
This is particularly true in the developmental move from fetal liver to 
bone marrow.

In the adult, the role for CXCR4 is in retention of stem cells in the 
bone marrow as well as getting them there. Interrupting that retention 
process  through  specific  molecular  blockers  of  the  CXCR4/CXCL12 
interaction,  cleavage  of  CXCL12,  or  downregulation  of  the  CXCR4 
receptor can result in the release of stem cells into the circulation. This 
process is an increasingly important aspect of recovering stem cells for 
therapeutic use as it has permitted the harvesting process to be done 
by leukapheresis rather than bone marrow punctures in the operating 
room.  Granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  and  plerixafor,  a  mac-
rocyclic compound that can block CXCR4, are both used clinically to 
mobilize marrow hematopoietic stem cells for transplant. Refining our 
knowledge of how stem cells get into and out of the bone marrow may 
improve our ability to obtain stem cells and make them more efficient 
at finding their way to the specific sites for blood cell production, the 
so-called stem cell niche.

 ■ HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL 
MICROENVIRONMENT
The concept of a specialized microenvironment, or stem cell niche, was 
first proposed to explain why cells derived from the bone marrow of 
one animal could be used in transplantation and again be found in the 
bone marrow of the recipient. This niche is more than just a housing 
site for stem cells, however. It is an anatomic location where regulatory 
signals  are  provided  that  allow  the  stem  cells  to  thrive,  to  expand  if 
needed, and to provide varying amounts of descendant daughter cells. 
In  addition,  unregulated  growth  of  stem  cells  may  be  problematic 
based on their undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity. Thus, 
the niche must also regulate the number of stem cells produced. In this 
manner, the niche has the dual function of serving as a site of nurture 
but imposing limits for stem cells: in effect, acting as both a nutritive 
and constraining home.

The  niche  for  blood  stem  cells  changes  with  each  of  the  sites  of 
blood production during development, but for most of human life, it

is located in the bone marrow. Within the bone marrow, the perivas-
cular space particularly in regions of trabecular bone serves as a niche. 
The  mesenchymal  and  endothelial  cells  of  the  marrow  microvessels 
produce  kit  ligand  and  CXCL12,  both  known  to  be  important  for 
hematopoietic  stem  cells.  Other  cell  types,  such  as  sympathetic  neu-
rons,  nonmyelinating  Schwann  cells,  macrophages,  megakaryocytes, 
osteoclasts,  and  osteoblasts,  have  been  shown  to  regulate  stem  cells, 
some  by  direct  and  others  by  indirect  effects.  Extracellular  matrix 
proteins  like  osteopontin  and  heparan  sulfates  also  affect  stem  cell 
function.  The  endosteal  region  appears  to  be  particularly  important 
for transplanted cells, in part because many of the mesenchymal cells 
and sinusoidal blood vessels of the central marrow are disrupted by the 
conditioning  regimens  used  to  prepare  a  patient  for  transplantation. 
The functioning of the niche as a supportive context for stem cells is of 
obvious importance for maintaining hematopoiesis and in transplanta-
tion. An active area of study involves determining whether the niche is 
altered in disease as experimental models have shown that mutations 
in niche cells can lead to myeloid malignancies. It logically follows that 
targeting of niche functions is a potential therapeutic strategy for both 
malignant and normal hematopoiesis.

 ■ EXCESS CAPACITY OF HEMATOPOIETIC  
STEM CELLS
In  the  absence  of  disease,  one  never  runs  out  of  hematopoietic  stem 
cells. Indeed, serial transplantation studies in mice suggest that suffi-
cient stem cells are present to reconstitute several animals in succes-
sion, with each animal having normal blood cell production. The fact 
that  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant  recipients  also  never  run  out  of 
blood cells in their life span, which can extend for decades, argues that 
even the limiting numbers of stem cells provided to them are sufficient. 
How stem cells respond to different conditions to increase or decrease 
their  mature  cell  production  remains  poorly  understood.  Clearly, 
negative feedback mechanisms affect the level of production of most 
of the cells, leading to the normal tightly regulated blood cell counts. 
However, many of the regulatory mechanisms that govern production 
of  more  mature  progenitor  cells  do  not  apply  or  apply  differently  to 
stem cells. Similarly, most of the molecules shown to be able to change 
the size of the stem cell pool have little effect on more mature blood 
cells. For example, the growth factor erythropoietin, which stimulates 
red blood cell production from precursor cells, has no effect on stem 
cells. Similarly, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor drives the rapid 
proliferation  of  granulocyte  precursors  but  has  little  or  no  effect  on 
the  cell  cycling  of  stem  cells.  Rather,  it  changes  the  location  of  stem 
cells by indirect means, altering molecules such as CXCL12 that tether 
stem cells to their niche. Molecules shown to be important for altering 
the proliferation, self-renewal, or survival of stem cells, such as cyclin- 
dependent kinase inhibitors, transcription factors like Bmi-1, microRNA- 
processing  enzymes  like  Dicer,  or  even  metabolic  regulators  like  
pyruvate kinase isoforms, have little or different effects on progenitor 
cells.  Hematopoietic  stem  cells  have  governing  mechanisms  that  are 
distinct from the cells they generate.

 ■ HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Hematopoietic  stem  cells  sit  at  the  base  of  a  branching  hierarchy  of 
cells  culminating  in  the  many  mature  cell  types  that  compose  the 
blood and immune system (Fig. 96-2). The maturation steps leading 
to terminally differentiated and functional blood cells take place both 
as  a  consequence  of  intrinsic  changes  in  gene  expression  and  niche-
directed and cytokine-directed changes in the cells. Our knowledge of 
the  details  remains  incomplete.  As  stem  cells  mature  to  progenitors, 
precursors, and, finally, mature effector cells, they undergo a series of 
functional changes. These include the obvious acquisition of functions 
defining  mature  blood  cells,  such  as  phagocytic  capacity  or  hemo-
globin  synthesis.  They  also  include  the  progressive  loss  of  plasticity 
(i.e., the ability to become other cell types). For example, the myeloid 
progenitor can make all cells in the myeloid series but none in the lym-
phoid  series.  As  common  myeloid  progenitors  mature,  they  become 
precursors for either monocytes and granulocytes or erythrocytes and 
megakaryocytes,  but  not  both.  Some  amount  of  reversibility  of  this 

process may exist early in the differentiation cascade, but that is lost 
beyond a distinct stage in normal physiologic conditions. With genetic 
interventions,  however,  blood  cells,  like  other  somatic  cells,  can  be 
reprogrammed to become a variety of cell types.

As  cells  differentiate,  they  may  also  lose  proliferative  capacity  
(Fig.  96-3).  Mature  granulocytes  are  incapable  of  proliferation  and 
only increase in number by increased production from precursors. The 
exceptions  to  the  rule  are  some  tissue-resident  macrophages,  which 
appear  capable  of  proliferation,  and  lymphoid  cells.  Lymphoid  cells 
retain the capacity to proliferate but have linked their proliferation to 
the  recognition  of  particular  proteins  or  peptides  by  specific  antigen 
receptors on their surface. Like many tissues with short-lived mature 
cells  such  as  the  skin  and  intestine,  blood  cell  proliferation  is  largely 
accomplished by a more immature progenitor population. In general, 
cells  within  the  highly  proliferative  progenitor  cell  compartment  are 
also  relatively  short-lived,  making  their  way  through  the  differentia-
tion process in a defined molecular program involving the sequential 
activation of particular sets of genes. For any particular cell type, the 
differentiation program is difficult to speed up. The time it takes for 
hematopoietic  progenitors  to  become  mature  cells  is  ~10–14  days  in 
humans,  evident  clinically  by  the  interval  between  cytotoxic  chemo-
therapy and blood count recovery in patients.

Although hematopoietic stem cells are generally thought to have the 
capacity to form all cells of the blood, it is becoming clear that individ-
ual stem cells may not be equal in their differentiation potential. That 
is, some stem cells are “biased” to become mature cells of a particular 
type. In addition, the general concept of cells having a binary choice 
of lymphoid or myeloid differentiation is not entirely accurate. A cell 
population  with  limited  megakaryocytic  and  erythroid  or  myeloid 
(monocyte and granulocyte) and lymphoid potential is now added to 
the commitment steps stem cells may undergo.

 ■ SELF-RENEWAL
The  hematopoietic  stem  cell  must  balance  its  three  potential  fates: 
apoptosis,  self-renewal,  and  differentiation.  The  proliferation  of  cells 
is generally not associated with the ability to undergo a self-renewing 
division except among memory T and B cells and among stem cells. 
Self-renewal  capacity  has  generally  been  regarded  as  giving  way  to 
differentiation  as  the  only  option  after  cell  division  when  cells  leave 
the stem cell compartment, unless they become memory lymphocytes. 
However,  emerging  data  suggest  that  some  myeloid  committed  pro-
genitors may also have self-renewing potential in vivo, providing long-
term production of cells. Stem cells all have self-renewing capacity by 
definition,  and  they  have  an  additional  feature  characterizing  their 
proliferation  machinery.  Stem  cells  in  many  mature  adult  tissues  are 
heterogeneous  with  some  being  deeply  quiescent,  serving  as  a  deep 
reserve, whereas others are more proliferative and replenish the short-
lived  progenitor  population.  In  the  hematopoietic  system,  stem  cells 
are generally cytokine-resistant, remaining dormant even when cytok-
ines  drive  bone  marrow  progenitors  to  proliferation  rates  measured 
in  hours.  Stem  cells,  in  contrast,  are  thought  to  divide  at  far  longer 
intervals,  measured  in  months  to  years,  for  the  most  quiescent  cells. 
This quiescence is difficult to overcome in vitro, limiting the ability to 
effectively expand human hematopoietic stem cells. The process may 
be  controlled  by  particularly  high  levels  of  cyclin-dependent  kinase 
inhibitors like p57 or CDKN1c that restrict entry of stem cells into the 
cell  cycle,  blocking  the  G1-S  transition.  Exogenous  signals  from  the 
niche also appear to enforce quiescence, including angiogenin, inter-
leukin 18, and perhaps angiopoietin 1.

The  regulation  of  stem  cell  proliferation  also  appears  to  change 
with age. Both cell intrinsic features like the cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor p16INK4a and bone marrow microenvironment features like 
declining  sympathetic  innervation  are  implicated  in  age-related  stem 
cell  changes.  Either  lowering  expression  of  p16INK4a  or  stimulating 
beta-3 adrenergic receptors in older animals improves stem cell cycling 
and capacity to reconstitute hematopoiesis in adoptive hosts, making 
them similar to younger animals. Mature cell numbers are unaffected. 
Therefore, molecular events governing the specific functions of stem 
cells  are  being  gradually  made  clear  and  offer  the  potential  of  new

FIGURE 96-2  Hierarchy of hematopoietic differentiation. Stem cells are multipotent cells that are the source of all descendant cells and have the capacity to provide 
either long-term (measured in years) or short-term (measured in months) cell production. Progenitor cells have a more limited spectrum of cells they can produce and are 
generally a shorter-lived, highly proliferative population also known as transient amplifying cells. Precursor cells are cells committed to a single blood cell lineage but with 
a continued ability to proliferate; they do not have all the features of a fully mature cell. Mature cells are the terminally differentiated product of the differentiation process 
and are the effector cells of specific activities of the blood and immune system. Progress through the pathways is mediated by alterations in gene expression. The regulation 
of the differentiation by soluble factors and cell-cell communications within the bone marrow niche are still being defined. The transcription factors that characterize 
particular cell transitions are illustrated on the arrows; the soluble factors that contribute to the differentiation process are in blue. This picture is a simplification of the 
process. Active research is revealing multiple discrete cell types in the maturation of B cells and T cells and has identified cells that are biased toward one lineage or 
another (rather than uncommitted) in their differentiation. EPO, erythropoietin; RBC, red blood cell; SCF, stem cell factor; TPO, thrombopoietin.

therapeutic  approaches  to  changing  stem  cell  functions.  One  critical 
stem cell function that remains poorly defined is the molecular regu-
lation of self-renewal.

For medicine, self-renewal is perhaps the most important function 
of  stem  cells  because  it  is  critical  in  regulating  the  number  of  stem 
cells. Stem cell number is a key limiting parameter for both autologous 
and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Were we to have the ability to 
use fewer stem cells or expand limited numbers of stem cells ex vivo, 
it might be possible to reduce the morbidity and expense of stem cell 
harvests, enable use of other stem cell sources, and improve the poten-
tial for gene-modified stem cell transplant. For example, umbilical cord 
blood is a rich source of stem cells but generally has an inadequate num-
ber of stem cells for use in transplantation in adults. These cells have 
two advantages over other stem cell sources: there is a lower incidence 
of graft-versus-host disease, and cord blood banks have representation 
of  populations  underrepresented  in  adult  donor  registries.  Hemato-
poietic  reconstitution  from  cord  blood  is  slow,  however,  in  part  due 
to  cell  number.  Expansion  might  improve  this;  however,  advances  in 
haploidentical donor cell transplantation have reduced cord blood use.
Gene-modified  stem  cells  are  increasingly  being  tested  and  have 
been found to offer great promise for genetic blood diseases like con-
genital immunodeficiencies and hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell

cells for transplantation is problematic. Expanding a small number of 
gene-modified  stem  cells  may  mitigate  that  issue.  Therefore,  under-
standing  self-renewal  offers  the  potential  to  facilitate  development 
of  an  important  new  area  of  stem  cell–based  medicine.  Some  limited 
understanding of self-renewal exists and, intriguingly, implicates gene 
products  that  are  associated  with  the  chromatin  state,  a  high-order 
organization  of  chromosomal  DNA  that  influences  transcription. 
These include members of the polycomb family, a group of zinc finger– 
containing  transcriptional  regulators  that  interact  with  the  chromatin 
structure, contributing to the accessibility of groups of genes for tran-
scription. One member, Bmi-1, is important in enabling hematopoietic 
stem cell self-renewal through modification of cell cycle regulators such 
as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In the absence of Bmi-1 or 
of the transcriptional regulator, Gfi-1, hematopoietic stem cells decline 
in number and function. In contrast, dysregulation of Bmi-1 has been 
associated  with  leukemia;  it  may  promote  leukemic  stem  cell  self- 
renewal  when  it  is  overexpressed.  The  same  is  true  for  the  polycomb 
gene, Asxl1, that is commonly mutated in myelodysplasia and leukemia. 
Other  transcription  regulators  have  also  been  associated  with  self- 
renewal,  particularly  homeobox,  or  “hox,”  genes.  These  transcription 
factors  are  named  for  their  ability  to  govern  large  numbers  of  genes, 
including those determining body patterning in invertebrates. HoxB4 
is capable of inducing extensive self-renewal of stem cells through its 
DNA-binding  motif.  Other  members  of  the  hox  family  of  genes  have 
been noted to affect normal stem cells, but they are also associated with 
leukemia.  Epigenetic  modifiers  such  as  the  DNA  methyl  transferase 
DNMT3a  or  the  dioxygenase  involved  in  DNA  demethylation,  Tet2, 
also play a role in stem cell regulation. Like Asxl1, mutations of these 
genes  are  associated  with  clonal  outgrowth  of  stem  cells  bearing  the 
mutations. These mutations are not sufficient for malignancy, but they 
enable clones bearing them to gain dominance and predispose cells to 
malignant transformation. They are often referred to as “founder muta-
tions” because myelodysplastic and leukemic cells appear to evolve from 
them by DNA sequencing analysis.

CANCER IS SIMILAR TO AN ORGAN WITH 
SELF-RENEWING CAPACITY
The relationship of stem cells to cancer is an important dimension of 
adult  stem  cell  biology.  Cancer  may  share  principles  of  organization 
with normal tissues. Cancer cells are heterogeneous even within a given 
patient and may have a hierarchical organization of cells with a base of 
stem-like cells capable of the signature stem cell features: self-renewal 
and differentiation. These stem-like cells might be the basis for perpet-
uation of the tumor and represent a slowly dividing, rare population 
with  distinct  regulatory  mechanisms,  including  a  relationship  with  a 
specialized microenvironment. A subpopulation of self-renewing cells 
has been defined for some, but not all, cancers. These include myeloid 
leukemias where founder mutations appear to enable clones of cells to 
expand.  With  additional  mutations,  these  can  serve  as  the  initiating 
or stem cells of a cancer, and eliminating them may be necessary for 
curing  the  patient.  Understanding  the  hierarchical  cell  organization 
within  cancers  and  whether  eliminating  cancer  stem  cell  equivalents 
can improve cure rates is an area of active investigation.

Does the concept of cancer stem cells provide insight into the cellu-
lar origin of cancer? The fact that some cells within a cancer have stem 
cell–like properties does not necessarily mean that the cancer arose in 
the stem cell itself. Rather, more mature cells could have acquired the 
self-renewal  characteristics  of  stem  cells.  Any  single  genetic  event  is 
unlikely to be sufficient to enable full transformation of a normal cell 
to a frankly malignant one. Rather, cancer is a multistep process, and 
for the multiple steps to accumulate, the cell of origin must be able to 
persist  for  prolonged  periods.  It  must  also  be  able  to  generate  large 
numbers of daughter cells. The normal stem cell has these properties 
and,  by  virtue  of  its  having  intrinsic  self-renewal  capability,  may  be 
more readily converted to a malignant phenotype. This hypothesis has 
been tested experimentally in the hematopoietic system. Taking advan-
tage of the cell-surface markers that distinguish hematopoietic cells of 
varying maturity, stem cells, progenitors, precursors, and mature cells 

can  be  isolated.  Powerful  transforming  gene  constructs  were  placed 
in these cells, and it was found that the cell with the greatest potential 
to produce a malignancy was dependent on the transforming gene. In 
some cases, it was the stem cell, but in others, the progenitor cell func-
tioned to initiate and perpetuate the cancer. This shows that cells can 
acquire stem cell–like properties in malignancy.

WHAT ELSE CAN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM 
CELLS DO?
Some experimental data have suggested that hematopoietic stem cells 
or  other  bone  marrow  cells  are  capable  of  playing  a  role  in  healing 
the vascular and tissue damage associated with stroke and myocardial 
infarction. These data are controversial, and the applicability of a stem 
cell  approach  to  nonhematopoietic  conditions  remains  experimental. 
However,  reprogramming  technology  offers  the  potential  for  using 
readily  obtained  hematopoietic  cells  as  a  source  for  cells  with  other 
capabilities. Active areas of investigation are to use reprogrammed cells 
to generate mature lymphoid cells for immuno-oncology applications 
or red cells and platelets to overcome dependency on blood donors.

STEM CELLS AS TARGETS OF GENE 
THERAPY
Tools to alter gene sequence, expression, and regulation are becoming 
increasingly feasible. The hematopoietic stem cell is a target for a wide 
range  of  interventions.  Lentiviral,  retroviral,  and  adenoviral  vectors 
are  being  used  to  replace  defective  genes  (e.g.,  in  primary  immuno-
deficiency  diseases).  Antisense  technology  is  being  applied  to  block 
gene  expression  (e.g.,  blocking  the  Bcl11a  repression  of  fetal  globin 
expression  in  sickle  cell  disease  and  thalassemia).  CRISPR/Cas  tech-
nology is being applied to repair abnormal gene sequences. Precision 
genetic manipulations are expanding, and the hematopoietic system is 
central to it.

In sum, the stem cell has tremendous healing capacity and is essential 
for life. However, if dysregulated, it can threaten the life it maintains. 
Understanding  how  stem  cells  function,  the  signals  that  modify  their 
behavior,  and  the  tissue  niches  that  modulate  stem  cell  responses  to 
injury and disease is critical for more effectively developing stem cell–
based medicines.

97 Iron Deficiency and Other 
Hypoproliferative Anemias
John W. Adamson

Anemias  associated  with  normocytic  and  normochromic  red  cells 
and  an  inappropriately  low  reticulocyte  response  (reticulocyte  index 
<2–2.5) are hypoproliferative anemias. This category includes early iron 
deficiency  (before  hypochromic  microcytic  red  cells  develop),  acute 
and  chronic  inflammation  (including  many  malignancies),  renal  dis-
ease, hypometabolic states such as protein malnutrition and endocrine

deficiencies,  and  anemias  from  marrow  damage.  Marrow  damage 
states are discussed in Chap. 102.

Hypoproliferative  anemias  are  the  most  common  anemias,  and  in 
the  clinic,  iron  deficiency  anemia  is  the  most  common  of  these  fol-
lowed  by  the  anemia  of  inflammation.  The  anemia  of  inflammation, 
similar to iron deficiency, is related in part to abnormal iron metabo-
lism. The anemias associated with renal disease, inflammation, cancer, 
and hypometabolic states are characterized by a suboptimal erythro-
poietin response to the anemia.

IRON METABOLISM
Iron  is  a  critical  element  in  the  function  of  all  cells,  although  the 
amount of iron required by individual tissues varies during develop-
ment.  At  the  same  time,  the  body  must  protect  itself  from  free  iron, 
which is highly toxic in that it participates in chemical reactions that 
generate free radicals such as singlet O2 or OH–. Consequently, elabo-
rate mechanisms have evolved that allow iron to be made available for 
physiologic functions while at the same time conserving this element 
and handling it in such a way that toxicity is avoided.

The major role of iron in mammals is to carry O2 as part of hemo-
globin.  O2  is  also  bound  by  myoglobin  in  muscle.  Iron  is  a  critical 
element in iron-containing enzymes, including the cytochrome system 
in mitochondria. Iron distribution in the body is shown in Table 97-1. 
Without iron, cells lose their capacity for electron transport and energy 
metabolism.  In  erythroid  cells,  hemoglobin  synthesis  is  impaired, 
resulting in anemia and reduced O2 delivery to tissue.

FIGURE  97-1  Internal  iron  exchange.  Normally  80%  of  iron  passing  through  the 
plasma transferrin pool is recycled from senescent red cells. Absorption of ∼1 mg/d 
is required from the diet in men, and 1.4 mg/d in women to maintain homeostasis. As 
long as transferrin saturation is maintained between 20 and 60% and erythropoiesis 
is not increased, use of iron stores is not required. However, in the event of blood 
loss, dietary iron deficiency, or inadequate iron absorption, up to 40 mg/d of iron can 
be mobilized from stores. RE, reticuloendothelial.

in the plasma bound to transferrin, the iron transport protein. Trans-
ferrin is a bilobed glycoprotein with two iron-binding sites. Transfer-
rin that carries iron exists in two forms—monoferric (one iron atom) 
or  diferric  (two  iron  atoms).  The  turnover  (half-clearance  time)  of  
transferrin-bound  iron  is  very  rapid—typically  60–90  min.  Because 
almost all of the iron transported by transferrin is delivered to the ery-
throid marrow, the clearance time of transferrin-bound iron from the 
circulation is affected most by the plasma iron level and the erythroid 
marrow activity. When erythropoiesis is markedly stimulated, the pool 
of  erythroid  cells  requiring  iron  increases,  and  the  clearance  time  of 
iron from the circulation decreases. The half-clearance time of iron in 
the presence of iron deficiency is as short as 10–15 min. With suppres-
sion of erythropoiesis, the plasma iron level typically increases, and the 
half-clearance time may be prolonged to several hours. Normally, the 
iron  bound  to  transferrin  turns  over  6–8  times  per  day.  Assuming  a 
normal plasma iron level of 80–100 μg/dL, the amount of iron passing 
through the transferrin pool is 20–24 mg/day.

The  iron-transferrin  complex  circulates  in  the  plasma  until  it 
interacts  with  specific  transferrin  receptors  on  the  surface  of  marrow 
erythroid cells. Diferric transferrin has the highest affinity for transfer-
rin receptors; apotransferrin (not carrying iron) has very little affinity. 
Although  transferrin  receptors  are  found  on  cells  in  many  tissues 
within the body—and all cells at some time during development will 
display  transferrin  receptors—the  cell  having  the  greatest  number  of 
receptors (300,000–400,000/cell) is the developing erythroblast.

Once  the  iron-bearing  transferrin  interacts  with  its  receptor,  the 
complex is internalized via clathrin-coated pits and transported to an 
acidic endosome, where the iron is released at the low pH. The iron is 
then made available for heme synthesis while the transferrin-receptor 
complex  is  recycled  to  the  surface  of  the  cell,  where  the  bulk  of  the 
transferrin is released back into circulation and the transferrin receptor 
re-anchors into the cell membrane. At this point, a certain amount of 
the  transferrin  receptor  protein  may  be  released  into  circulation  and 
can  be  measured  as  soluble  transferrin  receptor  protein.  Within  the 
erythroid  cell,  iron  in  excess  of  the  amount  needed  for  hemoglobin 
synthesis binds to a storage protein, apoferritin, forming ferritin. This 
mechanism of iron exchange also takes place in other cells of the body 
expressing  transferrin  receptors,  especially  liver  parenchymal  cells 
where the iron can be incorporated into heme-containing enzymes or 
stored. The iron incorporated into hemoglobin subsequently enters the 
circulation  as  new  red  cells  are  released  from  the  bone  marrow.  The 
iron is then part of the red cell mass and will not become available for 
reutilization until the red cell dies.

In  a  normal  individual,  the  average  red  cell  life  span  is  120  days. 
Thus, 0.8–1% of red cells are replaced each day. At the end of its life 
span,  the  red  cell  is  recognized  as  senescent  by  the  cells  of  the  retic-
uloendothelial  (RE)  system,  and  the  red  cell  undergoes  phagocytosis. 
Once within the RE cell, the ingested hemoglobin is broken down, the 
globin and other proteins are returned to the amino acid pool, and the 
iron is shuttled back to the surface of the RE cell, where it is presented 
to circulating transferrin via the iron export channel, ferroportin. It is 
the efficient and highly conserved recycling of iron from senescent red 
cells that supports steady-state (and even accelerated) erythropoiesis.

Because each milliliter of red cells contains 1 mg of elemental iron, 
the amount of iron needed to replace those red cells lost through senes-
cence amounts to 20 mg/d (assuming an adult with a red cell mass of 
2 L). Any additional iron required for daily red cell production comes 
from  the  diet.  Normally,  an  adult  male  will  need  to  absorb  at  least  
1 mg of elemental iron daily to meet needs, while females in the child-
bearing  years  will  need  to  absorb  an  average  of  1.4  mg/d.  However, 
to  achieve  a  maximum  proliferative  erythroid  marrow  response  to 
anemia, additional iron must be available. With markedly stimulated 
erythropoiesis, demands for iron are increased by as much as six- to 
eightfold.  With  extravascular  hemolytic  anemia,  the  rate  of  red  cell 
destruction  is  increased,  but  the  iron  recovered  from  the  red  cells  is 
efficiently reutilized for hemoglobin synthesis. In contrast, with intra-
vascular hemolysis or blood loss anemia, the rate of red cell production 
is  limited  by  the  amount  of  iron  that  can  be  mobilized  from  stores. 
Typically, the rate of mobilization under these circumstances will not

support red cell production more than 2.5 times normal. If the delivery 
of  iron  to  the  stimulated  marrow  is  suboptimal,  the  marrow’s  prolif-
erative  response  is  blunted,  and  hemoglobin  synthesis  is  impaired. 
The result is a hypoproliferative marrow accompanied by microcytic, 
hypochromic anemia.

Whereas blood loss or hemolysis places a demand on the iron sup-
ply,  inflammatory  conditions  interfere  with  iron  release  from  stores 
and can result in a rapid decrease in the serum iron (see below).

 ■ NUTRITIONAL IRON BALANCE
The  balance  of  iron  in  humans  is  tightly  controlled  and  designed  to 
conserve iron for reutilization. There is no regulated excretory pathway 
for iron, and the only mechanisms by which iron is lost are blood loss 
(via gastrointestinal bleeding, menses, or other forms of bleeding) and 
the loss of epithelial cells from the skin, gut, and genitourinary tract. 
Normally,  the  only  route  by  which  iron  comes  into  the  body  is  via 
absorption from food or from medicinal iron taken orally. Iron may also 
enter the body through red cell transfusions or injection of iron com-
plexes. The margin between the amount of iron available for absorption 
and the requirement for iron in growing infants and the adult female 
is  narrow;  this  accounts  for  the  great  prevalence  of  iron  deficiency  
worldwide—currently estimated at more than one billion people.

The  amount  of  iron  required  from  the  diet  to  replace  losses  aver-
ages ∼10% of body iron content a year in men and 15% in women of 
childbearing age. Dietary iron content is closely related to total caloric 
intake (∼6 mg of elemental iron per 1000 calories). Iron bioavailability 
is affected by the nature of the foodstuff, with heme iron (e.g., red meat) 
being  most  readily  absorbed.  In  the  United  States,  the  average  iron 
intake in an adult male is 15 mg/d with 6% absorption; for the average 
female, the intake is 11 mg/d with 12% absorption. An individual with 
iron deficiency can increase iron absorption to ∼20% of the iron pres-
ent in a meat-containing diet but only 5–10% of the iron in a vegetarian 
diet. As a result, one-third of the female population in the United States 
has virtually no iron stores. Vegetarians are at an additional disadvan-
tage  because  certain  foodstuffs  that  include  phytates  and  phosphates 
reduce iron absorption by ∼50%. When ionizable iron salts are given 
together with food, the amount of iron absorbed is reduced. When the 
percentage  of  iron  absorbed  from  individual  food  items  is  compared 
with  the  percentage  for  an  equivalent  amount  of  ferrous  salt,  iron  in 
vegetables is only about one-twentieth as available, egg iron one-eighth, 
liver iron one-half, and heme iron one-half to two-thirds.

Infants, children, and adolescents may be unable to maintain nor-
mal  iron  balance  because  of  the  demands  of  body  growth  and  lower 
dietary  intake  of  iron.  During  the  last  two  trimesters  of  pregnancy, 
daily iron requirements increase to 5–6 mg, and iron supplements are 
strongly recommended for pregnant women in developed countries.

Iron absorption takes place largely in the duodenum and proximal 
small intestine and is a carefully regulated process. For absorption, iron 
must be taken up by the luminal cell. That process is facilitated by the 
acidic contents of the stomach, which maintains the iron in solution. 
At the brush border of the absorptive cell, the ferric iron is converted 
to  the  ferrous  form  by  a  ferrireductase.  Transport  across  the  mem-
brane  is  accomplished  by  divalent  metal  transporter  type  1  (DMT-1, 
also known as natural resistance macrophage-associated protein type 
2 [Nramp 2] or DCT-1). DMT-1 is a general cation transporter. Once 
inside the gut cell, iron may be stored as ferritin or transported through 
the cell to be released at the basolateral surface to plasma transferrin 
through  the  membrane-embedded  iron  exporter,  ferroportin.  The 
function  of  ferroportin  is  negatively  regulated  by  hepcidin,  the  prin-
cipal iron regulatory hormone. In the process of release, iron interacts 
with  another  ferroxidase,  hephaestin,  which  oxidizes  the  iron  to  the 
ferric form for transferrin binding. Hephaestin is similar to ceruloplas-
min, the copper-carrying protein.

Iron  absorption  is  influenced  by  a  number  of  physiologic  states. 
Erythroid  hyperplasia  stimulates  iron  absorption  even  in  the  face  of 
normal or increased iron stores, and hepcidin levels are inappropriately 
low. Thus, patients with anemias associated with high levels of ineffec-
tive erythropoiesis absorb excess amounts of dietary iron. The molec-
ular  mechanism  underlying  this  is  the  production  of  erythroferrone

(ERFE)  by  developing  erythroblasts.  ERFE  suppresses  hepcidin  pro-
duction, and over time, this may lead to iron overload and tissue dam-
age. In iron deficiency, hepcidin levels are also low and iron is much 
more efficiently absorbed; the contrary is true in states of secondary 
iron overload. The normal individual can reduce iron absorption in sit-
uations of excessive intake or medicinal iron intake; however, while the 
percentage of iron absorbed goes down, the absolute amount goes up. 
This accounts for the acute iron toxicity occasionally seen when chil-
dren ingest large numbers of iron tablets. Under these circumstances, 
the amount of iron absorbed exceeds the transferrin binding capacity 
of the plasma, resulting in free iron that affects critical organs such as 
cardiac muscle cells.

IRON-DEFICIENCY ANEMIA
Iron  deficiency  is  one  of  the  most  prevalent  forms  of  malnutrition. 
Globally, 50% of anemia is attributable to iron deficiency and accounts 
for approximately nearly a million deaths annually worldwide. Africa 
and  parts  of  Asia  bear  71%  of  the  global  mortality  burden;  North 
America  represents  only  1.4%  of  the  total  morbidity  and  mortality 
associated with iron deficiency.
 ■ STAGES OF IRON DEFICIENCY
The  progression  to  iron  deficiency  can  be  divided  into  three  stages  
(Fig.  97-2).  The  first  stage  is  negative  iron  balance,  in  which  the 
demands for (or losses of) iron exceed the body’s ability to absorb iron 
from the diet. This stage results from a number of physiologic mech-
anisms,  including  blood  loss,  pregnancy  (in  which  the  demands  for 
red cell production by the fetus outstrip the mother’s ability to provide 
iron),  rapid  growth  spurts  in  the  adolescent,  or  inadequate  dietary 
iron  intake.  Blood  loss  in  excess  of  10–20  mL  of  red  cells  per  day  is 
greater than the amount of iron that the gut can absorb from a normal 
diet. Under these circumstances, the iron deficit must be made up by 
mobilization  of  iron  from  RE  storage  sites.  During  this  period,  iron 
stores—reflected by the serum ferritin level or the appearance of stain-
able iron on bone marrow aspirations—decrease. As long as iron stores 
are present and can be mobilized, the serum iron, total iron-binding

FIGURE 97-2  Laboratory studies in the evolution of iron deficiency. Measurements 
of  marrow  iron  stores,  serum  ferritin,  and  total  iron-binding  capacity  (TIBC)  are 
sensitive to early iron-store depletion. Iron-deficient erythropoiesis is recognized 
from additional abnormalities in the serum iron (SI), percent transferrin saturation, 
the  pattern  of  marrow  sideroblasts,  and  the  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  protoporphyrin 
level. Patients with iron-deficiency anemia demonstrate all the same abnormalities 
plus hypochromic microcytic anemia. (Based on RS Hillman, CA Finch: The Red Cell 
Manual, 7th ed. Philadelphia, F.A. Davis and Co, 1996.)

capacity (TIBC), and red cell protoporphyrin levels remain within nor-
mal limits. At this stage, red cell morphology and indices are normal.

When  iron  stores  become  depleted,  the  serum  iron  begins  to  fall. 
Gradually,  the  TIBC  increases,  as  do  red  cell  protoporphyrin  levels. 
By definition, marrow iron stores are absent when the serum ferritin 
level is <15 μg/L. As long as the serum iron remains within the normal 
range, hemoglobin synthesis is unaffected despite the dwindling iron 
stores.  Once  the  transferrin  saturation  falls  to  15–20%,  hemoglobin 
synthesis becomes impaired. This is a period of iron-deficient erythro-
poiesis.  Careful  evaluation  of  the  peripheral  blood  smear  reveals  the 
first  appearance  of  microcytic  cells,  and  if  the  laboratory  technology 
is available, one finds hypochromic reticulocytes in circulation. Grad-
ually, the hemoglobin begins to fall, reflecting iron-deficiency anemia. 
The transferrin saturation at this point is <10–15%.

When  moderate  anemia  is  present  (hemoglobin  10–13  g/dL),  the 
bone  marrow  remains  hypoproliferative.  With  more  severe  anemia 
(hemoglobin 7–8 g/dL), hypochromia and microcytosis become more 
prominent, target cells and misshapen red cells (poikilocytes) appear 
on the blood smear as cigar- or pencil-shaped forms, and the erythroid 
marrow  becomes  increasingly  ineffective.  Consequently,  with  severe 
prolonged  iron-deficiency  anemia,  erythroid  hyperplasia  of  the  mar-
row develops, rather than hypoproliferation.
 ■ CAUSES OF IRON DEFICIENCY
Conditions that increase demand for iron, increase iron loss, or decrease 
iron intake or absorption can produce iron deficiency (Table 97-2).
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF IRON DEFICIENCY
Certain  clinical  conditions  carry  an  increased  likelihood  of  iron 
deficiency.  Pregnancy,  adolescence,  periods  of  rapid  growth,  and  an 
intermittent history of blood loss of any kind should alert the clinician 
to  possible  iron  deficiency.  A  cardinal  rule  is  that  the  appearance  of 
iron  deficiency  in  an  adult  male  or  postmenopausal  female  means 
gastrointestinal  blood  loss  until  proven  otherwise.  Signs  related  to 
iron  deficiency  depend  on  the  severity  and  chronicity  of  the  anemia 
in addition to the usual signs of anemia—fatigue, pallor, and reduced 
exercise capacity. Cheilosis (fissures at the corners of the mouth) and 
koilonychia (spooning of the fingernails) are signs of advanced tissue 
iron deficiency. The diagnosis of iron deficiency is typically based on 
laboratory results.
 ■ LABORATORY IRON STUDIES
Serum Iron and Total Iron-Binding Capacity  The serum iron 
level  represents  the  amount  of  circulating  iron  bound  to  transferrin. 
The  TIBC  is  an  indirect  measure  of  the  circulating  transferrin.  The 
normal  range  for  the  serum  iron  is  50–150  μg/dL;  the  normal  range 
for TIBC is 300–360 μg/dL. Transferrin saturation, which is normally 
25–50%,  is  obtained  by  the  following  formula:  serum  iron  ×  100  ÷

TIBC. Iron-deficiency states are associated with saturation levels <20%. 
There is a diurnal variation in the serum iron. A transferrin saturation 
>50% indicates that a disproportionate amount of the iron bound to 
transferrin is being delivered to nonerythroid tissues. If this persists for 
an extended time, tissue iron overload may occur.

Serum Ferritin  Free iron is toxic to cells, and the body has estab-
lished an elaborate set of protective mechanisms to bind iron in various 
tissue compartments. Within cells, iron is stored complexed to protein 
as ferritin or hemosiderin. Apoferritin binds to free ferrous iron and 
stores it in the ferric state. As ferritin accumulates within cells of the RE 
system, protein aggregates are formed as hemosiderin. Iron in ferritin 
or hemosiderin can be extracted for release by the RE cells, although 
hemosiderin  is  less  readily  available.  Under  steady-state  conditions, 
the serum ferritin level correlates with total body iron stores; thus, the 
serum ferritin level is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate 
iron stores. The normal value for ferritin varies according to the age 
and  gender  of  the  individual  (Fig.  97-3).  Adult  males  have  serum 
ferritin values averaging 100 μg/L, while adult females have levels aver-
aging 30 μg/L. As iron stores are depleted, the serum ferritin falls to  
<15 μg/L. Such levels are diagnostic of absent body iron stores.

Evaluation  of  Bone  Marrow  Iron  Stores  Although  RE  iron 
stores can be estimated from the iron stain of a bone marrow aspirate 
or  biopsy,  the  measurement  of  serum  ferritin  has  largely  supplanted 
these procedures for determination of storage iron (Table 97-3). The 
serum  ferritin  level  is  a  better  indicator  of  iron  overload  than  the 
marrow iron stain. However, in addition to storage iron, the marrow 
iron stain provides information about the effective delivery of iron to 
developing erythroblasts. Normally, when the marrow smear is stained 
for iron, 20–40% of developing erythroblasts—called sideroblasts—will 
have visible ferritin granules in their cytoplasm. This represents iron 
in excess of that needed for hemoglobin synthesis. In states in which

release of iron from storage sites is blocked, RE iron will be detectable, 
and  there  will  be  few  or  no  sideroblasts.  In  the  myelodysplastic  syn-
dromes,  mitochondrial  dysfunction  can  occur,  and  accumulation  of 
iron in mitochondria appears in a necklace fashion around the nucleus 
of the erythroblast. Such cells are referred to as ring sideroblasts.

Red  Cell  Protoporphyrin  Levels  Protoporphyrin  is  an  inter-
mediate in the pathway to heme synthesis. Under conditions in which 
heme  synthesis  is  impaired,  protoporphyrin  accumulates  within  the 
red cell. This reflects an inadequate iron supply to erythroid precursors 
to support hemoglobin synthesis. Normal values are <30 μg/dL of red 
cells. In iron deficiency, values >100 μg/dL are seen. The most common 
causes of increased red cell protoporphyrin levels are absolute or rela-
tive iron deficiency and lead poisoning.

Serum Levels of Transferrin Receptor Protein  Because  ery-
throid  cells  have  the  highest  numbers  of  transferrin  receptors  of  any 
cell  in  the  body,  and  because  transferrin  receptor  protein  (TRP)  is 
released  by  cells  into  the  circulation,  serum  levels  of  TRP  reflect  the 
total erythroid marrow mass. Another condition in which TRP levels 
are  elevated  is  absolute  iron  deficiency.  Normal  values  are  4–9  μg/L 
determined by immunoassay. This laboratory test is becoming increas-
ingly available and, along with the serum ferritin, has been proposed 
to distinguish between iron deficiency and the anemia of inflammation 
(see below).
 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Other than iron deficiency, only three conditions need to be consid-
ered in the differential diagnosis of a hypochromic microcytic anemia 
(Table 97-4). The first is an inherited defect in globin chain synthesis: 
the  thalassemias.  These  are  differentiated  from  iron  deficiency  most 
readily  by  serum  iron  values;  normal  or  increased  serum  iron  levels 
and  transferrin  saturation  are  characteristic  of  the  thalassemias.  In 
addition, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) index is gener-
ally normal in thalassemia and elevated in iron deficiency.

The  second  condition  is  the  anemia  of  inflammation  (AI;  also 
referred  to  as  the  anemia  of  chronic  disease)  with  inadequate  iron 
supply  to  the  erythroid  marrow.  The  distinction  between  true  iron- 
deficiency anemia and AI is among the most common diagnostic prob-
lems encountered by clinicians (see below). Usually, AI is normocytic 
and normochromic. The iron values usually make the differential diag-
nosis clear, as the ferritin level is normal or increased and the percent 
transferrin saturation and TIBC are typically below normal.

Finally,  the  myelodysplastic  syndromes  represent  the  third  and 
least  common  condition.  Occasionally,  patients  with  myelodysplasia 
have impaired hemoglobin synthesis with mitochondrial dysfunction, 
resulting  in  impaired  iron  incorporation  into  heme.  The  iron  values 
again  reveal  normal  stores  and  more  than  an  adequate  supply  to  the 
marrow, despite the microcytosis and hypochromia.

TREATMENT
Iron-Deficiency Anemia

The  severity  and  cause  of  iron-deficiency  anemia  will  determine 
the  appropriate  approach  to  treatment.  As  an  example,  symp-
tomatic  elderly  patients  with  severe  iron-deficiency  anemia  and

cardiovascular instability may require red cell transfusions. Younger 
individuals who have compensated for their anemia can be treated 
more conservatively with iron replacement. The foremost issue for 
the latter patient is the precise identification of the cause of the iron 
deficiency.

For  the  majority  of  cases  of  iron  deficiency  (pregnant  women, 
growing children and adolescents, patients with infrequent episodes 
of bleeding, and those with inadequate dietary intake of iron), oral 
iron  therapy  will  suffice.  For  patients  with  unusual  blood  loss  or 
malabsorption,  specific  diagnostic  tests  and  appropriate  therapy 
take priority. Once the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia and its 
cause is made, there are three major therapeutic approaches. 
RED CELL TRANSFUSION
Transfusion therapy is reserved for individuals who have symptoms 
of anemia, cardiovascular instability, and continued and excessive 
blood loss from whatever source and who require immediate inter-
vention. The management of these patients is less related to the iron 
deficiency than it is to the consequences of the severe anemia. Not 
only do transfusions correct the anemia acutely, but the transfused 
red  cells  provide  a  source  of  iron  for  reutilization,  assuming  they 
are not lost through continued bleeding. Transfusion therapy will 
stabilize the patient while other options are reviewed. 
ORAL IRON THERAPY
In the asymptomatic patient with established iron-deficiency ane-
mia and an intact gastrointestinal tract, treatment with oral iron is 
usually adequate. Encouraging dietary intake of iron-rich foods is 
also useful. Such foods include oysters, kidney beans, beef liver, tofu, 
beef (chuck roast, lean ground beef), turkey leg, whole-wheat bread, 
tuna,  eggs,  shrimp,  peanut  butter,  leg  of  lamb,  brown  rice,  raisin 
bran  (whole  grain–enriched  cereals),  lentils,  and  beans.  Multiple 
preparations  of  oral  iron  supplements  are  available,  ranging  from 
simple iron salts to complex iron compounds designed for sustained 
release  throughout  the  small  intestine  (Table  97-5).  Although  the 
various  preparations  contain  different  amounts  of  iron,  they  are 
generally  all  absorbed  well  and  are  effective  in  treatment.  Some 
come  with  other  compounds  designed  to  enhance  iron  absorp-
tion,  such  as  ascorbic  acid.  It  is  not  clear  whether  the  benefits  of 
such compounds justify their costs. Typically, for iron replacement 
therapy,  up  to  200  mg  of  elemental  iron  per  day  is  given,  usually

as three or four iron tablets (each containing 50–65 mg elemental 
iron) given over the course of the day. Ideally, oral iron preparations 
should be taken on an empty stomach, since food may inhibit iron 
absorption. Some patients with gastric disease or prior gastric sur-
gery require special treatment with iron solutions because the reten-
tion capacity of the stomach may be reduced. The retention capacity 
is  necessary  for  dissolving  the  shell  of  the  iron  tablet  before  the 
release of iron. A dose of 200 mg of elemental iron per day should 
result in the absorption of iron up to 50 mg/d. This supports a red 
cell production level of two to three times normal in an individual 
with  a  normally  functioning  marrow  and  appropriate  erythropoi-
etin (EPO) stimulus. However, as the hemoglobin level rises, EPO 
stimulation decreases, and the amount of iron absorbed is reduced. 
The  goal  of  therapy  in  individuals  with  iron-deficiency  anemia  is 
not only to repair the anemia, but also to provide stores of at least 
0.5–1  g  of  iron.  Sustained  treatment  for  a  period  of  6–12  months 
after correction of the anemia will be necessary to achieve this.

Of  the  complications  of  oral  iron  therapy,  gastrointestinal  dis-
tress  is  the  most  prominent  and  is  seen  in  at  least  15–20%  of 
patients.  Abdominal  pain,  nausea,  vomiting,  or  constipation  may 
lead to noncompliance. Although small doses of iron or iron prep-
arations with delayed release may help somewhat, the gastrointes-
tinal side effects are a major impediment to the effective treatment 
of a number of patients.

The  response  to  iron  therapy  varies,  depending  on  the  EPO 
stimulus  and  the  rate  of  absorption.  Typically,  the  reticulocyte 
count should begin to increase within 4–7 days after initiation of 
therapy and peak at 1–1½ weeks. The absence of a response may 
be due to poor absorption, noncompliance (which is common), or 
a  confounding  diagnosis.  A  useful  test  in  the  clinic  to  determine 
the  patient’s  ability  to  absorb  iron  is  the  iron  tolerance  test.  Two 
iron tablets are given to the patient on an empty stomach, and the 
serum iron is measured serially over the subsequent 2–3 h. Normal 
absorption  will  result  in  an  increase  in  the  serum  iron  of  at  least   
100 μg/dL. If iron deficiency persists despite adequate treatment, it 
may be necessary to switch to parenteral iron therapy. 

PARENTERAL IRON THERAPY
Intravenous iron can be given to patients who are unable to tolerate 
oral iron; whose needs are relatively acute; or who need iron on an 
ongoing  basis,  usually  due  to  persistent  gastrointestinal  or  men-
strual  blood  loss.  Parenteral  iron  use  has  been  increasing  rapidly 
over  the  past  several  years  with  the  recognition  that  recombinant 
EPO therapy induces a large demand for iron—a demand that fre-
quently cannot be met through the physiologic release of iron from 
RE  sources  or  oral  iron  absorption.  The  safety  of  parenteral  iron 
has been a concern largely driven by the high adverse reaction rate 
to high-molecular-weight iron dextran. The newer iron complexes 
that  are  available,  such  as  ferumoxytol  (Feraheme),  sodium  ferric 
gluconate (Ferrlecit), iron sucrose (Venofer), low-molecular-weight 
(LMW)  iron  dextran  (InFed),  ferric  derisomaltose  (Monoferric), 
and  ferric  carboxymaltose  (Injectafer),  have  much  lower  rates  of 
adverse effects. Ferumoxytol delivers 510 mg of iron per infusion; 
ferric  gluconate  125  mg  per  infusion;  LMW  iron  dextran  up  to   
1500  mg  per  infusion;  ferric  carboxymaltose  750  mg  per  infu-
sion; ferric derisomaltose 1000 mg per infusion; and iron sucrose  
200 mg per infusion.

Parenteral  iron  is  used  in  two  ways:  one  is  to  administer  the 
total  dose  of  iron  required  to  correct  the  hemoglobin  deficit  and 
provide the patient with at least 500 mg of iron stores; the second 
is to give repeated small doses of parenteral iron over a protracted 
period. The latter approach is common in dialysis centers, where it 
is not unusual for 100 mg of elemental iron to be given weekly for  
10  weeks  to  augment  the  response  to  recombinant  EPO  therapy. 
The amount of iron needed by an individual patient is calculated by 
the following formula:

Body weight (kg) × 2.3 × (15 – patient’s hemoglobin, g/dL)  
+ 500 or 1000 mg (for stores)

In  administering  any  intravenous  iron  preparation,  anaphylaxis 
is  a  concern.  Anaphylaxis  is  much  rarer  with  the  newer  prepara-
tions.  The  factors  that  have  correlated  with  an  anaphylactic-like 
reaction  include  a  history  of  multiple  allergies  or  a  prior  allergic 
reaction  to  an  iron  preparation.  Generalized  symptoms  appearing 
several  days  after  the  infusion  of  a  large  dose  of  iron  can  include 
arthralgias,  skin  rash,  and  low-grade  fever.  These  may  be  dose- 
related, but they do not preclude the further use of parenteral iron in 
the patient. To date, patients with sensitivity to one iron preparation 
have been safely treated with other parenteral iron preparations. If a 
large dose of LMW iron dextran is to be given (>100 mg), the iron 
preparation should be diluted in 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% NaCl 
solution. The iron solution can then be infused over a 60- to 90-min 
period (for larger doses) or at a rate convenient for the attending nurse 
or physician. Although a test dose (25 mg) of parenteral LMW iron 
dextran is recommended, in reality, a slow infusion of a larger dose 
of parenteral iron solution will afford the same kind of early warning 
as a separately injected test dose. Early in the infusion of iron, if chest 
pain, wheezing, a fall in blood pressure, or other systemic symptoms 
occur, the infusion of iron should be stopped immediately.

OTHER HYPOPROLIFERATIVE ANEMIAS
In  addition  to  mild  to  moderate  iron-deficiency  anemia,  the  hypo-
proliferative  anemias  can  be  divided  into  four  categories:  (1)  chronic 
inflammation, (2) renal disease, (3) endocrine and nutritional deficien-
cies (hypometabolic states), and (4) marrow damage (Chap. 102). With 
chronic inflammation, renal disease, or hypometabolism, endogenous 
EPO  production  is  inadequate  for  the  degree  of  anemia  observed. 
For  the  anemia  of  chronic  inflammation,  the  erythroid  marrow  also 
responds  inadequately  to  stimulation,  due  in  part  to  defective  iron 
reutilization.  As  a  result  of  the  lack  of  adequate  EPO  stimulation, 
an  examination  of  the  peripheral  blood  smear  will  disclose  only  an 
occasional  polychromatophilic  (“shift”)  reticulocyte.  In  cases  of  iron 
deficiency  or  marrow  damage,  appropriate  elevations  in  endogenous 
EPO levels are typically found, and shift reticulocytes will be present 
on the blood smear.

 ■ ANEMIA OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC 
INFLAMMATION/INFECTION (AI)
AI,  which  encompasses  inflammation,  infection,  tissue  injury,  and 
conditions (e.g., cancer) associated with the release of proinflammatory 
cytokines, is one of the most common forms of anemia seen clinically. 
It  is  the  most  important  anemia  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  iron 
deficiency  because  many  of  the  features  of  the  anemia  are  brought 
about by inadequate iron delivery to the marrow, despite the presence 
of  normal  or  increased  iron  stores.  This  is  reflected  by  a  low  serum 
iron,  increased  red  cell  protoporphyrin,  a  hypoproliferative  mar-
row,  transferrin  saturation  in  the  range  of  15–20%,  and  a  normal  or 
increased serum ferritin. The serum ferritin values are often the most 
distinguishing  features  between  true  iron-deficiency  anemia  and  the 
iron-restricted erythropoiesis associated with inflammation. Typically, 
serum ferritin values increase threefold over basal levels in the face of 
inflammation.  These  changes  are  due  to  the  effects  of  inflammatory 
cytokines  and  hepcidin,  the  key  iron  regulatory  hormone,  acting  at 
several levels of erythropoiesis (Fig. 97-4).

Interleukin 1 (IL-1) directly decreases EPO production in response 
to  anemia.  IL-1,  acting  through  accessory  cell  release  of  interferon  γ 
(IFN-γ), suppresses the response of the erythroid marrow to EPO—an 
effect that can be overcome by EPO administration in vitro and in vivo. 
In  addition,  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF),  acting  through  the  release 
of  IFN-β  by  marrow  stromal  cells,  also  suppresses  the  response  to 
EPO. Hepcidin, made by the liver, is increased in inflammation via an 
IL-6–mediated pathway, and acts to suppress iron absorption and iron 
release from storage sites. The overall result is a chronic hypoprolifera-
tive anemia with classic changes in iron metabolism. The anemia is fur-
ther compounded by a mild to moderate shortening in red cell survival.
With  chronic  inflammation,  the  primary  disease  will  determine 
the  severity  and  characteristics  of  the  anemia.  For  example,  many

FIGURE  97-4  Suppression  of  erythropoiesis  by  inflammatory  cytokines.  Through

units [BFU/CFU-E]). The mediators in patients with vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis

patients with cancer also have anemia that is typically normocytic and 
normochromic.  In  contrast,  patients  with  long-standing  active  rheu-
matoid arthritis or chronic infections such as tuberculosis will have a 
microcytic,  hypochromic  anemia.  In  both  cases,  the  bone  marrow  is 
hypoproliferative, but the differences in red cell indices reflect differ-
ences in the availability of iron for hemoglobin synthesis. Occasionally, 
conditions  associated  with  chronic  inflammation  are  also  associated 
with chronic blood loss. Under these circumstances, the measurement 
of  soluble  transferrin  receptor  protein  may  be  necessary  to  rule  out 
absolute  iron  deficiency.  However,  the  administration  of  iron  in  this 
case  will  correct  the  iron-deficiency  component  of  the  anemia  and 
leave the inflammatory component unaffected.

The anemia associated with acute infection or inflammation is typ-
ically mild but becomes more pronounced over time. Acute infection 
can  produce  a  decrease  in  hemoglobin  levels  of  2–3  g/dL  within  1 
or 2 days; this is largely related to the hemolysis of red cells near the 
end of their natural life span. The fever and cytokines released exert a 
selective pressure against cells with more limited capacity to maintain 
the red cell membrane. In most individuals, the mild anemia is reason-
ably well tolerated, and symptoms, if present, are associated with the 
underlying  disease.  Occasionally,  in  patients  with  preexisting  cardiac 
disease, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 10–11 g/dL) may be associated 
with  angina,  exercise  intolerance,  and  shortness  of  breath.  The  ery-
thropoietic profile that distinguishes the anemia of inflammation from 
the other causes of hypoproliferative anemias is shown in Table 97-6.
 ■ ANEMIA OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD)
Progressive CKD is usually associated with a moderate to severe hypo-
proliferative anemia; the level of the anemia correlates with the stage 
of  CKD.  Red  cells  are  typically  normocytic  and  normochromic,  and 
reticulocytes  are  decreased.  The  anemia  is  primarily  due  to  a  failure 
of  EPO  production  by  the  diseased  kidney  and  a  reduction  in  red 
cell  survival.  In  certain  forms  of  acute  renal  failure,  the  correlation

between  the  anemia  and  renal  function  is  weaker.  Patients  with  the 
hemolytic-uremic syndrome increase erythropoiesis in response to the 
hemolysis,  despite  renal  failure.  Polycystic  kidney  disease  also  shows 
a  smaller  degree  of  EPO  deficiency  for  a  given  level  of  renal  failure. 
By contrast, patients with diabetes or myeloma have more severe EPO 
deficiency for a given level of renal failure.

Assessment  of  iron  status  provides  information  to  distinguish  the 
anemia  of  CKD  from  the  other  forms  of  hypoproliferative  anemia 
(Table  97-6)  and  to  guide  management.  Patients  with  the  anemia  of 
CKD usually present with normal serum iron, TIBC, and ferritin levels. 
However, those maintained on chronic hemodialysis may develop iron 
deficiency from blood loss through the dialysis procedure. Iron must 
be replenished in these patients to ensure an adequate response to EPO 
therapy (see below).
 ■ ANEMIA IN HYPOMETABOLIC STATES
Patients  who  are  starving,  particularly  for  protein,  and  those  with  a 
variety of endocrine disorders that produce lower metabolic rates, may 
develop  a  mild  to  moderate  hypoproliferative  anemia.  The  release  of 
EPO from the kidney is sensitive to the need for O2, not just O2 levels. 
Thus, EPO production is triggered at lower levels of blood O2 content 
in disease states (e.g., hypothyroidism and starvation) where metabolic 
activity, and thus O2 demand, is decreased.
Endocrine  Deficiency  States  The  difference  in  the  levels  of 
hemoglobin between men and women is related to the effects of andro-
gen and estrogen on erythropoiesis. Testosterone and anabolic steroids 
augment  erythropoiesis;  castration  and  estrogen  administration  to 
males  decrease  erythropoiesis.  Patients  who  are  hypothyroid  or  have 
deficits in pituitary hormones also may develop a mild anemia. Patho-
genesis may be complicated by other nutritional deficiencies because 
iron and folic acid absorption can be affected by these disorders. Usu-
ally, correction of the hormone deficiency reverses the anemia.

Anemia may be more severe in Addison’s disease, depending on the 
level of thyroid and androgen hormone dysfunction; however, anemia 
may be masked by decreases in plasma volume. Once such patients are 
given cortisol and volume replacement, the hemoglobin level may fall 
rapidly.  Mild  anemia  complicating  hyperparathyroidism  may  be  due 
to decreased EPO production as a consequence of the renal effects of 
hypercalcemia or to impaired proliferation of erythroid progenitors.

Protein Starvation  Decreased dietary intake of protein may lead 
to mild to moderate hypoproliferative anemia; this form of anemia may 
be prevalent in the elderly. The anemia can be more severe in patients 
with  a  greater  degree  of  starvation.  In  marasmus,  where  patients  are 
both protein- and calorie-deficient, the release of EPO is impaired in 
proportion to the reduction in metabolic rate; however, the degree of 
anemia  may  be  masked  by  volume  depletion  and  becomes  apparent 
after refeeding. Deficiencies in other nutrients (iron, folate) may also 
complicate the clinical picture but may not be apparent at diagnosis. 
Changes in the erythrocyte indices on refeeding should prompt evalu-
ation of iron, folate, and B12 status.
Anemia in Liver Disease  A  mild  hypoproliferative  anemia  may 
develop  in  patients  with  chronic  liver  disease  from  nearly  any  cause. 
The  peripheral  blood  smear  may  show  spur  cells  and  stomatocytes

from the accumulation of excess cholesterol in the membrane from a 
deficiency  of  lecithin-cholesterol  acyltransferase.  Red  cell  survival  is 
shortened,  and  the  production  of  EPO  is  inadequate  to  compensate. 
In  alcoholic  liver  disease,  nutritional  deficiencies  are  common  and 
complicate the management. Folate deficiency from inadequate intake, 
as well as iron deficiency from blood loss and inadequate intake, can 
alter the red cell indices.

 ■ ANEMIA IN AGING
Anemia is common in people over age 65 years. It has been estimated 
to  affect  ~11%  of  community-living  older  adults  and  up  to  40%  of 
nursing home residents. In at least one-third of these anemic people, a 
cause for the anemia is not found. Patients with the unexplained ane-
mia of aging do not have nutrient deficiency or renal dysfunction, and 
although older people can have an increase in systemic inflammatory 
cytokines (the inflammation of aging), the levels are not high enough 
to  mimic  the  anemia  of  chronic  inflammation.  If  hepcidin  levels  are 
elevated at all, they are minimally so.

Investigations into the cause(s) of this form of anemia have noted 
that EPO levels are generally in the normal range, that is, they are inap-
propriately  low  for  the  hemoglobin  level.  In  general,  in  older  people 
who maintain a normal hemoglobin level, EPO levels increase with age. 
This compensatory increase to maintain normal oxygen delivery seems 
to be due to a relative resistance to EPO stimulation; studies of red cell 
life span in older people have not noted a decrease in red cell survival. 
More data on the mechanism are needed.

The  importance  of  this  unexplained  anemia  of  aging  is  that  low 
hemoglobin levels are associated with increases in falls, hospitalizations, 
development of frailty, and mortality. It is not clear whether reversing 
the anemia would influence these increased risks. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that this form of anemia is responsive to exogenous EPO.

TREATMENT
Hypoproliferative Anemias

Many patients with hypoproliferative anemias experience recovery 
of normal hemoglobin levels when the underlying disease is appro-
priately treated. For those in whom such reversals are not possible—
such as patients with end-stage kidney disease, cancer, and chronic 
inflammatory  diseases—symptomatic  anemia  requires  treatment. 
The two major forms of treatment are transfusions and EPO. 
TRANSFUSIONS
Thresholds  for  transfusion  should  be  determined  based  on  the 
patient’s  symptoms.  In  general,  patients  without  serious  underly-
ing  cardiovascular  or  pulmonary  disease  can  tolerate  hemoglobin 
levels  above  7–8  g/dL  and  do  not  require  intervention  until  the 
hemoglobin  falls  below  that  level.  Patients  with  more  physiologic 
compromise may need to have their hemoglobin levels kept above 
11 g/dL. Usually, a unit of packed red cells increases the hemoglobin 
level by 1 g/dL. Transfusions are associated with certain infectious 
risks  (Chap.  113),  and  chronic  transfusions  can  produce  iron 
overload. Importantly, the liberal use of blood has been associated 
with  increased  morbidity  and  mortality,  particularly  in  the  inten-
sive  care  setting.  Therefore,  in  the  absence  of  documented  tissue 
hypoxia, a conservative approach to the use of red cell transfusions 
is preferable. 
ERYTHROPOIETIN
EPO  is  particularly  useful  in  anemias  in  which  endogenous  EPO 
levels are inappropriately low, such as CKD or AI. Iron status must 
be evaluated and iron replaced to obtain optimal effects from EPO. 
In patients with CKD, the usual dose of EPO is 50–150 U/kg three 
times  a  week  intravenously.  Hemoglobin  levels  of  10–12  g/dL 
are  usually  reached  within  4–6  weeks  if  iron  levels  are  adequate; 
90%  of  these  patients  respond.  Once  a  target  hemoglobin  level  is 
achieved, the EPO dose can be decreased. A decrease in hemoglo-
bin level occurring in the face of EPO therapy usually signifies the 
development of an infection or iron depletion. Aluminum toxicity 

and  hyperparathyroidism  can  also  compromise  the  response  to 
EPO. When an infection intervenes, it is best to interrupt the EPO 
therapy  and  rely  on  transfusions  to  correct  the  anemia  until  the 
infection is adequately treated. The dose of EPO needed to correct 
chemotherapy-induced  anemia  in  patients  with  cancer  is  higher, 
up  to  300  U/kg  three  times  a  week,  and  only  ∼60%  of  patients 
respond.  Because  of  evidence  that  there  is  an  increased  risk  of 
thromboembolic  complications  and  tumor  progression  with  EPO 
administration, the risks and benefits of using EPO in such patients 
must  be  weighed  carefully,  and  the  target  hemoglobin  should  be 
that necessary to avoid transfusions.

Longer-acting  preparations  of  EPO  can  reduce  the  frequency 
of injections. Darbepoetin alfa, a molecularly modified EPO with 
additional  carbohydrate,  has  a  half-life  in  the  circulation  that  is 
three to four times longer than recombinant human EPO, permit-
ting weekly or every other week dosing.

Orally bioavailable EPO mimetics such as roxadustat (usual dose 
50 mg PO thrice weekly) that act to increase the biological half-life 
of active hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) are demonstrating activity 
to increase hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic renal disease 
and other settings.

98 Disorders of Hemoglobin

Martin H. Steinberg

Hemoglobinopathies  affect  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  globin;  tha-
lassemia is a disorder of reduced globin biosynthesis. Together, these 
disorders of the hemoglobin molecule are our most common Mende-
lian genetic diseases. They are responsible for most cases of hemolytic 
anemia.  Sickle  cell  disease  and  the  hemoglobin  E  (HbE)–associated 
syndromes are the most prevalent hemoglobinopathies; β and α tha-
lassemia  are  the  most  prevalent  thalassemias.  In  addition  to  these 
common  disorders  of  hemoglobin,  rare  globin  mutations  can  cause 
hemoglobin instability, increased or decreased affinity of hemoglobin 
for oxygen (O2), and oxidized hemoglobin reducing O2 transport. O2 
transport by hemoglobin can also be reduced by exposure to carbon 
monoxide (CO) and some oxidizing agents (Table 98-1).

Phenotypic  diversity  among  hemoglobin  disorders  is  enormous. 
Mutations can be asymptomatic, for example in heterozygous carriers 
of  sickle  hemoglobin  (HbS)  and  thalassemia,  or  cause  intrauterine 
death  as  when  all  α-globin  genes  are  deleted.  Impressive  gains  in 
understanding  the  biological  basis  of  hemoglobinopathies  and  tha-
lassemia have led to novel therapeutics with the promise of improved 
patient outcomes.

HEMOGLOBIN
Easy access to erythrocytes to study hemoglobin structure and func-
tion, reticulocytes to examine hemoglobin biosynthesis, and leukocyte 
DNA  to  define  the  mutations  of  hemoglobin  and  the  availability  of 
hematopoietic  stem  and  progenitor  cells  from  blood  and  bone  mar-
row  have  placed  hemoglobin  disorders  in  the  forefront  of  molecular 
medicine. A review of the biology of hemoglobin provides the back-
ground for understanding the pathophysiology of its many genetic and 
acquired disorders and approaches to their treatment.
 ■ DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
Successive waves of erythropoiesis beginning in the yolk sac, moving to 
the fetal liver and bone marrow, and culminating in the adult marrow 
direct the synthesis of different hemoglobin molecules that result from 
sequential  activation  and  silencing  of  the  globin  genes  (Fig.  98-1).

Hemoglobin  is  a  tetramer  of  two  pairs  of  unlike  globin  polypeptide 
chains, each chain containing a tetrapyrrole heme group. O2 binds to 
heme as erythrocytes traverse the lungs and is released in the tissues. 
Heme is nestled within a protective pocket of each globin subunit.

 ■ GLOBIN GENE CLUSTERS
Globin is encoded in two nonallelic gene clusters. The β-globin gene 
cluster is on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.4); the α-globin 
gene cluster is on chromosome 16 (16p13.3) (Fig. 98-1). The β-globin 
gene  cluster  contains  an  embryonic  ε-globin  gene  (HBE),  two  nearly 
identical  fetal  γ-globin  genes  (HBG2,  HBG1)  a  major  adult  β-globin 
gene  (HBB),  and  a  minor  adult  δ-globin  gene  (HBD).  The  α-globin 
gene  cluster  contains  an  embryonic  ζ-globin  gene  (HBZ)  and  dupli-
cated  α-globin  genes  (HBA2,  HBA1)  with  identical  proteins.  Embry-
onic  hemoglobins  include  Gower  I  (ζ2ε2),  Gower  II  (α2ε2),  Portland  I 
(ζ2γ2), and Portland II (ζ2β2). Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) production 
begins at 6–8 weeks’ gestation, peaks during mid-gestation, then falls to 
<1% of total hemoglobin during the first 6 months of extrauterine life. 
Adult hemoglobin A (HbA; α2β2) production follows a pattern recip-
rocal to that of HbF. The hemoglobin composition of normal adults is 
>95% HbA, ~1% HbF, and 2–3% HbA2 (α2δ2). In adults, HbF and HbA2 
have little functional significance because of their low concentrations, 
although  they  can  be  diagnostically  important.  Hemoglobin  is  also 
subject  to  posttranslational  modifications,  the  most  important  being 
the  nonenzymatic  glycosylation  of  HbA  forming  the  adduct  HbA1c, 
which is of diagnostic utility in the management of diabetes mellitus.

 ■ HEMOGLOBIN STRUCTURE
All globin polypeptides have similar but not identical primary struc-
tures.  α-Globins  contain  141  amino  acids,  and  β-like  globins  have 
146  amino  acids.  This  primary  structure  dictates,  according  to  the 
constraints of protein folding, the secondary structure of globin into α- 
helical sections joined by small nonhelical stretches. Each globin chain 
folds into a tertiary conformation known as the globin fold, whereby 
charged  amino  acid  residues  face  the  exterior  of  the  molecules  and 
uncharged residues face the hydrophobic interior. The iron-containing  
tetrapyrrole  heme  moiety  is  protected  from  oxidation  and  located 
between two of the helical segments; O2 loading and unloading occur 
when heme iron is in its reduced ferrous form. Globin gene mutations 
affecting  critical  heme-binding  amino  acid  residues  allows  iron  to  be 
oxidized, forming methemoglobin, which has high O2 affinity and does 
not release O2 in tissues. Dimers of α- and non-α-globin chains reversibly 
assemble into tetramers, forming a quaternary structure.

 ■ HEMOGLOBIN FUNCTION
Hemoglobin  transports  O2  from  lungs  to  tissues  and  carbon  dioxide 
(CO2)  from  tissues  to  lungs  and  is  a  nitrate  reductase  that  releases 
nitric  oxide  (NO)  from  nitrite  to  promote  vasodilation.  Oxygen 
binding  is  defined  by  the  sigmoidal  shape  of  the  hemoglobin-O2 
dissociation  curve.  P50  is  a  point  on  this 
curve  that  indicates  the  partial  pressure 
of  O2  where  hemoglobin  is  half  satu-
rated (Fig. 98-2). The P50 is influenced by 
the  binding  of  2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 
a  product  of  glycolysis,  in  the  central 
cavity  of  hemoglobin,  and  by  pH  and 
temperature.  Normal  P50  is  ~26  mmHg; 
low  P50  indicates  that  hemoglobin  has 
high O2 affinity, decreasing O2 delivery to 
tissues; high P50 indicates that hemoglobin 
has  low  O2  affinity,  releasing  more  O2  to 
tissues. The conformation of hemoglobin 
fully saturated with O2 is known as the R 
or  relaxed  state;  desaturated  hemoglobin 
is  in  the  T  or  tense  state.  The  transition 
between T and R states occurs when two 
or  three  O2  molecules  are  bound.  Coop-
erativity describes the progressively more 
rapid binding of O2 once the first molecule

FIGURE  98-2  Hemoglobin-oxygen  dissociation  curve.  The  hemoglobin  tetramer 
can bind up to four molecules of oxygen (O2) in the iron-containing sites of the heme 
molecules. As O2 is bound, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) and carbon dioxide 
(CO2)  are  expelled.  Salt  bridges  are  broken,  and  each  of  the  globin  molecules 
changes  its  conformation  to  facilitate  O2  binding.  O2  release  to  the  tissues  is  the 
reverse  process,  with  salt  bridges  being  formed  and  2,3-BPG  and  CO2  bound. 
Deoxyhemoglobin  does  not  bind  O2  efficiently  until  the  cell  returns  to  conditions 
of higher pH, the most important modulator of O2 affinity (Bohr effect). When acid 
is produced in the tissues, the dissociation curve shifts to the right, facilitating O2 
release and CO2 binding. Alkalosis has the opposite effect, reducing O2 delivery.

is  bound.  Hemoglobin  variants  that  decrease  P50  are  characterized  by 
isolated  erythrocytosis  as  compensation  for  hypoxia;  variants  with 
increased P50 sometimes are accompanied by cyanosis and anemia as 
hemoglobin becomes unsaturated and O2 delivery is enhanced. Muta-
tions of residues critical for heme binding, R-T transitions, or tetramer 
stability cause hemoglobinopathies characterized by hemolytic anemia, 
methemoglobinemia, erythrocytosis and cyanosis.
 ■ GLOBIN GENE SWITCHING
The  sequential  activation  and  inactivation  of  globin  genes  dur-
ing  development  shown  in  Fig.  98-1  is  called  “hemoglobin  switch-
ing.”  Transcription  factors  along  with  epigenetic  elements  such  as 
DNA  methyltransferases  and  demethylases,  interact  with  enhancers 
“upstream” of the β-globin gene cluster that contact globin gene pro-
moters,  silencing  the  embryonic  and  fetal  genes.  Activation  of  fetal 
globin  gene  repressors  during  development  allows  expression  of  the 
adult genes. Developmental factors such as RNA-binding factors and 
microRNAs also impact hemoglobin switching.

β-Globin  Gene  Switching  HbF  reactivation  by  drugs  and  gene 
therapy is a prime therapeutic goal for treating the common disorders 
of  hemoglobin,  meriting  a  discussion  of  the  controls  of  HbF  gene 
silencing. An upstream super-enhancer called the β-globin locus con-
trol  region  (LCR)  binds  erythroid-specific  and  ubiquitous  transcrip-
tion  factors.  The  LCR  interacts  directly  with  globin  gene  promoters; 
transcription factors that silence and activate genes also interact with 
elements of the globin genes. Competition among the β-like genes for 
the LCR and autonomous silencing of the embryonic and fetal globin 
genes  depends  on  transcription  factors.  Silencing,  first  of  HBE  and 
then of HBG2 and HBG1, favors the interaction of the LCR with HBB. 
When HBG2 or HBG1 is upregulated by rare point mutations in their 
promoters, expression of the linked HBB is downregulated. Deletions 
of  the  HBB  promoter  remove  competition  for  the  LCR,  increasing 
the  expression  of  HBG2,  HBG1,  and  HBD.  The  transcription  factors 
BCL11A (2p16) and ZBTB7A (19p13) silence the HbF genes; BCL11A 
binds  to  the  HbF  gene  promoters,  repressing  them  and  silencing 
transcription;  ZBTB7A  binds  upstream  of  BCL11A  with  similar 

repressive effects. This accounts for the bulk of the switch from HbF 
to HbA. Mutations in these binding sites abolish the normal silencing 
of the HbF genes, leading to one type of the benign condition called 
hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Disruption of the 
BCL11A regulatory elements or the binding sites for BCL11A by gene 
editing is a prime therapeutic target for HbF induction.

α-Globin Gene Switching  A  less  complex  switch  takes  place  in 
the  α-globin  gene  cluster  where  a  regulatory  locus  of  four  elements 
termed  R1–R4  is  present  within  introns  of  the  gene  NPRL3  that  is 
upstream of HBA2. A developmental switch from embryonic ζ- to adult 
α-globin gene expression occurs at about 6 weeks’ gestation.

Modulation  of  HbF  Level  Variations  in  three  quantitative  trait 
loci  (QTL),  BCL11A,  MYB  (6q23),  and  a  locus  linked  to  the  HBB 
cluster, account for a major portion of HbF variation among normal 
individuals  and  patients  with  sickle  cell  anemia  and  β  thalassemia. 
BCL11A,  a  zinc  finger  protein  that  represses  HbF  genes,  binds 
TGACCA motifs, the most important at position –115 in the promoter 
of each γ-globin gene. ZBTB7A binds 85 nucleotides upstream of these 
BCL11A  binding  sites;  its  binding  also  represses  γ-globin  gene  tran-
scription.  When  binding  of  either  BCL11A  or  ZBTB7A  is  disrupted, 
silencing  of  HBG2  and  HBG1  is  abrogated.  The  unique  impact  of 
BCL11A variants on HbF in sickle cell anemia and β thalassemia is due 
their large effect and the high frequency of the variant allele associated 
with increased HbF.

The MYB gene is essential for hematopoiesis and erythroid differ-
entiation. MYB inhibits HbF expression directly by activation of KLF1 
and other repressors and indirectly through alteration of the kinetics of 
erythroid differentiation.

The  third  QTL  is  marked  by  a  common  variant  158  nucleotides 
upstream of the transcription start site of HBG2 and could be a binding 
site for an uncharacterized HbF repressor. Haplotypes associated with 
the HBB cluster have been defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) among these genes. Sickle cell anemia patients with the Senegal 
and  Arab-Indian  HbS  gene-associated  haplotypes  have  higher  HbF 
levels than patients with other haplotypes. These two haplotypes have 
the common–158 C-T variant in the HBG2 promoter.

DIAGNOSIS OF HEMOGLOBIN DISORDERS
α-Globin  gene  mutations  are  expressed  in  the  embryo  and  fetus  and 
persist throughout life; HbF mutations are expressed in the fetus and 
in the first months of life, vanishing from notice afterward; δ-globin 
gene mutations are innocuous and usually not detected; β-globin gene 
mutations  can  become  clinically  apparent  after  the  synthesis  of  HbF 
dwindles to stable adult levels.

With  rare  exceptions,  all  disorders  of  hemoglobin  are  autosomal 
recessive  or  co-dominant  disorders;  a  family  history  of  anemia,  a 
common feature of most symptomatic hemoglobinopathies and thalas-
semias, is often present. In addition to pallor and jaundice, splenomeg-
aly is often present. In sickle cell disease, acute painful vasoocclusive 
episodes are a diagnostic feature. A small number of laboratory tests 
can  confirm  the  diagnosis  starting  with  a  complete  blood  count  that 
includes  a  reticulocyte  count  with  a  careful  review  of  a  peripheral 
blood  film.  A  sustained  increase  in  reticulocyte  count  indicates  the 
presence  of  hemolytic  anemia.  Hemoglobin  fractionation  by  high- 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or capillary electropho-
resis, especially when, in addition to the index case, family members 
are available for study, is often sufficient to confirm a diagnosis at the 
level of hemoglobin phenotype. DNA sequencing of the globin genes 
should allow definitive diagnosis. DNA-based diagnosis, which is read-
ily available from excellent reference laboratories, is a prerequisite for 
most instances of genetic counseling.

Sickle cell disease and β thalassemia have some features in common. 
They are caused by mutations in the β-globin gene; both are chronic 
hemolytic  anemias  sharing  complications  associated  with  hemolysis 
such  as  venous  thrombosis,  leg  ulcers,  and  pulmonary  hypertension; 
and  they  can  be  cured  by  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation. 
Key  differences  are  that  only  HbS  polymerizes  and  that  ineffective

erythropoiesis  is  a  prominent  feature  of  β  thalassemia  and  responsi-
ble  for  its  severe  anemia.  Both  diseases  could  be  cured  by  inducing 
sufficiently high levels of HbF; in sickle cell disease, HbF prevents the 
polymerization of HbS; in β thalassemia, sufficient HbF compensates 
for the deficit of HbA.

SICKLE CELL DISEASE
Sickle cell disease is a clinical and hematologic phenotype caused by 
an assortment of genotypes (Table 98-2). Sickle cell anemia, defined as 
homozygosity for the sickle hemoglobin mutation (α2βS
2; glutamic acid 
[E] 7 valine [V] GAG-GTG), is the most common of these genotypes, 
followed  by  HbSC  disease  or  compound  heterozygosity  for  HbS  and 
HbC (α2βC
2; E 7 lysine [K] GAG-AAG) genes. Many different thalas-
semia mutations contribute to the HbS-β thalassemias. The compound 
heterozygous  genotypes  are  less  common  than  HbS  homozygotes;  as 
a  rule,  their  symptoms  develop  later  in  life  and  are  less  severe.  HbS 
has  also  been  described  with  many  other  variant  hemoglobins.  Few 
of  these  genotypes,  other  than  HbSOArab,  HbSE,  and  HbSDPunjab  are 
symptomatic.
 ■ ORIGIN, SPREAD, AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
HbS originated in Africa between 7000 and 22,000 years ago, reaching 
high frequencies because of the increased genetic fitness of heterozy-
gotes under selective pressure from Plasmodium falciparum. The HbS 
gene became associated with five common β-globin gene haplotypes: 
Benin,  Bantu,  Senegal,  Cameroon,  and  Arab-Indian.  These  haplo-
types  have  a  loose  association  with  the  severity  of  disease  because 
each  haplotype  has  a  different  average  level  of  HbF.  In  some  regions 
of Africa, India, and the Middle East, nearly half the population have 
sickle cell trait. Nigeria alone has ~150,000 newborns each year with 
sickle cell anemia, about one-third of the world’s total newborns; most  
die before age 5. Coerced and free population movement have spread 
the HbS gene throughout the world. The HbS carrier, or sickle cell trait, 

prevalence is 2–15% in emigrant populations; ~100,000 patients in the 
United States have sickle cell disease; their death in childhood is rare, 
with the median age of death in the fifth or sixth decade.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Pathophysiologic  features  of  sickle  cell  disease  are  summarized  in 
Fig.  98-3.  HbS  is  physiologically  similar  to  HbA  in  most  respects 
except  it  polymerizes  when  deoxygenated.  Contacts  between  one  of 
the  β7  valine  residues  of  deoxyHbS  and  specific  amino  acid  residues 
of β- and α-globin culminate in fascicles of hemoglobin that injure the 
sickle erythrocyte. A delay occurs between the initiation of polymer-
ization and the accumulation of sufficient polymer to damage the cell. 
It is unclear how much polymer is needed for cell injury, but it is clear 
that polymer leads directly and indirectly to the multiple abnormalities 
of the sickle erythrocyte that generate the pathophysiology of disease. 
Prominent  among  these  abnormalities  are  HbS  polymer  penetration 
of  the  membrane  causing  vesiculation  with  membrane  microparticle 
release; increased activity of the Gardos, K/CL cotransport, and Psickle 
channels  that  dehydrate  the  cell,  increasing  mean  corpuscular  sickle 
hemoglobin concentration (MC[HbS]C), reducing cellular deformabil-
ity, and increasing the polymerization potential of HbS; translocation 
of amino phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet 
of  the  membrane;  and  oxidation  of  erythrocyte  contents.  These  and 
other abnormalities lead to the formation of irreversibly sickled cells 
(ISCs), which are sickle erythrocytes that are forever deformed because 
of permanent membrane damage regardless of whether HbS remains 
polymerized.  Damaged  sickle  erythrocytes  are  responsible  for  initi-
ating  the  vasoocclusive,  hemolytic,  and  inflammatory  features  of  the 
disease shown in Fig. 98-3.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Although sickle cell disease can appear in any ethnic group, most often 
it is present in people of African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and

FIGURE 98-3  Pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. HbS is in solution when oxygenated but reversibly polymerizes when deoxygenated. Polymerization is dependent 
on the 30th power of hemoglobin concentration. In the sickle cell, this means that small changes in hemoglobin concentration or cell hydration can have large effects on 
polymerization. Polymerization begins seconds to minutes following deoxygenation. Erythrocyte deformation, or sickling, is initially reversible, but after an undetermined 
number of cell sickling events, the cell becomes irreversibly deformed. These are known as irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs). Their membrane is permanently damaged, 
although depending on their oxygen (O2) content, HbS could be in solution. Sickle erythrocytes lead to the clinical and laboratory phenotypes of disease. Sickle cells 
interact with endothelial cells and other blood cells, occluding flow in small and sometimes large vessels and causing the many complications thought to be a result of 
vasoocclusion. Sickle cells also live <20 days (normal ~120 days) hemolyzing intra- and extravascularly. Intravascular hemolysis depletes haptoglobin and hemopexin while 
liberating heme, arginase, and other danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the blood. This scavenges nitric oxide (NO), activates platelets and endothelium, 
reduces antioxidant activity, causes vasoconstriction, and is proinflammatory.

Indian  descent.  The  chief  presenting  symptom  is  pain  that  might  be 
an arthritis-like hand-foot syndrome in young children or the typical 
acute painful episode in older children and adults. In HbSC disease and 
HbS-β+ thalassemia, acute vasoocclusive episodes occur less often and 
complications develop later in life; rarely, patients with these genotypes 
are asymptomatic. The key elements of laboratory diagnosis are out-
lined in Table 98-2 showing typical hematologic findings and hemo-
globin fractions. Figure 98-4 displays HPLC profiles and blood films 
in typical patients with sickle cell trait, sickle cell anemia, and HbSC 
disease. Clinical and basic laboratory diagnosis is sufficient for general 
management and counseling; genetic counseling and family planning 
usually require DNA-based diagnosis.
 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Complications  of  sickle  cell  disease  can  be  grouped  into  those 
that  likely  are  a  consequence  of  sickle  vasoocclusion  and  ones  that 
appeared  to  be  triggered  by  intravascular  hemolysis.  Although 
there  is  a  relationship  between  these  two  limbs  of  pathophysiology, 
complications  associated  with  vasoocclusion  seem  to  respond  best 
to  induction  of  HbF.  Some  complications  of  disease  are  presented 
in  Table  98-3.  Early  and  effective  treatment  with  hydroxyurea  and 
the integration into management of new treatments discussed below 
should change this profile.
Acute  Painful  Episodes  Characterized  by  unprovoked  severe 
pain in extremities or torso that is often symmetrical and stereotypical 

for  each  patient  and  usually  requires  treatment  with  strong  opioids 
in  the  emergency  department,  acute  painful  episodes  are  the  most 
common acute events in sickle cell disease. They are the chief cause of 
concern for patients, most of whom have them at some time in their 
life.  Their  frequency  varies;  most  patients  have  one  to  two  episodes 
a  year;  some  rarely  have  them;  others  are  hardly  ever  without  them. 
Acute painful episodes last days to weeks. Complicating the diagnosis 
and management of the acute pain episode, pain in sickle cell disease 
can be chronic from complications such as osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, 
or leg ulcers; chronic and acute pain can overlap; and pain can also be 
induced  by  opioid  treatment  of  pain.  Diary  studies  have  shown  that 
most of the time patients have some degree of pain that does not reach 
the intensity of the acute episode. Most patients use oral opioid analge-
sics for control of this pain. Reliable patients can be given a reasonable 
supply of oral opioids on a monthly basis.

No  diagnostic  test  can  confirm  or  refute  the  presence  of  an  acute 
pain episode; often a 1 to 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level and a 
modest  increase  in  the  leukocyte  count  are  noted  during  the  painful 
episode. Drastic decreases in hemoglobin and platelet levels with more 
extreme  leukocytosis  can  portend  development  of  severe  acute  chest 
syndrome or multiorgan failure. Acute painful episodes have little to 
do  with  the  presence  of  ISCs  in  the  blood  or  the  reticulocyte  count. 
The most anemic patients seem to have the least pain. It is unusual for 
a cause of acute painful episodes to be identified. Physical examination 
is  not  often  useful  diagnostically.  Some  patients  will  have  pain  on

pressure over an affected area, perhaps accompanied by swelling; mild 
fever is common.

Some  patients  die  suddenly  shortly  after  admission  for  an  acute 
painful episode. The cause of this sudden unexpected death is usually 
unknown;  among  the  possibilities  are  arrhythmias  and  pulmonary 
embolism. Admitting patients to monitored beds or continuous pulse 
oximetry for the first 48–72 h of hospitalization might prevent some 
of  these  deaths  and  help  identify  acute  chest  syndrome  that  follows 
within  72  h  in  about  a  quarter  of  admissions  for  acute  pain.  After 
searching  for  possible  precipitants  such  as  infection  or  dehydration 
and  treating  these  appropriately,  the  foundation  of  treatment  is  the 
proper dosing of opioid analgesics. By the time a patient presents at 
the  emergency  department  or  clinic  requesting  treatment,  they  have 
usually  tried  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and 
oral opioids. In most patients, relief of pain requires the intravenous 
opioids morphine or hydromorphone. Many patients are opioid toler-
ant and require higher than usual doses for satisfactory relief. Dosing 
should not be on an “as-needed” schedule; patient-controlled analgesia 
or a frequent fixed dose of opioids with rescue doses for breakthrough 
pain are the preferred means of treatment, with frequent assessments 
to ensure pain relief without excessive sedation. Adjunctive treatment 
includes  incentive  spirometry  to  forestall  pulmonary  complications, 
maintaining hydration with half-normal saline with care not to ove-
rhydrate, prophylaxis for thromboembolism, and antihistamines and 
laxatives  to  counter  expected  side  effects  of  opioids;  unless  hypoxia 
is  present,  supplemental  O2  is  unnecessary.  Ketorolac  should  not  be 
used, and NSAIDs have little value in patients receiving intravenous 
opioids.

Acute  Chest  Syndrome  This  pneumonia-like  illness  is  the  sec-
ond  most  frequent  acute  sickle  cell–related  event.  It  occurs  in  >50% 
of patients, often more than once. Acute chest syndrome can be mild, 
especially  in  children,  in  whom  it  can  result  from  viral  infection,  or 
devastating, where multiple lobes of the lung are affected with severe 
hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and death. Chest pain, cough, fever, and 
hypoxia and a pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray are the major diag-
nostic  criteria.  The  etiology  includes  in  situ  thrombosis,  emboli,  any 
type  of  infection,  and  postoperative  hypoventilation.  Management 
in  adults  is  dictated  by  the  severity  of  the  episode.  Patients  who  are 
hypoxic  and  febrile  are  often  admitted  directly  to  the  intensive  care 
unit. Antibiotics are almost always used in febrile patients even though 
a causative bacterium is not often cultured. Supplemental O2 is given 
for  an  O2  saturation  <95%.  Overhydration  and  excessive  opioids  can 
compound  dyspnea  and  hypoxia.  Hypoxic  patients  who  are  febrile 
with  leukocytosis  and  have  more  than  a  trivial  infiltrate  on  x-ray  
are transfused. In the more severely ill patient, exchange transfusion is 
the preferred modality. When hemoglobin level or symptoms indicate 
the need for transfusion of the severely ill patient and hours are needed 
to arrange red cell exchange, simple or top-up transfusion should be 
started first. Simple transfusions also suffice for less severely affected 
patients. Most patients survive acute chest syndrome, but in the most 
severe  cases,  often  caused  by  embolization  of  necrotic  bone  marrow, 
death can be rapid even with prompt and proper treatment. Thrombo-
cytopenia, leukocyte counts in excess of 20,000/dL, and rapidly devel-
oping  acute  anemia  often  portend  severe  acute  chest  syndrome  with 
the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan 
failure. Many adults have chronic lung disease that could be a sequela 
of acute chest syndrome, and asthma is very common in patients with 
sickle cell disease.

Osteonecrosis  This  painful  and  sometimes  crippling  complica-
tion that most often affects hips bilaterally occurs in about half of all 
patients with sickle cell anemia and is also common in HbSC disease; 
shoulders are less often affected. Beginning with chronic pain that can 
become severe, loss of function is often the final stage, especially in the 
hips. MRI can detect the earliest stages, whereas x-ray is less sensitive. 
Physical therapy and NSAIDs provide some relief; unfortunately, oral 
opioids  are  sometimes  required.  Joint  replacement  can  restore  lost 
mobility and relieve pain, but the life span of prosthetic joints is finite 

so  surgery  should  be  delayed  as  long  as  mobility  is  satisfactory  and 
pain tolerable.

Leg  Ulcers  The  incidence  of  leg  ulcers  is  highly  dependent  on 
geography  and  hemoglobin  genotype.  They  are  far  less  common  in 
HbSC disease and HbS-β+ thalassemia than in sickle cell anemia and 
HbS-β0  thalassemia.  In  temperate  climates,  10–20%  of  patients  are 
affected;  tropical  and  subtropical  areas  have  an  incidence  rate  up  to 
75%;  ulcers  rarely  occur  in  the  Middle  East.  They  can  be  small  and 
superficial or deep and encompass most of the lower leg. Ulcers can 
be  extraordinarily  painful.  Long-standing,  recurrent  large  ulcers  are 
difficult to treat. Wet-to-dry dressings and Unna boots are reasonable 
choices for initial treatment.

 ■ SICKLE CELL TRAIT (CARRIERS, OR SIMPLE 
HETEROZYGOSITY FOR THE HbS GENE)
Carriers  of  sickle  cell  trait  outnumber  patients  with  the  disease  by 
25 to 1. Counseling and follow-up of carriers detected by cord blood 
screening  are  imperfect.  Adolescents  and  adults  can  forget  that  they 
have sickle cell trait. Although usually a benign condition with a nor-
mal life expectancy, some features of this trait are shown in Table 98-2. 
Counseling sickle cell trait carriers about the small risks of complica-
tions and their likelihood of having offspring with sickle cell disease is 
essential. Counseling prior to participation in sports is also important 
because  of  the  risk,  albeit  a  very  small  one,  of  sudden  death  from 
heat-related exertional rhabdomyolysis. Optimal hydration before and 
during exercise can prevent most episodes of heat-related illness.

 ■ TREATMENT, SCREENING, COUNSELING,  
AND ANTENATAL DIAGNOSIS
Patients should, if possible, be referred to a sickle cell center for ini-
tial  consultation,  follow-up,  and  institution  of  therapy.  Cooperation 
among primary care providers, hematologists, and other specialists can 
provide  the  best  preventive  care  and  management  of  complications. 
The frequency at which a patient is seen depends on their therapeutic 
regimen.

Remarkable changes in the treatment landscape have occurred with 
the  promise  of  even  greater  benefits  from  new  curative  approaches 
based on gene therapy. The following discussion focuses on treatment 
to prevent the complications of disease.

Hydroxyurea  Hydroxyurea is the standard of care for all patients 
with sickle cell anemia and HbS-β0 thalassemia. It is recommended for 
patients of all ages regardless of symptoms and should be started in the 
first year of life. The major mechanism of action of hydroxyurea is to 
induce high levels of HbF. Hydroxyurea increases HbF unevenly in the 
red cell population (heterocellularly), so some cells have greater protec-
tion from HbS polymerization than others. Although often employed in 
symptomatic patients with HbSC disease, its benefits in this genotype 
are understudied. In adults, where the average HbF is ~5%, the increase 
in HbF is often modest. Nevertheless, pain and acute chest syndrome 
are  reduced  by  about  half,  hemoglobin  concentration  increases  by  
~1 g/dL, and after 17.5 years of follow-up, mortality was reduced by 
49%. In contrast, all children respond robustly to hydroxyurea. When 
started at <1 year of age at a dose of ~27 mg/kg, HbF levels were 33.3 ± 
9.1% and hemoglobin concentration was 10.1 ± 1.3 g/dL. Acute events 
were  markedly  reduced  with  little  toxicity.  Based  on  these  and  other 
studies in high- and low-resource countries, unless there is a contrain-
dication, hydroxyurea is standard of care for all patients starting in the 
first  year  of  life  at  a  dose  of  ~20  mg/kg  and  titrated  to  the  maximal 
tolerated dose based on neutrophil and platelet counts.

Voxelotor  Voxelotor increases the affinity of the hemoglobin mole-
cule for O2 (decreases the P50). Voxelotor, 1500 mg daily, was associated 
with a 1-g/dL increase in hemoglobin concentration in 59% of patients 
with a reduction in the biomarkers of hemolysis. Although vasoocclu-
sive events were not significantly reduced in the initial report of effi-
cacy, further analysis after a longer observation period suggested that 
patients achieving the highest hemoglobin had the fewest acute vasooc-
clusive  events.  Voxelotor  increases  hemoglobin-oxygen  affinity  in  all 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   760

21/01/22   3:50 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyerythrocytes  (pancellularly),  and  this  should  provide  an  increment 
in  polymerization  inhibition  beyond  hydroxyurea.  Many  questions 
remain about the long-term effects of voxelotor. Less hemolysis reduces 
the  propensity  for  stroke,  nephropathy,  pulmonary  hypertension,  leg 
ulcers,  and  priapism.  Will  voxelotor  be  accompanied  by  these  long-
term benefits? Could the high O2 affinity of a modified hemoglobin be 
harmful for some patients? The answers to these important questions 
require further study.

Crizanlizumab  Downstream  effects  of  HbS  polymerization 
include  adhesive  interactions  among  endothelial  cells,  leukocytes, 
platelets, and erythrocytes. P-selectin is one molecule involved in these 
interactions; blocking selectins prevents sickle cell–endothelial adhe-
sion. A P-selectin-blocking monoclonal antibody given intravenously 
every month reduced acute painful episodes by ~45%, a reduction sim-
ilar to that seen with hydroxyurea. There were no effects on hemolysis.

l-Glutamine  The mechanism of action of this agent, presumed to 
be the reduction of oxidative stress in sickle erythrocytes, is unsettled. 
In a phase 3 clinical trial, compared with a placebo, l-glutamine was 
associated with a 25% reduction in painful episodes and 33% reduction 
in hospitalization.

There  is  little  consensus  regarding  how  recently  approved  drugs 
should  be  integrated  into  treatment  with  hydroxyurea.  The  effects 
of  voxelotor  and  crizanlizumab  appear  to  be  additive  to  those  of 
hydroxyurea.  Voxelotor  can  be  added  to  hydroxyurea  if  the  benefits 
of  hydroxyurea  alone  are  insufficient,  as  they  are  in  most  adults.  If 
both hydroxyurea and voxelotor are taken at effective doses and acute 
vasoocclusive  complications  continue,  crizanlizumab  could  then  be 
added. The dropout rates in the crizanlizumab and l-glutamine trials 
was ~35% so adherence to these therapeutics could be problematic.

Transfusion  Transfusions  are  overutilized  and  underutilized. 
Major indications for transfusion include severe symptomatic anemia; 
treatment  and  prevention  of  stroke;  increasing  hemoglobin  level  to 
~10 g/dL before surgery requiring general anesthesia; and acute chest 
syndrome  with  hypoxia  or  multiple  lobe  involvement.  Sometimes 
transfusions  are  given  during  pregnancy  when  there  is  a  history  of 
complications or fetal loss. Transfusions should usually be avoided in 
acute pain episodes and for repair of stable chronic anemia. There is a 
preference for automated red cell exchange transfusion in acute stroke, 
severe  acute  chest  syndrome,  or  multiorgan  failure  or  when  chronic 
transfusions  are  planned.  Recent  guidelines  formulated  by  experts 
recommended  extended  red  cell  antigen  profiling,  if  possible  before 
the first transfusion, and antigen matching for Rh (C, E or C/c, E/e) 
and K antigens in addition to ABO/RhD. Complications of transfusion 
include  hyperviscosity,  alloimmunization  (which  occurred  in  18.6% 
of  patients  transfused  between  1979  and  1984  and  27.3%  of  patients 
transfused between 2001 and 2011), iron overload, delayed hemolytic 
transfusion reactions, and hyperhemolysis.

Stem Cell Transplantation  Given the excellent results of human 
leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)–identical  related  donor  transplants,  which 
have an event-free survival of >95%, this option might be extended to 
all patients with a suitable donor. Unfortunately, only 15% of patients 
have a fully matched donor. New approaches to haploidentical trans-
plants are improving event-free survival in these patients.

Preventive Measures and Screening  Cord blood screening for 
sickle cell disease is done in many countries and all 50 states. Affected 
patients  are  then  directed  to  clinics  that  can  initiate  early  preventive 
care.  In  childhood,  transcranial  Doppler  screening  beginning  at  age  
2 years and repeated annually until age 16 years, prophylactic penicillin 
(125 mg for children younger than 3 years; 250 mg for children 3 years 
and older) twice daily until age 5 years, and vaccination with pneumo-
coccal vaccines are the main measures to prevent stroke and invasive 
pneumococcal  infection.  Folic  acid,  1  mg  daily,  is  given  to  prevent 
megaloblastic erythropoiesis; it is probably unnecessary in people with 
nutritious diets.

All women planning pregnancy should be screened for disorders of 
hemoglobin by blood counts, erythrocyte indices, and HPLC analysis 

of  hemoglobin.  Individuals  with  HbS  or  β  thalassemia  trait  should 
have their partners tested. Only then is it possible to know the risks of 
a fetus having sickle cell disease (Table 98-2). Antenatal diagnosis using 
chorionic villus sampling is widely available.

761

Emerging  Treatments  Gene  therapy  has  curative  potential  and 
requires neither matched donors nor immunosuppression. Autologous 
hematopoietic CD34+ stem cells are mobilized and modified ex vivo 
to produce an antisickling globin. These cells are reinfused following 
myeloablative conditioning. Phase 1/2 clinical trials have used lentivi-
rus transduction of CD34+ cells with an antisickling β-globin or have 
interfered with the HbF-suppressive effects of BCL11A using CRISPR/
Cas, zinc finger nucleases, or shRNA. These approaches have resulted 
in  HbF  or  antisickling  hemoglobin  levels  of  nearly  50%,  reduced 
hemolysis, total hemoglobin levels of >11 g/dL, and resolution of acute 
vasoocclusive events. It is too early to know their long-term safety or 
cure rate.

THALASSEMIA
Thalassemia is caused by reduced accumulation of either α- or β-globin 
chains  causing  a  relative  excess  of  the  unaffected  chain.  Unbalanced 
globin synthesis is the hallmark of thalassemia and the proximate cause 
of its pathophysiology; unpaired globin chains damage the developing 
erythroblast.  Like  the  HbS  mutation  and  many  other  red  cell  traits, 
thalassemia  reached  polymorphic  levels  in  tropical  and  subtropical 
populations  because  heterozygotes  are  protected  from  Plasmodium 
falciparum infection. Estimates are that 1–5% of the world’s population 
carries  a  thalassemia  mutation;  in  some  locales,  most  people  have  a 
thalassemia mutation. These mutations can affect any globin gene, but 
clinically, β and α thalassemia are the most important. With nearly 500 
unique  thalassemia-causing  mutations  (www.globin.bx.psu.edu)  that 
can interact with each other and with hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia 
syndromes  are  remarkably  diverse.  Where  resources  permit  and  the 
mutation is known, genetic counseling can be provided and antenatal 
diagnosis is possible.

HbE (β27 glu-lys) is a common variant whose biosynthesis is reduced 
because the site of the mutation alters its mRNA processing. Its reduced 
biosynthesis leads to a deficit of βE-globin chains and features of β tha-
lassemia. Hemoglobin Constant Spring is caused by a mutation of the 
termination codon of HBA2 that leads to the synthesis of an elongated 
α-globin  chain  that  is  unstable  and  suboptimally  synthesized.  This 
variant therefore behaves as an α thalassemia variant.

a THALASSEMIA
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Once known as Mediterranean anemia, because of the concentration of 
cases in Italy, Greece, and other countries bordering the Mediterranean 
Sea, or as Cooley’s anemia after the physician first describing cases, β 
thalassemia is common in most areas of the world where malaria was 
endemic.  Effective  programs  of  screening,  counseling,  and  antenatal 
diagnosis have reduced the birth of new cases from the Mediterranean 
region. The bulk of new patients now are of Asian, Middle Eastern, and 
Indian origin. About 40,000 β thalassemia patients are born yearly. In 
the United States there are ~1000 cases of severe β thalassemia.

 ■ CLASSIFICATION
β0 Thalassemia mutations totally prevent the accumulation of any glo-
bin from the affected gene; β+ thalassemia mutations cause minor or 
extreme reductions in β-globin synthesis. β Thalassemia major and β 
thalassemia intermedia are now categorized as transfusion-dependent 
and non-transfusion-dependent based on the number and frequency 
of transfusions required to sustain a good quality of life.

Pathophysiology  Single nucleotide changes are the most common 
β thalassemia mutations, but gene deletions also occur. A partial listing 
of the classes of mutations causing β thalassemia include mutations in 
the promoter elements affecting gene transcription causing mild and 
sometimes  silent  β+  thalassemia;  mutations  in  the  junctions  between

exons and introns that affect mRNA processing causing β0 and β+ tha-
lassemia; introduction of alternative splice sites into introns or exons 
usually causing β+ thalassemia; 3′ end-processing sequence mutations 
preventing  RNA  polyadenylation  leading  to  mild  or  silent  β+  thalas-
semia;  mutations  preventing  initiation  of  translation  causing  β0  tha-
lassemia; and introduction of stop codons that prematurely terminate 
translation  (nonsense  mutations)  producing  reading  frameshifts  and 
resulting in truncated globin mRNA and β0 thalassemia.

In  β  thalassemia,  the  deficit  in  β-globin  chain  synthesis  allows 
α-globin chains to accumulate in excess. Without a non-α-globin chain 
partner in dimer and tetramer formation, unpaired α-globin chains are 
unstable, cannot form a tetramer, and precipitate within the developing 
erythroblast, causing membrane lipid oxidation and damage. The pre-
dominant cause of anemia is intramedullary destruction of erythroid 
precursors, known as ineffective erythropoiesis. Reduced deformability 
and phosphatidyl serine exposure also cause extra- and intravascular 
hemolysis of those erythrocytes that gain entrance into the circulation. 
In poorly treated β thalassemia, severe anemia leads to bone marrow 
expansion; hepatosplenomegaly; iron accumulation in liver, heart, and 
endocrine  organs;  pulmonary  hypertension;  and  thromboembolic 
disease.

Frightening pictures of children with severe β thalassemia permeate 
the literature. These examples of near-terminal disease should be rel-
egated to history because treatment with transfusion and iron chelation 
can prevent their occurrence and hematopoietic stem cell transplanta-
tion can “cure” patients who have suitable donors.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Heterozygous β thalassemia, also known as β thalassemia trait and β 
thalassemia minor, has mild or no anemia but microcytic/hypochromic  
erythrocytes with minimal or no increase in reticulocyte count. After 
recognizing these hematologic abnormalities and excluding iron defi-
ciency, finding an elevated level of HbA2 and perhaps HbF by HPLC 
is sufficient to establish this diagnosis. The hematologic characteristics 
of this heterozygous carrier state are listed in Table 98-4. Sometimes, the 
spleen  is  enlarged.  Before  genetic  counseling  and  antenatal  diagno-
sis  are  considered  after  carrier  identification  by  red  cell  indices  and 
quantitation  of  HbA2,  the  thalassemia-causing  mutation  should  be 
identified.  This  is  the  key  to  preventing  homozygotes  or  compound 
heterozygotes with transfusion-dependent thalassemia.

The more severe forms of β thalassemia are hemolytic anemias with 
hypochromia, microcytosis, reticulocytosis, marked anisocytosis, and

blood film. A lymphocyte is shown for size comparison.

poikilocytosis with variable numbers of circulating nucleated red cells 
(Fig. 98-5).

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Complications of severe β thalassemia are many. They are a consequence 
of  chronic  hemolytic  anemia,  chronic  transfusion,  and  iron  loading. 
Increased  iron  absorption  is  especially  common  in  non-transfusion- 
dependent thalassemia. Most complications, listed in Table 98-5, develop 
because of either inadequate blood transfusion and/or poor iron chela-
tion and iron loading. Even when chelation is optimized, some complica-
tions attributable to iron toxicity will develop. Many complications have 
complex and multifactorial etiologies. Iron stores are estimated by serum 
ferritin levels; MRI is the most widespread means of noninvasively mea-
suring iron accumulation in liver and heart.

 ■ MANAGEMENT, SCREENING, COUNSELING,  
AND ANTENATAL DIAGNOSIS
Heterozygote  screening  and  counseling  couples  at  risk  for  affected 
fetuses, with antenatal diagnosis, if needed, is an effective preventive 
approach.  Severe  thalassemia  should  be  dealt  with  in  specialized

CLINICAL FEATURES
Heterozygosity for β+ or β0 thalassemia mutations; “silent” carriers can have normal HbA2 and 
red cell indices.

Defined by infrequent or no transfusion requirement; caused by many different genotypes 
including homozygosity for “mild” β+ mutations, combinations of β and α thalassemia, 
homozygous β thalassemia with high HbF producing capacity, and many others. Iron loading, 
thromboembolic disease, and pulmonary hypertension are major clinical events.
Caused by many different genotypes including homozygosity and compound heterozygosity 
for β0 and β+ mutations, combinations of β and α thalassemia; transplantation curative; iron 
chelation required.

Common in SE Asian populations; in some parts of the word, the most prevalent severe 
thalassemia; in HbE-β0 thalassemia, only HbE and HbF are found; in HbE-β+ thalassemia, HbA 
is present. Transfusion dependence depends in part on the thalassemia mutation.
Rare; deletions removing the δ- and β-globin genes cause δβ thalassemia; Lepore 
hemoglobins are fusion globin chains; values are for heterozygotes; homozygotes have 100% 
HbF with hemoglobin 10–11 g/dL.

Rare; large deletions removing the δ- and β-globin genes; values are for heterozygotes; 
homozygotes, who are asymptomatic, have 100% HbF without anemia.

centers where these and other services are available and managed by 
a team led by a hematologist experienced with this disease with help 
from endocrinologists, cardiologists, transfusion medicine specialists, 
and social services.

Transfusion  and  Iron  Chelation  Transfusion  every  2–4  weeks 
with a goal pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration of 9–10.5 g/dL, 
coupled with oral iron chelation to prevent the accumulation of excess 
toxic  iron  that  accompanies  transfusion,  has  prevented  the  develop-
ment of cardiomyopathy and endocrinopathies while extending life to 
at least 50 years. When to begin transfusions, whether partial exchange 
transfusion is preferable to simple transfusion, and the choice of blood 
product  require  consultation  with  experts.  To  be  effective,  transfu-
sions and iron chelation must be started early, be uninterrupted, and 
continue  lifelong.  Older  patients  who  did  not  have  the  advantage  of 
effective chelation are more likely to develop multiple disease-related 
morbidities such as osteoporosis, endocrinopathies, liver disease, and 
renal  failure.  Two  orally  effective  chelating  agents,  deferasirox  and 
deferiprone, and one intravenous chelator, deferoxamine, are available.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  There is consensus 
that  patients  with  available  donors  should  be  offered  transplantation 
because  of  the  difficulty  of  lifelong  transfusion  and  chelation  and  its 
imperfect efficacy. Quality of life in successfully transplanted patients 
exceeds that in patients treated with transfusion and chelation. Trans-
plantation  from  matched  sibling  donors  is  curative  in  >80%  of  all 
cases.  Unfortunately,  only  a  third  of  patients  have  matched  donors. 
The best results are in the youngest patients who have been effectively 
chelated and received fewer transfusions. Graft failure, graft rejection, 

graft-versus-host disease, and a mortality of 5–20% depending on risk 
factors  are  the  major  drawbacks  of  this  procedure.  Results  of  hap-
loidentical and unrelated donor transplants are improving but lag those 
of matched sibling donors.

Improving  Ineffective  Erythropoiesis  Luspatercept,  a  fusion 
protein containing the extracellular domain of human activin type IIB 
receptor and the Fc domain of human IgG, was recently approved for 
treatment  of  transfusion-dependent  thalassemia.  By  binding  trans-
forming  growth  factor  β  superfamily  ligands  and  reducing  Smad2/3 
signaling, luspatercept enhances late-stage erythropoiesis. Given sub-
cutaneously,  1  mg/kg  every  3  weeks,  it  was  associated  with  a  33% 
reduction in transfusion requirements.

Gene Therapy  Lentiviral mediated gene therapy using autologous 
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells has been approved in Europe for some 
patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia who lack a matched 
donor. In a clinical trial with a median follow-up of 26 months, where 
patients received autologous CD34+ cells transduced with a lentiviral 
vector containing a modified HbA, transfusions were reduced or elim-
inated  and  hemoglobin  levels  stabilized  between  8.2  and  13.7  g/dL. 
However, the results were dependent on the β thalassemia mutation, 
and  although  transfusion  independence  was  achieved,  some  features 
of disease such as ineffective erythropoiesis were not eliminated. The 
initial  results  of  CRISPR/Cas  editing  to  downregulate  BCL11A  in  β 
thalassemia have eliminated the need for transfusion and normalized 
hemoglobin levels (see Sickle Cell Disease).

` THALASSEMIA
In some respects the obverse of β thalassemia, clinically consequential 
α thalassemia is less common than severe β thalassemia. α Thalassemia 
is most often found in Asian populations and is usually caused by dele-
tion of α-globin genes rather than point mutations.

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
Carriers of the most common α thalassemia chromosomes (Table 98-6) 
are found in 5–80% of people from tropical and subtropical regions of 
Africa, the Middle East, India, Southern China, and Melanesia. About 
30% of African Americans carry the common –α3.7 chromosome that 
contains a single functional α-globin gene. HbH disease, the chief clin-
ically  important  α  thalassemia,  is  most  prevalent  in  Southern  China 
and Southeast Asia. Estimates are that in Thailand ~3500 patients with 
severe  α  thalassemia  are  born  yearly.  Pregnancies  affected  by  hemo-
globin (Hb) Bart’s hydrops fetalis occur mainly in Southern China and 
Southeastern Asia.

 ■ CLASSIFICATION
Each  normal  chromosome  16  contains  two  α-globin  genes;  normal 
diploid  individuals  have  four  α-globin  genes.  A  classification  of 
inherited α thalassemia, as summarized in Table 98-6, is based on the 
number of functional α-globin genes. If one or two α-globin genes are 
missing  or  poorly  expressed,  these  people  have  α  thalassemia  trait. 
Their hematologic abnormalities are almost always trivial. HbH disease 
is usually caused by deletion or malfunction of three α-globin genes. 
Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis fetuses have no normally functioning α-globin 
genes. Hundreds of different sized deletions and rarer point mutations 
affect  the  production  of  α  globin  and  the  magnitude  of  imbalanced 
globin synthesis. Because of this mutational complexity, many different 
variations of the common α thalassemia syndromes are found.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Reduced  accumulation  of  α-globin  leaves  non-α-globins  unpaired 
and  unable  to  participate  in  the  formation  of  functional  hemoglobin 
tetramers. In the fetus, absent or reduced synthesis of α-globin allows 
unpaired γ-globin chains, which are usually part of the HbF tetramer, 
to form γ4 or Hb Bart’s; in adults, when γ-globin synthesis is mostly 
silenced, unpaired β-globin chains, lacking a suitable partner to form 
HbA,  tetramerize  as  β4  or  HbH.  Both  Hb  Bart’s  and  HbH  have  very 
high O2 affinity and do not unload O2 in tissues; HbH is also unstable. 
Severe anemia in Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis is a result of absent normal

(α thalassemia-1); non–gene deletion α thalassemias (αT) often have a more severe 
phenotype.

Mild to moderate anemia depending on genotype; non–gene deletion forms of α 
thalassemia can produce severe HbH disease.

Fatal in utero or at birth with rare survivors. Hydrops can also result from combinations 
of gene deletion and non–gene deletion α thalassemia.

chromosome with both α-globin genes deleted; αT represents non–gene deletion α thalassemia caused by point mutations. The −α/ chromosome, referred to as α+ or α 
thalassemia-2, most often has a deletion of 3.7 kb of DNA (–α3.7) or 4.2 kb of DNA (–α4.2) that leaves but a single α-globin gene intact. The chromosome where both α-globin 
genes are deleted (– --/) is called α0 thalassemia or α thalassemia-1. These chromosomes are caused by different-sized deletions that are usually named after their regions 
of highest frequency such as -SEA, -MED, -FI, and -THAI.

hemoglobin  and  ineffective  erythropoiesis;  in  HbH  disease,  unstable 
HbH leads to oxidative membrane damage with extravascular hemoly-
sis in the spleen and ineffective erythropoiesis.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Microcytosis/hypochromia  with  nearly  normal  hemoglobin  concen-
trations,  in  the  absence  of  iron  deficiency  and  the  increased  level  of 
HbA2 that is diagnostic of β thalassemia, is sufficient for a presumptive 
diagnosis  of  α  thalassemia  trait.  When  genetic  counseling  is  needed 
and antenatal diagnosis contemplated, the molecular basis of the pre-
sumed  α  thalassemia  is  required.  HbH  disease,  which  is  usually  due 
to compound heterozygosity for one chromosome with both α-globin 
genes deleted and one chromosome with only a single α-globin gene, 
is defined by the hematologic findings shown in Table 98-6 along with 
varying  levels  of  reticulocytosis.  At  birth,  when  hemoglobin  is  sepa-
rated by HPLC, 20–30% Hb Bart’s is present; in adults, traces to 40% 
HbH  are  present  along  with  residual  Hb  Bart’s  in  some  cases.  HbH 
inclusions can be induced in some red cells after incubation and stain-
ing  with  brilliant  cresyl  blue.  Hemoglobin  composition  in  Hb  Bart’s 
hydrops fetalis is predominantly Hb Bart’s with some Hb Portland if 
the deletion removing α-globin genes preserves the ζ-globin gene.

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
HbH  disease  is  very  heterogeneous  because  of  the  different  combi-
nations  of  genotypes  that  can  cause  this  phenotype.  Generally,  when 
non–gene deletion mutants, such as Hb Constant Spring, contribute to 
the genotype, the disease is more severe. In the most common − −/−α 
genotype, mean hemoglobin in adults is ~11 g/dL Hepatosplenomeg-
aly, jaundice, thalassemic bone changes in the face, and growth impair-
ment are seen 20–50% of cases, depending on the underlying genotype. 
Iron loading occurs but is not the severe problem it is in β thalassemia. 
Pregnancy in these patients should be considered high risk and man-
aged accordingly. Mothers of infants with Hb Bart’s hydrops fetalis have 
a history of stillbirth and develop preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, and 
antepartum  hemorrhage  and  have  difficult  labor  and  delivery.  Intra-
uterine transfusion of the fetus is possible.

 ■ MANAGEMENT, SCREENING, COUNSELING,  
AND ANTENATAL DIAGNOSIS
When  planning  families,  couples  from  regions  where  α  thalassemia 
is  common  who  have  red  cell  indices  that  suggest  the  possibility  of 
carrying an α thalassemia gene should have genetic counseling based 

on DNA analysis of their globin genes. Iron should be avoided in non- 
iron-deficient  individuals  with  α  thalassemia  trait  and  microcytosis. 
Transfusions  are  not  usually  needed  in  HbH  disease.  Nevertheless, 
depending on the genotype of disease, transfusions might be necessary 
especially when anemia becomes more severe, for example, with acute 
anemic episodes or pregnancy. Iron stores should be checked period-
ically by measuring serum ferritin or MRI; chelation does not appear 
to be needed.

Hb  Bart’s  hydrops  fetalis  is  best  prevented  by  screening  couples 
at  risk  and  antenatal  diagnosis.  Intrauterine  therapy  and  perinatal 
intensive care have permitted survival of some infants with Hb Bart’s 
hydrops  fetalis.  As  growth  retardation  affects  ~40%  and  neurodevel-
opmental delay is present in 20% of survivors, prevention is the best 
approach.

OTHER HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES OF 
CLINICAL IMPORTANCE (TABLE 98-7)
Thirteen-hundred mutations affecting hemoglobin structure have been 
described (www.globin.bx.psu.edu). Most are clinically silent. HbC and 
HbE are common. HbC is found in people of African descent and HbE 
in South China and Southeast Asia. Heterozygotes for HbC and HbE 
are clinically well. Even individuals homozygous for these mutations, 
where the variant hemoglobin comprises >90% of the hemolysate, are 
clinically  well  with  very  mild  anemia  and  microcytosis.  The  major 
importance of these variants is the interaction of HbC with HbS and 
HbE with β thalassemia, as outlined in Tables 98-2 and 98-4. A definitive 
diagnosis for all rare variants depends on DNA analysis.

Unexpected low O2 saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) with nor-
mal O2 saturation of arterial blood is occasionally seen in rare hemo-
globin variants with clinical phenotypes. Asymptomatic patients with 
unexpectedly low SpO2 should not be subjected to unneeded cardio-
pulmonary investigations in search of the cause of their “hypoxemia” 
until the existence of a hemoglobin variant is excluded.

 ■ M HEMOGLOBINS
M  (met)  hemoglobins  are  characterized  by  oxidation  of  the  heme-
iron  from  its  ferrous  (Fe++)  to  ferric  (Fe+++)  form.  The  major  clinical 
feature  of  these  disorders  is  cyanosis  that  is  asymptomatic.  Nine  M 
hemoglobin  variants  have  been  described.  In  seven,  the  mutation 
involves  histidine  residues  that  interact  with  heme.  Asymptomatic 
slate gray/brownish pseudocyanosis is the main clinical finding. Spec-
trophotometric recording of the visible spectrum of the hemolysate is

due to drugs or cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R3) deficiency, potas-
sium cyanide (KCN) can be added to the hemolysate; methemoglobin- 
containing blood will turn red, but KCN has no effect on M hemoglobin. 
Treatment is not needed.
 ■ UNSTABLE HEMOGLOBINS
Sometimes  referred  to  as  congenital  Heinz  body  hemolytic  anemias, 
some mutations result in a hemoglobin tetramer that is unstable and 
precipitates  intracellularly.  Such  variants  are  rare  and  often  a  result 
of a new mutation that affects the tertiary or quaternary structure of  
the molecule. The most common class of mutations introduce a pro-
line residue in the α helix or a polar amino acid into the interion of 
the molecule. Heinz bodies are intraerythrocytic precipitates that are 
detectable as dark globular aggregates after staining with a dye such as 
brilliant cresyl blue. Three unstable hemoglobins are the most common 
of these rare variants. Hemoglobin Köln (β99 val-met) has been found 
in multiple families, Hb Hasharon (α47 asp-his) is found in Ashkenazi 
Jews,  and  Hb  Zurich  (β63  his-arg)  is  susceptible  to  oxidant  drug- 
induced  hemolysis.  Unstable  variants  present  with  nonspherocytic 
hemolytic anemia, but presentation is highly variable. The associated 
disease is usually mild and does not require transfusion. Heating blood 
to  50°C  or  incubation  with  isopropanol  precipitates  unstable  hemo-
globins but must be done with careful controls. Some variants can be 
detected by HPLC.
 ■ HEMOGLOBINS WITH HIGH OXYGEN AFFINITY 
AND LOW OXYGEN AFFINITY
Rare mutations in areas involved in the R-T transition, at critical inter-
faces  between  globin  chains  of  the  tetramer  that  reduce  the  affinity 
for  2,3-bisphosphoglycerate,  or  present  in  the  heme  pocket  account 
for  most  of  these  variants.  High  O2  affinity  hemoglobins  outnum-
ber  low  O2  affinity  variants  by  two  to  one.  Isolated  erythrocytosis 
in  the  absence  of  splenomegaly  suggests  the  presence  of  a  high  O2 
affinity  hemoglobin.  High  O2  affinity  hemoglobin  variants  shift  the  
hemoglobin-O2  dissociation  curve  leftward,  causing  a  low  P50  and 
thereby stimulating erythropoiesis. Many of these variants are due to 
new mutations. The clinical course is benign, and phlebotomy because 
of erythrocytosis is usually not required. Early diagnosis is important 
to  forestall  unnecessary  diagnostic  procedures  and  therapeutics  such 
as cardiac catheterization to exclude congenital heart disease or treat-
ment for polycythemia vera. Low O2 affinity variants often present with 
cyanosis. Their hemoglobin-O2 dissociation curve is right-shifted with 

high  P50.  HPLC  might  reveal  the  presence  of  a  hemoglobin  variant. 
Treatment is often not necessary.

 ■ ACQUIRED DISORDERS OF HEMOGLOBIN
CO binds hemoglobin with high affinity forming carboxyhemoglobin. 
Carboxyhemoglobin levels can be accurately measured by co-oximetry 
of arterial blood. Standard pulse oximeters cannot accurately make this 
measurement. Some newly developed pulse oximeters are able to mea-
sure both carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. Bound CO inhibits 
the  transport  of  O2;  the  hemoglobin-O2  binding  curve  is  left-shifted. 
Acute and chronic CO intoxication, caused by occupational exposure 
and other sources of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, presents 
with  headache,  altered  mental  status,  and  other  constitutional  symp-
toms.  High-flow  O2  via  facemask  is  the  preferred  treatment;  criteria 
have been developed to guide the use of hyperbaric O2.

Acquired  methemoglobinemia  and  methemoglobinemia  due  to 
deficiency  of  CYB5R3  are  more  common  than  the  M  hemoglobins. 
CYB5R3  is  required  for  the  reduction  of  methemoglobin  by  NADH. 
Affected  individuals  with  “toxic”  methemoglobinemia  can  be  cyan-
otic and symptomatic. As in carboxyhemoglobinemia, O2 transport is 
reduced and reflected by the left-shift in the hemoglobin-O2 binding 
curve.  CYB5R3  deficiency  usually  affects  only  erythrocytes  (type  I), 
causing a mild disorder; when all cells are affected (type II), a severe 
disease results. Intravenous methylene blue is the preferred treatment in 
symptomatic patients with acquired methemoglobinemia and 40–60% 
methemoglobin.  The  usual  dose  is  1–2  mg/kg.  Alternative  treatment 
with ascorbic acid is preferable in people who are glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficient. Methylene blue interferes with co-oximetry, 
reducing the value of co-oximetry for monitoring treatment.

Many  drugs  and  chemicals  can  induce  methemoglobin  in  the 
absence of CYB5R3 deficiency. Dapsone and topical anesthetics such 
as benzocaine are the most common offending agents.

99 Megaloblastic Anemias

A. Victor Hoffbrand

The megaloblastic anemias are a group of disorders characterized by 
the presence of distinctive morphologic appearances of the developing 
red cells in the bone marrow. The marrow is usually hypercellular, and 
the anemia is based on ineffective erythropoiesis. The cause is usually a 
deficiency of either cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate, but megaloblastic 
anemia  may  occur  because  of  genetic  or  acquired  abnormalities  that 
affect the metabolism of these vitamins or because of defects in DNA 
synthesis not related to cobalamin or folate (Table 99-1).

COBALAMIN
Cobalamin (vitamin B12) exists in a number of different chemical forms. 
All  have  a  cobalt  atom  at  the  center  of  a  corrin  ring.  In  nature,  the 
vitamin is mainly in the 2-deoxyadenosyl (ado) form, which is located 
in  mitochondria.  It  is  the  cofactor  for  the  enzyme  L-methylmalonyl 
coenzyme  A  (CoA)  mutase.  The  other  major  natural  cobalamin  is 
methylcobalamin, the form in human plasma and in cell cytoplasm. It 
is  the  cofactor  for  methionine  synthase.  Minor  amounts  of  hydroxo-
cobalamin  are  also  present  to  which  methyl-  and  adocobalamin  are 
converted rapidly by exposure to light.
 ■ DIETARY SOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS
Cobalamin is synthesized solely by microorganisms. Ruminants obtain 
cobalamin from the foregut, but the only source for humans is food of 
animal origin, for example, meat, fish, and dairy products. Vegetables, 
fruits,  and  other  foods  of  nonanimal  origin  are  free  from  cobalamin 
unless they are contaminated by bacteria. A normal Western diet con-
tains 5–30 μg of cobalamin daily. Adult daily losses (mainly in the urine 
and  feces)  are  1–3  μg  (∼0.1%  of  body  stores),  and  because  the  body

does not have the ability to degrade cobalamin, daily requirements are 
also about 1–3 μg. Body stores are of the order of 2–3 mg, sufficient for 
3–4 years if supplies are completely cut off.

 ■ ABSORPTION
Two mechanisms exist for cobalamin absorption. One is passive, occur-
ring equally through buccal, duodenal, and ileal mucosa; it is rapid but 
extremely  inefficient,  with  <1%  of  an  oral  dose  being  absorbed  by 
this  process.  The  normal  physiologic  mechanism  is  active;  it  occurs 
through  the  ileum  and  is  efficient  for  small  (a  few  micrograms)  oral 
doses of cobalamin, and it is mediated by gastric intrinsic factor (IF). 
Dietary  cobalamin  is  released  from  protein  complexes  by  enzymes 
in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum; it combines rapidly with a 
salivary glycoprotein that belongs to the family of cobalamin-binding 
proteins  known  as  haptocorrins  (HCs).  In  the  intestine,  the  HC  is 
digested by pancreatic trypsin and the cobalamin is transferred to IF.

IF (gene at chromosome 11q13) is produced in the gastric parietal 
cells of the fundus and body of the stomach, and its secretion parallels 
that  of  hydrochloric  acid.  Normally,  a  vast  excess  of  IF  is  available. 
The  IF-cobalamin  complex  passes  to  the  ileum,  where  IF  attaches 
to  a  specific  receptor  (cubilin)  on  the  microvillus  membrane  of  the 
enterocytes.  Cubilin  also  is  present  in  yolk  sac  and  renal  proximal 
tubular epithelium. Cubilin appears to traffic by means of amnionless 
(AMN),  an  endocytic  receptor  protein  that  directs  sublocalization 
and endocytosis of cubilin with its ligand IF-cobalamin complex. The 
cobalamin-IF complex enters the ileal cell, where IF is destroyed. After 
a delay of about 6 h, the cobalamin appears in portal blood attached to 
transcobalamin (TC) II.

Between  0.5  and  5  μg  of  cobalamin  enter  the  bile  each  day.  This 
binds to IF, and a major portion of biliary cobalamin normally is reab-
sorbed together with cobalamin derived from sloughed intestinal cells. 
Because  of  the  appreciable  amount  of  cobalamin  undergoing  entero-
hepatic  circulation,  cobalamin  deficiency  develops  more  rapidly  in 
individuals who malabsorb cobalamin than it does in vegans, in whom 
reabsorption of biliary cobalamin is intact.

 ■ TRANSPORT
Two main cobalamin transport proteins exist in human plasma; they 
both bind cobalamin—one molecule for one molecule. One HC, also 
known as TC I, is closely related to other cobalamin-binding HCs in 
milk, gastric juice, bile, saliva, and other fluids. The gene TCNL is at 
chromosome 11q11-q12.3. These HCs differ from each other only in 
the  carbohydrate  moiety  of  the  molecule.  TC  I  is  derived  primarily 
from  the  specific  granules  in  neutrophils.  Normally,  it  is  about  two-
thirds saturated with cobalamin, which it binds tightly. TC I does not 
enhance cobalamin entry into tissues. Glycoprotein receptors on liver 
cells are involved in the removal of TC I from plasma, and TC I may 
play  a  role  in  the  transport  of  cobalamin  analogues  (which  it  binds 
more effectively than IF) to the liver for excretion in bile.

The other major cobalamin transport protein in plasma is transcobal-
amin, also known as TC II. The gene is on chromosome 22q11-q13.1. 
As for IF and HC, there are nine exons. The three proteins are likely to 
have  a  common  ancestral  origin.  TC  II  is  synthesized  by  liver  and  by 
other tissues, including macrophages, ileum, and vascular endothelium. 
It normally carries only 20–60 ng of cobalamin per liter of plasma and 
readily gives up cobalamin to marrow, placenta, and other tissues, which 
it enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the TC II receptor 
and megalin (encoded by the LRP-2 gene). The TC II cobalamin is inter-
nalized by endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits; the complex is degraded, 
but the receptor probably is recycled to the cell membrane as is the case 
for transferrin. Export of “free” cobalamin is via the ATP-binding cas-
sette drug transporter alias multidrug resistance protein 1.

FOLATE
 ■ DIETARY FOLATE
Folic (pteroylglutamic) acid is a yellow, crystalline, water-soluble sub-
stance.  It  is  the  parent  compound  of  a  large  family  of  natural  folate 
compounds, which differ from it in three respects: (1) they are partly or

completely reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) or tetrahydrofolate (THF) 
derivatives, (2) they usually contain a single carbon unit (Table 99-2), 
and (3) 70–90% of natural folates are folate-polyglutamates.

Most  foods  contain  some  folate.  The  highest  concentrations  are 
found in liver, yeast, spinach, other greens, and nuts (>100 μg/100 g). 
The total folate content of an average Western diet is ∼250 μg daily, but 
the amount varies widely according to the type of food eaten and the 
method of cooking. Folate is easily destroyed by heating, particularly 
in  large  volumes  of  water.  Total-body  folate  in  the  adult  is  ∼10  mg, 
with the liver containing the largest store. Daily adult requirements are  
∼100  μg,  and  so  stores  are  sufficient  for  only  3–4  months  in  normal 
adults, and severe folate deficiency may develop rapidly.
 ■ ABSORPTION
Folates  are  absorbed  rapidly  from  the  upper  small  intestine.  The 
absorption of folate polyglutamates is less efficient than that of monog-
lutamates; on average, ∼50% of food folate is absorbed. Polyglutamate 
forms  are  hydrolyzed  to  the  monoglutamate  derivatives  either  in  the 
lumen of the intestine or within the mucosa. All dietary folates are con-
verted to 5-methyl-THF (5-MTHF) within the small intestinal mucosa 
before entering portal plasma. The monoglutamates are actively trans-
ported  across  the  enterocyte  by  a  proton-coupled  folate  transporter 
(PCFT,  SCL46A1).  This  is  situated  at  the  apical  brush  border  and  is 
most  active  at  pH  5.5,  which  is  about  the  pH  of  the  duodenal  and 
jejunal surface. Genetic mutations of this protein underlie hereditary 
malabsorption of folate (see below). Pteroylglutamic acid at doses >400 
μg is absorbed largely unchanged and converted to natural folates in 
the  liver.  Lower  doses  are  converted  to  5-MTHF  during  absorption 
through the intestine.

About  60–90  μg  of  folate  enter  the  bile  each  day  and  are  excreted 
into the small intestine. Loss of this folate, together with the folate of 
sloughed intestinal cells, accelerates the speed with which folate defi-
ciency develops in malabsorption conditions.
 ■ TRANSPORT
Folate  is  transported  in  plasma;  about  one-third  is  loosely  bound  to 
albumin,  and  two-thirds  are  unbound.  In  all  body  fluids  (plasma, 
cerebrospinal fluid, milk, bile), folate is largely, if not entirely, 5-MTHF 
in  the  monoglutamate  form.  Three  types  of  folate-binding  protein 
are  involved.  A  reduced  folate  transporter  (RFC,  SLC19A1)  is  the 
major route of delivery of plasma folate (5-MTHF) to cells. Two folate 
receptors, FR2 and FR3 embedded in the cell membrane by a glycosyl 
phosphatidylinositol anchor, transport folate into the cell via receptor- 
mediated  endocytosis.  The  third  protein,  proton-coupled  folate 

transporter (PCFT), transports folate at low pH from the vesicle to the 
cell cytoplasm. The reduced folate transporter also mediates uptake of 
methotrexate by cells.

 ■ BIOCHEMICAL FUNCTIONS
Folates  (as  the  intracellular  polyglutamate  derivatives)  act  as  coen-
zymes in the transfer of single-carbon units (Fig. 99-1 and Table 99-2). 
Two  of  these  reactions  are  involved  in  purine  synthesis  and  one  in 
pyrimidine synthesis necessary for DNA and RNA replication. Folate is 
also a coenzyme for methionine synthesis, in which methylcobalamin 
is also involved and in which THF is regenerated. THF is the acceptor 
of  single  carbon  units  newly  entering  the  active  pool  via  conversion 
of serine to glycine. Methionine, the other product of the methionine 
synthase reaction, is the precursor for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), 
the universal methyl donor involved in >100 methyltransferase reac-
tions (Fig. 99-1).

During  thymidylate  synthesis,  5,10-methylene-THF  is  oxidized  to 
DHF.  The  enzyme  DHF  reductase  converts  this  to  THF.  The  drugs 
methotrexate, pyrimethamine, and (mainly in bacteria) trimethoprim 
inhibit DHF reductase and so prevent formation of active THF coen-
zymes from DHF. A small fraction of the folate coenzyme is not recy-
cled during thymidylate synthesis but is degraded at the C9-N10 bond.

BIOCHEMICAL BASIS OF MEGALOBLASTIC 
ANEMIA
The common feature of all megaloblastic anemias is a defect in DNA 
synthesis  that  affects  rapidly  dividing  cells  in  the  bone  marrow.  All 
conditions that give rise to megaloblastic changes have in common a 
disparity in the rate of synthesis or availability of the four immediate 
precursors of DNA: the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs)—
dA(adenine)TP  and  dG(guanine)TP  (purines),  dT(thymine)TP,  and 
dC(cytosine)TP (pyrimidines). In deficiencies of either folate or cobal-
amin, there is failure to convert deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) 
to  deoxythymidine  monophosphate  (dTMP),  the  precursor  of  dTTP 
(Fig. 99-1). This is the case because folate is needed as the coenzyme 
5,10-methylene-THF polyglutamate for conversion of dUMP to dTMP; 
the availability of 5,10-methylene-THF is reduced in either cobalamin 
or folate deficiency. DNA replication from multiple origins along the 
chromosome is slower than normal during mitosis, and there is failure 
of joining up the incomplete replicons with resulting single-stranded 
DNA  breaks.  An  alternative  theory  for  megaloblastic  anemia  in 
cobalamin or folate deficiency is misincorporation of uracil into DNA 
because of the accumulation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) at

 ■ COBALAMIN-FOLATE RELATIONS
Folate is required for many reactions in mammalian tissues. Only two 
reactions in the body are known to require cobalamin. Methylmalonyl- 
CoA  isomerization  requires  adocobalamin,  and  the  methylation  of 
homocysteine  to  methionine  requires  both  methylcobalamin  and 
5-MTHF  (Fig.  99-1).  This  reaction  is  the  first  step  in  the  pathway 
by  which  5-MTHF,  which  enters  bone  marrow  and  other  cells  from 
plasma,  is  converted  into  all  the  intracellular  folate  coenzymes.  The 
coenzymes  are  all  polyglutamated  (the  larger  size  aiding  retention  in 
the  cell),  but  the  enzyme  folate  polyglutamate  synthase  can  use  only 
THF, not MTHF, as substrate. In cobalamin deficiency, MTHF accumu-
lates in plasma, and intracellular folate concentrations fall due to failure 
of formation of THF, the substrate on which folate polyglutamates are 
built. This has been termed THF starvation, or the methylfolate trap.

This  theory  explains  the  abnormalities  of  folate  metabolism  that 
occur in cobalamin deficiency (high serum folate, low cell folate, pos-
itive  purine  precursor  aminoimidazole  carboxamide  ribonucleotide 
[AICAR] excretion; Table 99-2) and also why the anemia of cobalamin 
deficiency responds to folic acid in large doses.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Many  symptomless  patients  are  detected  through  the  finding  of  a 
raised  mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV)  on  a  routine  blood  count. 
The  main  clinical  features  in  more  severe  cases  are  those  of  anemia. 
Anorexia is usually marked, and there may be weight loss, diarrhea, or 
constipation. Glossitis, angular cheilosis, a mild fever in more severely 
anemic patients, jaundice (unconjugated), and reversible melanin skin 
hyperpigmentation also may occur with a deficiency of either folate or 
cobalamin. Thrombocytopenia sometimes leads to bruising, and this 
may be aggravated by vitamin C deficiency or alcohol in malnourished 
patients.  The  anemia  and  low  leukocyte  count  may  predispose  to 
infections,  particularly  of  the  respiratory  and  urinary  tracts.  Cobala-
min deficiency has also been associated in a few studies with impaired 
bactericidal function of phagocytes and with osteoporosis.

Neurologic Manifestations  Vitamin B12 is needed for the myeli-
nation of the central nervous system. Its deficiency may cause a bilateral 
peripheral neuropathy or degeneration (demyelination) of the cervical 
and thoracic posterior and lateral (pyramidal) tracts of the spinal cord 
and,  less  frequently,  of  the  cranial  nerves  and  of  the  white  matter  of 
the brain. Optic atrophy and cerebral symptoms including dementia, 
depression,  psychotic  symptoms,  and  cognitive  impairment  may  be

prominent.  There  may  also  be  anosmia  and  loss  of  taste.  MRI  may 
show the “spongy” degeneration of the cord.

The patient, more frequently male, typically presents with paresthe-
sias,  muscle  weakness,  or  difficulty  in  walking  but  sometimes  may 
present with dementia, psychotic disturbances, or visual impairment. 
There  is  usually  loss  of  proprioception  and  vibration  sensation  with 
positive Romberg and Lhermitte signs. Gait may be ataxic with spas-
ticity  (hyperreflexia).  Autonomic  nervous  dysfunction  can  result  in 
postural hypotension, impotence, and incontinence.

Long-term nutritional cobalamin deficiency in infancy leads to poor 
brain development and impaired intellectual development. In infancy, 
there  may  be  feeding  difficulties,  lethargy,  and  coma.  Convulsions 
and  myoclonus  have  been  described.  An  important  clinical  problem 
is the nonanemic patient with neurologic or psychiatric abnormalities 
and a low or borderline serum cobalamin level. In such patients, it is 
necessary  to  try  to  establish  whether  there  is  significant  cobalamin 
deficiency, for example, by careful examination of the blood film, tests 
for pernicious anemia (PA) by serum gastrin level and for antibodies 
to IF or parietal cells, along with serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) 
measurement  if  available.  A  trial  of  cobalamin  therapy  for  at  least  
3 months will usually also be needed to determine whether the symp-
toms improve.

The biochemical basis for cobalamin neuropathy remains obscure. 
Its  occurrence  in  the  absence  of  methylmalonic  aciduria  in  TC  II 
deficiency  suggests  that  the  neuropathy  is  related  to  the  defect  in 
homocysteine-methionine  conversion.  Accumulation  of  S-adenosyl-
homocysteine in the brain, resulting in inhibition of transmethylation 
reactions, has been suggested. Folate deficiency has been suggested to 
cause organic nervous disease, but this is uncertain, although metho-
trexate injected into the cerebrospinal fluid may cause brain or spinal 
cord damage.

Psychiatric  disturbance  as  discussed  above  is  common  in  both 
folate  and  cobalamin  deficiencies.  This,  like  the  neuropathy,  has 
been  attributed  to  a  failure  of  the  synthesis  of  SAM,  which  is 
needed  in  methylation  of  biogenic  amines  (e.g.,  dopamine)  as  well 
as that of proteins, phospholipids, and neurotransmitters in the brain  
(Fig. 99-1). Associations between lower serum folate or cobalamin lev-
els and higher homocysteine levels and the development of decreased 
cognitive  function  and  dementia  in  Alzheimer’s  disease  have  been 
reported. A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of  
homocysteine-lowering  B-vitamin  supplementation  of  individuals 
with  and  without  cognitive  impairment,  however,  showed  that  sup-
plementation with vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid alone or in 
combination  did  not  improve  cognitive  function.  Some  studies  done 
in  China  suggest  some  cognitive  improvement  with  supplements  of 
both vitamins. It is unknown whether prolonged treatment with these 
B vitamins can reduce the risk of dementia in later life.

 ■ GENERAL TISSUE EFFECTS OF COBALAMIN AND 
FOLATE DEFICIENCIES
Epithelial  Surfaces  After  the  marrow,  the  next  most  frequently 
affected  tissues  are  the  epithelial  cell  surfaces  of  the  mouth  (with 
glossitis),  stomach,  and  small  intestine  and  the  respiratory,  urinary, 
and female genital tracts. The cells show macrocytosis, with increased 
numbers of multinucleate and dying cells. The deficiencies may cause 
cervical smear abnormalities.

Complications of Pregnancy  The gonads are also affected, and 
infertility is common in both men and women with severe deficiency 
of either vitamin. Maternal folate deficiency has been implicated as a 
cause  of  prematurity,  and  both  folate  deficiency  and  cobalamin  defi-
ciency  have  been  implicated  in  recurrent  fetal  loss  and  neural  tube 
defects, as discussed below.

Neural Tube Defects  Folic acid supplements at the time of concep-
tion and in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy reduce by ∼70% the incidence 
of neural tube defects (NTDs) (anencephaly, meningomyelocele, enceph-
alocele, and spina bifida) in the fetus. Most of this protective effect can 
be achieved by taking folic acid, 0.4 mg daily, at the time of conception.

The  incidence  of  cleft  palate  and  harelip  also  can  be  reduced  by 
prophylactic folic acid. There is no clear simple relationship between 
maternal folate status and these fetal abnormalities, although overall, 
the lower the maternal folate, the greater is the risk to the fetus. NTDs 
also can be caused by antifolate and antiepileptic drugs.

An underlying maternal folate metabolic abnormality has also been 
postulated.  One  abnormality  has  been  identified:  reduced  activity  of 
the  enzyme  5,10-methylene-THF  reductase  (MTHFR)  (Fig.  99-1) 
caused  by  a  common  C677T  polymorphism  in  the  MTHFR  gene.  In 
one study, the prevalence of this polymorphism was found to be higher 
than in controls in the parents of NTD fetuses and in the fetuses them-
selves: homozygosity for the TT mutation was found in 13% of cases 
compared with 5% of control subjects. The polymorphism codes for a 
thermolabile form of MTHFR. The homozygous state results in a lower 
mean serum and red cell folate level compared with control subjects, as 
well as significantly higher serum homocysteine levels. Tests for muta-
tions  in  other  enzymes  possibly  associated  with  NTDs,  for  example, 
methionine synthase and serine–glycine hydroxymethylase, have been 
negative. Serum vitamin B12 levels are also lower in the sera of mothers 
of NTD infants than in controls. In addition, maternal TC II receptor 
polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of NTD births. How-
ever, no studies show that dietary fortification with vitamin B12 reduces 
the incidence of NTDs.
Cardiovascular  Disease  Children  with  severe  homocystinuria 
(blood levels ≥100 μmol/L) due to deficiency of one of three enzymes 
(methionine synthase, MTHFR, or cystathionine synthase; Fig. 99-1) 
have vascular disease, for example, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovas-
cular disease, or pulmonary embolus, as teenagers or in young adult-
hood. Lesser degrees of raised serum homocysteine and low levels of 
serum  folate  and  homozygous  inherited  mutations  of  MTHFR  have 
been found to be associated with cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, 
and coronary heart disease and with deep vein thrombosis. Prospective 
randomized  trials  of  lowering  homocysteine  levels  with  supplements 
of folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 against placebo over a 5-year 
period in patients with vascular disease or diabetes have not, however, 
shown a reduction of first event fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
nor have these supplements reduced the risk of recurrent cardiovascu-
lar disease after an acute myocardial infarct. Meta-analysis showed an 
18% reduction in strokes. The benefit for stroke prevention has been 
confirmed by a large (>20,000 subjects) randomized prospective study 
in hypertensive subjects in China. This showed a significant reduction 
in the first incidence of stroke in subjects receiving enalapril and folic 
acid compared to enalapril alone. The effect was especially marked in 
the subjects commencing the prospective trial with the lowest serum 
folate levels. Venous thrombosis has been reported to be more frequent 
in  folate-deficient  or  vitamin  B12–deficient  subjects  than  in  controls 
and  to  occur  at  unusual  sites  such  as  cerebral  venous  sinuses.  This 
tendency was ascribed to raised plasma homocysteine levels in folate 
or vitamin B12 deficiency.
Malignancy  Prophylactic  folic  acid  in  pregnancy  has  been  found 
in some but not all studies to reduce the subsequent incidence of acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  in  childhood.  A  significant  negative 
association  has  also  been  found  with  the  MTHFR  C677T  polymor-
phism  and  leukemias  with  mixed  lineage  leukemia  (MLL)  transloca-
tions, but a positive association was found with hyperdiploidy in infants 
with ALL or acute myeloid leukemia or with childhood ALL. A second 
polymorphism in the MTHFR gene, A1298C, is also strongly associated 
with hyperdiploid leukemia. Various positive and negative associations 
are  noted  between  polymorphisms  in  folate-dependent  enzymes  and 
the  incidence  of  adult  ALL.  The  C677T  polymorphism  is  thought  to 
lead to increased thymidine pools and “better quality” of DNA synthesis 
by shunting one-carbon groups toward thymidine and purine synthesis. 
This may explain its reported association with a lower risk for colorectal 
cancer. Most but not all studies suggest that prophylactic folic acid also 
protects against colon adenomas. Other tumors that have been associ-
ated with folate polymorphisms or status include follicular lymphoma, 
breast cancer, and gastric cancer. A meta-analysis of 50,000 individuals 
given folic acid (0.5–40 mg daily) or placebo in cardiovascular or colon

adenoma  prevention  trials  found  that  folic  acid  supplementation  did 
not  significantly  increase  or  decrease  the  overall  incidence  of  cancer 
or  of  any  site-specific  cancer  during  a  weighted  average  scheduled 
treatment duration of 5.7 years. Because folic acid may “feed” tumors, 
it probably should be avoided in those with established tumors unless 
there is severe megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.

HEMATOLOGIC FINDINGS
 ■ PERIPHERAL BLOOD
Oval macrocytes, usually with considerable anisocytosis and poikilo-
cytosis, are the main feature (Fig. 99-2A). The MCV is usually >100 fL  
unless  a  cause  of  microcytosis  (e.g.,  iron  deficiency  or  thalassemia 
trait)  is  present.  Some  of  the  neutrophils  are  hypersegmented  (more 
than five nuclear lobes). There may be leukopenia due to a reduction 
in  granulocytes  and  lymphocytes,  but  this  is  usually  >1.5  ×  109/L; 
the platelet count may be moderately reduced, rarely to <40 × 109/L. 
The severity of all these changes parallels the degree of anemia. In a 
nonanemic  patient,  the  presence  of  a  few  macrocytes  and  hyperseg-
mented neutrophils in the peripheral blood may be the only indication 
of the underlying disorder.

 ■ BONE MARROW
In a severely anemic patient, the marrow is hypercellular with an accu-
mulation of primitive cells due to selective death by apoptosis of more 
mature forms. The erythroblast nucleus maintains a primitive appear-
ance despite maturation and hemoglobinization of the cytoplasm. The 
cells  are  larger  than  normoblasts,  and  an  increased  number  of  cells 
with  eccentric  lobulated  nuclei  or  nuclear  fragments  may  be  present  
(Fig.  99-2B).  Giant  and  abnormally  shaped  metamyelocytes  and 
enlarged  hyperpolyploid  megakaryocytes  are  characteristic.  In  severe 
cases, the accumulation of primitive cells may mimic acute myeloid leu-
kemia, whereas in less anemic patients, the changes in the marrow may 
be difficult to recognize. The terms intermediate, mild, and early have 
been used. The term megaloblastoid does not mean mildly megaloblas-
tic. It is used to describe cells with both immature-appearing nuclei and 
defective hemoglobinization and is usually seen in myelodysplasia.

 ■ CHROMOSOMES
Bone marrow cells, transformed lymphocytes, and other proliferating 
cells in the body show a variety of changes, including random breaks, 
reduced contraction, spreading of the centromere, and exaggeration of 

secondary  chromosomal  constrictions  and  overprominent  satellites. 
Similar abnormalities may be produced by antimetabolite drugs (e.g., 
cytosine  arabinoside,  hydroxyurea,  and  methotrexate)  that  interfere 
with either DNA replication or folate metabolism and that also cause 
megaloblastic appearances.
 ■ INEFFECTIVE HEMATOPOIESIS
Unconjugated  bilirubin  accumulates  in  plasma  due  to  the  death  of 
nucleated  red  cells  in  the  marrow  (ineffective  erythropoiesis).  Other 
evidence  for  this  includes  raised  urine  urobilinogen,  reduced  hapto-
globins  and  positive  urine  hemosiderin,  and  a  raised  serum  lactate 
dehydrogenase. A weakly positive direct antiglobulin test due to com-
plement can lead to a false diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

CAUSES OF COBALAMIN DEFICIENCY
Cobalamin deficiency is usually due to malabsorption. The only other 
cause is inadequate dietary intake.
 ■ INADEQUATE DIETARY INTAKE
Adults  Dietary  cobalamin  deficiency  arises  in  vegans  who  omit 
meat,  fish,  eggs,  cheese,  and  other  animal  products  from  their  diet. 
The largest group in the world consists of Hindus, and it is likely that 
many  millions  of  Indians  are  at  risk  of  deficiency  of  cobalamin  on  a 
nutritional basis. Subnormal serum cobalamin levels are found in up 
to 50% of randomly selected, young, adult Indian vegans, but the defi-
ciency usually does not progress to megaloblastic anemia since the diet 
of most vegans is not totally lacking in cobalamin and the enterohe-
patic circulation of cobalamin is intact. Dietary cobalamin deficiency 
may also arise rarely in nonvegetarian individuals who exist on grossly 
inadequate diets because of poverty or psychiatric disturbance.

Infants  Cobalamin  deficiency  has  been  described  in  infants  born 
to severely cobalamin-deficient mothers. These infants develop meg-
aloblastic anemia at about 3–6 months of age, presumably because they 
are born with low stores of cobalamin and because they are fed breast 
milk with low cobalamin content. The babies have also shown growth 
retardation, impaired psychomotor development, and other neurologic 
sequelae. MRI shows delayed myelination and atrophy.

Intestinal causes

Formerly, the pathogenesis of B12 malabsorption was distinguishable 
based on the results of a Schilling test in which a radioactive form of 
B12 was administered orally and its appearance in the urine was a sign 
of absorption. Radioactive B12 is no longer available, and Schilling tests 
are no longer performed. Other approaches to the differential diagnosis 
of B12 malabsorption are now employed.
Pernicious Anemia  PA may be defined as a severe lack of IF due 
to  gastric  atrophy.  It  is  a  common  disease  in  northern  Europeans  but 
occurs in all countries and ethnic groups. It is more frequent in people 
of African than Asian ancestry. The overall incidence is about 120 per 
100,000 population in the United Kingdom (UK). The ratio of incidence 
in  men  and  women  among  whites  is  ∼1:1.6,  and  the  median  age  of 
onset is 70–80 years, with only 10% of patients being <40 years of age. 
However, in some ethnic groups, notably blacks and Latin Americans, 
the  age  at  onset  of  PA  is  generally  lower.  The  disease  occurs  more 
commonly than by chance in close relatives and in persons with other 
organ-specific  autoimmune  diseases,  for  example,  thyroid  diseases, 
vitiligo, hypoparathyroidism, type 1 diabetes, and Addison’s disease. It 
is also associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, premature graying or 
blue eyes, and persons of blood group A. An association with human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) 3 has been reported in some but not all series 
and, in those with endocrine disease, with HLA-B8, -B12, and -BW15. 
Life expectancy is normal in women once regular treatment has begun. 
Men  had  a  slightly  subnormal  life  expectancy  as  a  result  of  a  higher 
incidence  of  carcinoma  of  the  stomach  than  in  control  subjects,  but

of  hydrochloric  acid,  pepsin,  and  IF  is  severely  reduced.  The  serum

Gastric Biopsy  A single endoscopic examination is recommended 
if PA is diagnosed. Gastric biopsy usually shows atrophy of all layers 
of  the  body  and  fundus,  with  loss  of  glandular  elements,  an  absence 
of  parietal  and  chief  cells  and  replacement  by  mucous  cells,  a  mixed 
inflammatory  cell  infiltrate,  and  perhaps  intestinal  metaplasia.  The 
infiltrate of plasma cells and lymphocytes contains an excess of CD4 
cells.  These  are  directed  against  gastric  H/K-ATPase.  The  antral 
mucosa is usually well preserved. Helicobacter pylori infection occurs 
infrequently  in  PA,  but  it  has  been  suggested  that  H.  pylori  gastritis 
occurs at an early phase of atrophic gastritis and presents in younger 
patients as iron-deficiency anemia but in older patients as PA. H. pylori 
is suggested to stimulate an autoimmune process directed against pari-
etal cells, with the H. pylori infection then being gradually replaced, in 
some individuals, by an autoimmune process.

Serum Antibodies  Two types of IF immunoglobulin G antibody 
may be found in the sera of patients with PA. The “blocking,” or type 
I,  antibody  prevents  the  combination  of  IF  and  cobalamin,  whereas 
the  “binding,”  or  type  II,  antibody  prevents  attachment  of  IF  to  ileal 
mucosa. Type I occurs in the sera of ∼55% of patients, and type II in 
35%. IF antibodies cross the placenta and may cause temporary IF defi-
ciency in a newborn infant. Patients with PA also show cell-mediated 
immunity to IF. Type I antibody has been detected rarely in the sera of 
patients without PA but with thyrotoxicosis, myxedema, Hashimoto’s 
disease,  or  diabetes  mellitus  and  in  relatives  of  PA  patients.  IF  anti-
bodies also have been detected in gastric juice in ∼80% of PA patients. 
These gastric antibodies may reduce absorption of dietary cobalamin 
by combining with small amounts of remaining IF.

Parietal cell antibody is present in the sera of almost 90% of adult 
patients  with  PA  but  is  frequently  present  in  other  subjects.  Thus,  it 
occurs  in  as  many  as  16%  of  randomly  selected  female  subjects  age  
>60  years.  The  parietal  cell  antibody  is  directed  against  the  α  and  β 
subunits of the gastric proton pump (H+, K+-ATPase).

 ■ JUVENILE PERNICIOUS ANEMIA
This  usually  occurs  in  older  children  and  resembles  PA  of  adults. 
Gastric atrophy, achlorhydria, and serum IF antibodies are all present, 
although  parietal  cell  antibodies  are  usually  absent.  About  one-half 
of these patients show an associated endocrinopathy such as autoim-
mune thyroiditis, Addison’s disease, or hypoparathyroidism; in some, 
mucocutaneous candidiasis occurs.

 ■ CONGENITAL INTRINSIC FACTOR DEFICIENCY 
OR FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITY
An  affected  child  usually  presents  with  megaloblastic  anemia  in  the 
first  to  third  year  of  life;  a  few  have  presented  as  late  as  the  second 
decade.  The  child  usually  has  no  demonstrable  IF  but  has  a  normal 
gastric mucosa and normal secretion of acid. The inheritance is auto-
somal recessive. Parietal cell and IF antibodies are absent. Variants have 
been described in which the child is born with IF that can be detected 
immunologically  but  is  unstable  or  functionally  inactive,  unable  to 
bind cobalamin or to facilitate its uptake by ileal receptors.

 ■ GASTRECTOMY
After  total  gastrectomy,  cobalamin  deficiency  is  inevitable,  and  pro-
phylactic  cobalamin  therapy  should  be  commenced  immediately 
after the operation. After partial gastrectomy, 10–15% of patients also 
develop  this  deficiency.  The  exact  incidence  and  time  of  onset  are 
most influenced by the size of the resection and the preexisting size of 
cobalamin body stores.

 ■ FOOD COBALAMIN MALABSORPTION
Failure  of  release  of  cobalamin  from  binding  proteins  in  food  is 
believed to be responsible for this condition, which is more common 
in  the  elderly.  It  is  associated  with  low  serum  cobalamin  levels,  with 
or without raised serum levels of MMA and homocysteine. Typically,

these  patients  have  normal  cobalamin  absorption,  as  measured  with 
crystalline cobalamin, but show malabsorption when a modified test 
using food-bound cobalamin is used. It is usually due to mild forms 
of atrophic gastritis or therapy with proton pump inhibitors. Bariatric 
surgery is likely to be an increasing cause of this form of B12 malabsorp-
tion and deficiency. The frequency of progression to severe cobalamin 
deficiency and the reasons for this progression are not clear.

 ■ INTESTINAL CAUSES OF COBALAMIN 
MALABSORPTION
Intestinal Stagnant Loop Syndrome  Malabsorption of cobala-
min occurs in a variety of intestinal lesions in which there is coloniza-
tion of the upper small intestine by fecal organisms. This may occur in 
patients with jejunal diverticulosis, enteroanastomosis, or an intestinal 
stricture or fistula or with an anatomic blind loop due to Crohn’s dis-
ease, tuberculosis, or an operative procedure.

Ileal  Resection  Removal  of  ≥1.2  m  of  terminal  ileum  causes 
malabsorption  of  cobalamin.  In  some  patients  after  ileal  resection, 
particularly if the ileocecal valve is incompetent, colonic bacteria may 
contribute further to the onset of cobalamin deficiency.

Selective  Malabsorption  of  Cobalamin  with  Proteinuria 
(Imerslund’s  Syndrome;  Imerslund-Gräsbeck  Syndrome; 
Congenital  Cobalamin  Malabsorption;  Autosomal  Recessive 
Megaloblastic  Anemia;  MGA1)  This  autosomal  recessive  dis-
ease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  megaloblastic  anemia  due  to 
cobalamin deficiency in infancy in Western countries. More than 200 
cases have been reported with familial clusters in Finland, Norway, the 
Middle East, and North Africa. The patients secrete normal amounts 
of IF and gastric acid but are unable to absorb cobalamin. In Finland, 
impaired  synthesis,  processing,  or  ligand  binding  of  cubilin  due  to 
inherited  mutations  is  found.  In  Norway,  mutation  of  the  gene  for 
AMN has been reported. Other tests of intestinal absorption are nor-
mal. Over 90% of these patients show nonspecific proteinuria, but renal 
function is otherwise normal, and renal biopsy has not shown any con-
sistent renal defect. A few have shown aminoaciduria and congenital 
renal abnormalities, such as duplication of the renal pelvis.

Tropical Sprue  Nearly all patients with acute and subacute trop-
ical  sprue  show  malabsorption  of  cobalamin;  this  may  persist  as  the 
principal  abnormality  in  the  chronic  form  of  the  disease,  when  the 
patient may present with megaloblastic anemia or neuropathy due to 
cobalamin deficiency. Absorption of cobalamin usually improves after 
antibiotic therapy and, in the early stages, folic acid therapy.

Fish  Tapeworm  Infestation  The  fish  tapeworm  (Diphylloboth-
rium  latum)  lives  in  the  small  intestine  of  humans  and  accumulates 
cobalamin from food, rendering the cobalamin unavailable for absorp-
tion. Individuals acquire the worm by eating raw or partly cooked fish. 
Infestation  is  common  around  the  lakes  of  Scandinavia,  Germany, 
Japan, North America, and Russia. Megaloblastic anemia or cobalamin 
neuropathy occurs only in those with a heavy infestation.

Gluten-Induced  Enteropathy  Malabsorption  of  cobalamin 
occurs in ∼30% of untreated patients (presumably those in whom the 
disease  extends  to  the  ileum).  Cobalamin  deficiency  is  not  severe  in 
these patients and is corrected with a gluten-free diet.

Severe  Chronic  Pancreatitis 
In  this  condition,  lack  of  trypsin 
is  thought  to  cause  dietary  cobalamin  attached  to  gastric  non-IF  (R) 
binder to be unavailable for absorption. It also has been proposed that 
in  pancreatitis,  the  concentration  of  calcium  ions  in  the  ileum  falls 
below the level needed to maintain normal cobalamin absorption.

HIV Infection  Serum cobalamin levels tend to fall in patients with 
HIV infection and are subnormal in 10–35% of those with AIDS. Mal-
absorption of cobalamin not corrected by IF has been shown in some, 
but  not  all,  patients  with  subnormal  serum  cobalamin  levels.  Cobal-
amin  deficiency  sufficiently  severe  to  cause  megaloblastic  anemia  or 
neuropathy is rare.

Zollinger-Ellison  Syndrome  Malabsorption  of  cobalamin  has 
been  reported  in  the  Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome.  It  is  thought  that 
there is a failure to release cobalamin from R-binding protein due to 
inactivation of pancreatic trypsin by high acidity, as well as interference 
with IF binding of cobalamin.

Radiotherapy  Both  total-body  irradiation  and  local  radiotherapy 
to the ileum (e.g., as a complication of radiotherapy for carcinoma of 
the cervix) may cause malabsorption of cobalamin.

Graft-versus-Host  Disease  This  commonly  affects  the  small 
intestine.  Malabsorption  of  cobalamin  due  to  abnormal  gut  flora,  as 
well as damage to ileal mucosa, is common.

Drugs  The  drugs  that  have  been  reported  to  cause  malabsorption 
of cobalamin are listed in Table 99-4. However, megaloblastic anemia 
due to these drugs is rare. It has been suggested that metformin lowers 
serum  B12  by  lowering  TC  I  level  rather  than  causing  malabsorption 
of B12.
 ■ ABNORMALITIES OF COBALAMIN METABOLISM
Congenital  Transcobalamin  II  Deficiency  or  Abnormality  
Infants with TC II deficiency usually present with megaloblastic ane-
mia within a few weeks of birth. Serum cobalamin and folate levels are 
normal,  but  the  anemia  responds  to  massive  (e.g.,  1  mg  three  times 
weekly)  injections  of  cobalamin.  Some  cases  show  neurologic  com-
plications. The protein may be present but functionally inert. Genetic 
abnormalities found include mutations of an intraexonic cryptic splice 
site, extensive deletion, single nucleotide deletion, nonsense mutation, 
and an RNA editing defect. Malabsorption of cobalamin occurs in all 
cases,  and  serum  immunoglobulins  are  usually  reduced.  Failure  to 
institute adequate cobalamin therapy or treatment with folic acid may 
lead to neurologic damage.

Congenital  Methylmalonic  Acidemia  and  Aciduria 
Infants 
with this abnormality are ill from birth with vomiting, failure to thrive, 
severe metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and mental retardation. Anemia, if 
present,  is  normocytic  and  normoblastic.  The  condition  may  be  due 
to  a  functional  defect  in  either  mitochondrial  methylmalonyl-CoA 
mutase or its cofactor adocobalamin. Mutations in the methylmalonyl- 
CoA  mutase  are  not  responsive  or  are  only  poorly  responsive  to 
treatment  with  cobalamin.  A  proportion  of  infants  with  failure  of 
adocobalamin  synthesis  respond  to  cobalamin  in  large  doses.  Some 
children have combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria 
due to defective formation of both cobalamin coenzymes. This usually 
presents in the first year of life with feeding difficulties, developmental 
delay, microcephaly, seizures, hypotonia, and megaloblastic anemia.

Acquired  Abnormality  of  Cobalamin  Metabolism:  Nitrous 
Oxide Inhalation  Nitrous oxide (N2O) irreversibly oxidizes meth-
ylcobalamin  to  an  inactive  precursor;  this  inactivates  methionine 
synthase.  Megaloblastic  anemia  has  occurred  in  patients  undergoing 
prolonged N2O anesthesia (e.g., in intensive care units). A neuropathy 
resembling cobalamin neuropathy has been described in dentists and 
anesthetists  who  are  exposed  repeatedly  to  N2O.  Methylmalonic  aci-
duria does not occur as adocobalamin is not inactivated by N2O.

CAUSES OF FOLATE DEFICIENCY
(Table 99-5)
 ■ NUTRITIONAL
Dietary  folate  deficiency  is  common.  Indeed,  in  most  patients  with 
folate deficiency, a nutritional element is present. Certain individuals 
are  particularly  prone  to  have  diets  containing  inadequate  amounts 
of folate (Table 99-5). In the United States and other countries where 
fortification  of  the  diet  with  folic  acid  has  been  adopted,  the  preva-
lence of folate deficiency has dropped dramatically and is now almost 
restricted to high-risk groups with increased folate needs. Nutritional 
folate deficiency occurs in kwashiorkor and scurvy and in infants with 
repeated infections or those who are fed solely on goats’ milk, which 
has a low folate content.

 ■ MALABSORPTION
Malabsorption of dietary folate occurs in tropical sprue and in gluten- 
induced  enteropathy.  In  the  rare  congenital  recessive  syndrome  of 
selective  malabsorption  of  folate  due  to  mutation  of  the  PCFT,  there 
is an associated defect of folate transport into the cerebrospinal fluid, 
and  these  patients  show  megaloblastic  anemia,  which  responds  to 
physiologic doses of folic acid given parenterally but not orally. They 
also show mental retardation, convulsions, and other central nervous 
system abnormalities. Minor degrees of malabsorption may also occur 
after jejunal resection or partial gastrectomy, in Crohn’s disease, and in 
systemic infections, but in these conditions, if severe deficiency occurs, 
it  is  usually  largely  due  to  poor  nutrition.  Malabsorption  of  folate 
has  been  described  in  patients  receiving  sulfasalazine  (Salazopyrin), 
cholestyramine, and triamterene.

 ■ EXCESS UTILIZATION OR LOSS
Pregnancy  Folate  requirements  are  increased  by  200–300  μg  to 
∼400 μg daily in a normal pregnancy, partly because of transfer of the 
vitamin to the fetus but mainly because of increased folate catabolism 
due  to  cleavage  of  folate  coenzymes  in  rapidly  proliferating  tissues. 
Megaloblastic  anemia  due  to  this  deficiency  is  prevented  by  prophy-
lactic folic acid therapy. It occurred in 0.5% of pregnancies in the UK 
and other Western countries before prophylaxis with folic acid, but the 
incidence  is  much  higher  in  countries  where  the  general  nutritional 
status is poor.

Prematurity  A  newborn  infant,  whether  full  term  or  premature, 
has higher serum and red cell folate concentrations than does an adult. 
However, a newborn infant’s demand for folate has been estimated to

be  up  to  10  times  that  of  adults  on  a  weight  basis,  and  the  neonatal 
folate  level  falls  rapidly  to  the  lowest  values  at  about  6  weeks  of  age.  
The falls are steepest and are liable to reach subnormal levels in prema-
ture babies, a number of whom develop megaloblastic anemia respon-
sive to folic acid at about 4–6 weeks of age. This occurs particularly in 
the smallest babies (<1500 g birth weight) and those who have feeding 
difficulties or infections or have undergone multiple exchange transfu-
sions. In these babies, prophylactic folic acid should be given.

Hematologic  Disorders  Folate  deficiency  frequently  occurs  in 
chronic hemolytic anemia, particularly in sickle cell disease, autoim-
mune  hemolytic  anemia,  and  congenital  spherocytosis.  In  these  and 
other conditions of increased cell turnover (e.g., myelofibrosis, malig-
nancies), folate deficiency arises because it is not completely reutilized 
after performing coenzyme functions.

Inflammatory  Conditions  Chronic  inflammatory  diseases  such 
as tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, exfoli-
ative dermatitis, bacterial endocarditis, and chronic bacterial infections 
cause deficiency by reducing the appetite and increasing the demand 
for folate. Systemic infections also may cause malabsorption of folate. 
Severe  deficiency  is  virtually  confined  to  the  patients  with  the  most 
active disease and the poorest diet.

Homocystinuria  This is a rare metabolic defect in the conversion 
of homocysteine to cystathionine. Folate deficiency occurring in most 
of these patients may be due to excessive utilization because of com-
pensatory increased conversion of homocysteine to methionine.

Long-Term  Dialysis  Because  folate  is  only  loosely  bound  to 
plasma  proteins,  it  is  easily  removed  from  plasma  by  dialysis.  In 
patients  with  anorexia,  vomiting,  infections,  and  hemolysis,  folate 
stores  are  particularly  likely  to  become  depleted.  Routine  folate  pro-
phylaxis is now given.

Congestive  Heart  Failure  and  Liver  Disease  Excess  urinary 
folate losses of >100 μg per day may occur in some of these patients. 
The  explanation  appears  to  be  release  of  folate  from  damaged  liver 
cells.

 ■ ANTIFOLATE DRUGS
A large number of epileptics who are receiving long-term therapy with 
phenytoin  or  primidone,  with  or  without  barbiturates,  develop  low 
serum and red cell folate levels. The exact mechanism is unclear. Alco-
hol may also be a folate antagonist, as patients who are drinking spirits 
may develop megaloblastic anemia that will respond to normal quanti-
ties of dietary folate or to physiologic doses of folic acid only if alcohol 
is withdrawn. Macrocytosis of red cells is associated with chronic alco-
hol intake even when folate levels are normal. Inadequate folate intake 
is the major factor in the development of deficiency in spirit-drinking 
alcoholics. Beer is relatively folate-rich in some countries, depending 
on the technique used for brewing.

The  drugs  that  inhibit  DHF  reductase  include  methotrexate, 
pyrimethamine,  and  trimethoprim.  Methotrexate  has  the  most  pow-
erful action against the human enzyme, whereas trimethoprim is most 
active against the bacterial enzyme and is likely to cause megaloblastic 
anemia  only  when  used  in  conjunction  with  sulfamethoxazole  in 
patients with preexisting folate or cobalamin deficiency. The activity of 
pyrimethamine is intermediate. The antidote to these drugs is folinic 
acid (5-formyl-THF).

 ■ CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES OF FOLATE 
METABOLISM
Some infants with congenital defects of folate enzymes (e.g., cyclohy-
drolase or methionine synthase) have had megaloblastic anemia.

DIAGNOSIS OF COBALAMIN AND FOLATE 
DEFICIENCIES
The  diagnosis  of  cobalamin  or  folate  deficiency  has  traditionally 
depended  on  the  recognition  of  the  relevant  abnormalities  in  the 
peripheral blood and analysis of the blood levels of the vitamins.

 ■ COBALAMIN DEFICIENCY
Serum  Cobalamin  This  is  measured  by  an  automated  enzyme-
linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  or  competitive-binding  lumines-
cence assay (CBLA). Normal serum levels range from 118–148 pmol/L 
(160–200  ng/L)  to  ∼738  pmol/L  (1000  ng/L).  In  patients  with  meg-
aloblastic anemia due to cobalamin deficiency, the level is usually <74 
pmol/L (100 ng/L). In general, the more severe the deficiency, the lower 
is the serum cobalamin level. In patients with spinal cord damage due 
to  the  deficiency,  levels  are  very  low  even  in  the  absence  of  anemia. 
Values between 74 and 148 pmol/L (100 and 200 ng/L) are regarded as 
borderline. They may occur, for instance, in pregnancy, in patients with 
megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency. They may also be due 
to heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous mutations 
of the gene TCN1 that codes for HC (TC I). There is then no clinical 
or hematologic abnormality. The serum cobalamin level is sufficiently 
robust, cost-effective, and most convenient to rule out cobalamin defi-
ciency in the vast majority of patients suspected of having this problem. 
However, problems have arisen with commercial CBLA assays involv-
ing  IF  in  PA  patients  with  intrinsic  antibodies  in  serum.  These  anti-
bodies may cause false normal serum vitamin B12 levels in up to 50% 
of cases tested. Where clinical indications of PA are strong, a normal 
serum vitamin B12 does not rule out the diagnosis. Serum MMA levels 
will be elevated in untreated PA (see below).

Folate  deficiency,  TC  I  (HC)  deficiency,  oral  contraceptives,  and 
multiple myeloma have all been associated with low serum B12 levels 
that do not indicate B12 deficiency. On the other hand, high serum B12 
levels are usually due to raised serum TC I levels and can be due to the 
presence of liver, renal, or myeloproliferative diseases or to cancer of 
the breast, colon, or liver.

Serum  Methylmalonate  and  Homocysteine 
In  patients  with 
cobalamin  deficiency  sufficient  to  cause  anemia  or  neuropathy,  the 
serum  MMA  level  is  raised.  Sensitive  methods  for  measuring  MMA 
and homocysteine in serum have been introduced and recommended 
for the early diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency, even in the absence of 
hematologic  abnormalities  or  subnormal  levels  of  serum  cobalamin. 
Serum  MMA  levels  fluctuate,  however,  in  patients  with  renal  failure. 
Mildly elevated serum MMA and/or homocysteine levels occur in up 
to 30% of apparently healthy volunteers, with serum cobalamin levels 
up to 258 pmol/L (350 ng/L) and normal serum folate levels; 15% of 
elderly subjects, even with cobalamin levels >258 pmol/L (>350 ng/L), 
have this pattern of raised metabolite levels. These findings bring into 
question the exact cutoff points for normal MMA and homocysteine 
levels. It is also unclear at present whether these mildly raised metabo-
lite levels have clinical consequences.

Serum  homocysteine  is  raised  in  both  early  cobalamin  and  folate 
deficiency but may be raised in other conditions, for example, chronic 
renal  disease,  alcoholism,  smoking,  pyridoxine  deficiency,  hypothy-
roidism,  and  therapy  with  steroids,  cyclosporine,  and  other  drugs. 
Levels are also higher in serum than in plasma, in men than in pre-
menopausal women, in women taking hormone replacement therapy 
or  in  oral  contraceptive  users,  and  in  elderly  persons  and  patients 
with several inborn errors of metabolism affecting enzymes in trans- 
sulfuration  pathways  of  homocysteine  metabolism.  Thus,  homo-
cysteine levels must be carefully interpreted for diagnosis of cobalamin 
or folate deficiency.

Tests  for  the  Cause  of  Cobalamin  Deficiency  Only  vegans, 
strict  vegetarians,  or  people  living  on  a  totally  inadequate  diet  will 
become vitamin B12 deficient because of inadequate intake. Studies of 
cobalamin absorption once were widely used, but difficulty in obtain-
ing radioactive cobalamin and ensuring that IF preparations are free 
of viruses has made these tests obsolete. Tests to diagnose PA include 
serum gastrin, which is raised; serum pepsinogen I, which is low in PA 
(90–92%) but also in other conditions; and gastric endoscopy. Tests for 
IF and parietal cell antibodies are also used, as well as tests for individ-
ual intestinal diseases.

Patients with atrophic gastritis may also have sufficient occult gas-
trointestinal blood loss to have iron deficiency as well as vitamin B12 

deficiency. Iron deficiency may blunt the development of macrocytosis 
when  iron  deficiency  and  B12  deficiency  coexist.  Iron  deficiency  is 
much more common than B12 deficiency, and in people older than age 
60 years, B12 deficiency may accompany iron deficiency in 15–20% of 
cases.  Thus,  patients  diagnosed  with  iron-deficiency  anemia  should 
have B12 levels assessed, and those diagnosed with B12 deficiency should 
have their iron status assessed.

 ■ FOLATE DEFICIENCY
Serum  Folate  This  is  also  measured  by  an  ELISA  technique.  In 
most  laboratories,  the  normal  range  is  from  11  nmol/L  (2  μg/L)  to  
∼82  nmol/L  (15  μg/L).  The  serum  folate  level  is  low  in  all  folate- 
deficient  patients.  It  also  reflects  recent  diet.  Because  of  this,  serum 
folate may be low before there is hematologic or biochemical evidence 
of deficiency. Serum folate rises in severe cobalamin deficiency because 
of the block in conversion of MTHF to THF inside cells; raised levels 
have also been reported in the intestinal stagnant loop syndrome due 
to absorption of bacterially synthesized folate.

Red Cell Folate  The red cell folate assay is a valuable test of body 
folate stores. It is less affected than the serum assay by recent diet and 
traces of hemolysis. In normal adults, concentrations range from 880 
to 3520 μmol/L (160–640 μg/L) of packed red cells. Subnormal levels 
occur  in  patients  with  megaloblastic  anemia  due  to  folate  deficiency 
but  also  in  nearly  two-thirds  of  patients  with  severe  cobalamin  defi-
ciency. False-normal results may occur if a folate-deficient patient has 
received a recent blood transfusion or if a patient has a raised reticulo-
cyte count. Serum homocysteine assay is discussed earlier.

Tests  for  the  Cause  of  Folate  Deficiency  The  diet  history  is 
important. Tests for transglutaminase antibodies are performed to con-
firm or exclude celiac disease. If positive, duodenal biopsy is needed. 
An underlying disease causing increased folate breakdown should also 
be excluded.

TREATMENT
Cobalamin and Folate Deficiency

It is usually possible to establish which of the two deficiencies, folate 
or cobalamin, is the cause of the anemia and to treat only with the 
appropriate vitamin. In patients who enter the hospital severely ill, 
however,  it  may  be  necessary  to  treat  with  both  vitamins  in  large 
doses once blood samples have been taken for cobalamin and folate 
assays and a bone marrow biopsy has been performed (if deemed 
necessary). Transfusion is usually unnecessary and inadvisable. If it 
is essential, packed red cells should be given slowly, one or two units 
only, with the usual treatment for heart failure if present. Potassium 
supplements have been recommended to obviate the danger of the 
hypokalemia but are not necessary. Occasionally, an excessive rise 
in platelets occurs after 1–2 weeks of therapy. Antiplatelet therapy, 
for example, aspirin, should be considered if the platelet count rises 
to >800 × 109/L. 

COBALAMIN DEFICIENCY
It is usually necessary to treat patients who have developed cobal-
amin deficiency with lifelong regular cobalamin injections. In the 
UK,  the  form  used  is  hydroxocobalamin;  in  the  United  States, 
cyanocobalamin. In a few instances, the underlying cause of cobal-
amin  deficiency  can  be  permanently  corrected,  for  example,  fish 
tapeworm,  tropical  sprue,  or  an  intestinal  stagnant  loop  that  is 
amenable to surgery. The indications for starting cobalamin therapy 
are a well-documented megaloblastic anemia or other hematologic 
abnormalities and neuropathy due to the deficiency. Patients with 
borderline  serum  cobalamin  levels  but  no  hematologic  or  other 
abnormality may be followed to make sure that the cobalamin defi-
ciency does not progress (see below). If malabsorption of cobalamin 
or  rises  in  serum  MMA  levels  have  been  demonstrated,  however, 
these patients also should be given regular maintenance cobalamin

PART 4Oncology and Hematologytherapy.  Cobalamin  should  be  given  routinely  to  all  patients  who 
have had a total gastrectomy or ileal resection. Patients who have 
undergone  gastric  reduction  for  control  of  obesity  or  who  are 
receiving long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors should 
be screened and, if necessary, given cobalamin replacement.

Replenishment  of  body  stores  should  be  complete  with  six   
1000-μg  IM  injections  of  hydroxocobalamin  given  at  3-  to  7-day 
intervals.  More  frequent  doses  are  usually  used  in  patients  with 
cobalamin neuropathy, but there is no evidence that they produce a 
better response. Allergic reactions are rare and may require desensi-
tization or antihistamine or glucocorticoid cover. For maintenance 
therapy,  1000  μg  hydroxocobalamin  IM  once  every  3  months  is 
satisfactory.  Because  of  the  poorer  retention  of  cyanocobalamin, 
protocols generally use higher and more frequent doses, for exam-
ple, 1000 μg IM, monthly, for maintenance treatment.

Because a small fraction of cobalamin can be absorbed passively 
through  mucous  membranes  even  when  there  is  complete  failure 
of  physiologic  IF-dependent  absorption,  large  daily  oral  doses 
(1000–2000 μg) of cyanocobalamin are used in PA for replacement 
(especially  in  Canada  and  Sweden)  and  maintenance  of  normal 
cobalamin status in, for example, food malabsorption of cobalamin. 
Sublingual therapy has also been proposed for those in whom injec-
tions are difficult because of a bleeding tendency and who may not 
tolerate oral therapy. If oral therapy is used, it is important to mon-
itor  compliance,  particularly  with  elderly,  forgetful  patients.  This 
author prefers parenteral therapy for initial treatment, particularly 
in severe anemia or if a neuropathy is present, and for maintenance 
in PA. Oral B12 therapy even with low doses of 50 μg daily may have 
a larger role in treating food malabsorption of B12.

For treatment of patients with subnormal serum vitamin B12 levels 
with  a  normal  MCV  and  no  hypersegmentation  of  neutrophils,  a 
negative  IF  antibody  test  in  the  absence  of  tests  of  B12  absorption  is 
problematic.  Some  (perhaps  15%)  cases  may  be  due  to  TC  I  (HC) 
deficiency. Homocysteine and/or MMA measurements may help, but 
in  the  absence  of  these  tests  and  with  otherwise  normal  gastroin-
testinal  function,  repeat  serum  B12  assay  after  6–12  months  may   
help one decide whether to start cobalamin therapy.

Vitamin B12 injections are used in a wide variety of diseases, often 
neurologic, despite normal serum B12 and folate levels and a nor-
mal blood count and in the absence of randomized, double-blind, 
controlled  trials.  These  conditions  include  multiple  sclerosis  and 
chronic  fatigue  syndrome/myalgic  encephalomyelitis  (ME).  It 
seems  probable  that  any  benefit  is  due  to  the  placebo  effect  of  a 
usually  painless,  pink  injection.  In  ME,  oral  B12  therapy,  despite 
providing equally large amounts of B12, has not been beneficial, sup-
porting the view of the effect of the injections being placebo only. 

FOLATE DEFICIENCY
Oral doses of 5–15 mg of folic acid daily are satisfactory, as suffi-
cient  folate  is  absorbed  from  these  extremely  large  doses  even  in 
patients  with  severe  malabsorption.  The  length  of  time  therapy 
must  be  continued  depends  on  the  underlying  disease.  It  is  cus-
tomary  to  continue  therapy  for  about  4  months,  when  all  folate- 
deficient red cells will have been eliminated and replaced by new 
folate-replete populations.

Before large doses of folic acid are given, cobalamin deficiency 
must  be  excluded  and,  if  present,  corrected;  otherwise,  cobala-
min neuropathy may develop despite a response of the anemia of 
cobalamin deficiency to folate therapy. Studies in the United States, 
however, suggest that there is no increase in the proportion of indi-
viduals with low serum cobalamin levels and no anemia since food 
fortification with folic acid, but it is unknown if there has been a 
change in incidence of cobalamin neuropathy.

Long-term  folic  acid  therapy  is  required  when  the  underlying 
cause  of  the  deficiency  cannot  be  corrected  and  the  deficiency  is 
likely  to  recur,  for  example,  in  chronic  dialysis  or  hemolytic  ane-
mias. It may also be necessary in gluten-induced enteropathy that 
does  not  respond  to  a  gluten-free  diet.  Where  mild  but  chronic 
folate deficiency occurs, it is preferable to encourage improvement 

in  the  diet  after  correcting  the  deficiency  with  a  short  course  of 
folic acid. In any patient receiving long-term folic acid therapy, it 
is important to measure the serum cobalamin level at regular (e.g., 
once-yearly)  intervals  to  exclude  the  coincidental  development  of 
cobalamin deficiency. 

775

Folinic Acid (5-Formyl-THF)  This is a stable form of fully reduced 
folate. It is given orally or parenterally to overcome the toxic effects 
of  methotrexate  or  other  DHF  reductase  inhibitors,  for  example, 
trimethoprim or cotrimoxazole. 

PROPHYLACTIC FOLIC ACID
Prophylactic  folic  acid  is  used  in  chronic  dialysis  patients  and  in 
parenteral  feeds.  Prophylactic  folic  acid  has  been  used  to  reduce 
homocysteine levels to prevent cardiovascular disease and for cog-
nitive  function  in  the  elderly,  but  there  are  no  firm  data  to  show 
any benefit. 

Pregnancy 
In over 70 countries (but none in Europe), food is for-
tified with folic acid (in grain or flour) to reduce the risk of NTDs. 
Nevertheless, folic acid, 400 μg daily, should be given as a supplement 
before and throughout pregnancy to prevent megaloblastic anemia 
and reduce the incidence of NTDs, even in countries with fortifi-
cation of the diet. The levels of fortification provide up to 400 μg  
daily  on  average  in  Chile,  but  in  most  countries,  it  is  nearer  to   
200 μg, so periconceptual folic acid is still needed. Most if not all 
the folic acid used in fortification and eaten over three meals a day 
will be converted during absorption to methyltetrahydrofolate. This 
compound will not correct the anemia in B12 deficiency. Studies in 
early pregnancy show significant lack of compliance with the folic 
acid  supplements,  emphasizing  the  benefit  of  food  fortification. 
Supplemental  folic  acid  reduces  the  incidence  of  birth  defects  in 
babies  born  to  diabetic  mothers.  In  women  who  have  had  a  pre-
vious  fetus  with  an  NTD,  a  dose  of  5  mg  daily  is  recommended 
when  pregnancy  is  contemplated  and  throughout  the  subsequent 
pregnancy. 
Infancy  and  Childhood  The  incidence  of  folate  deficiency  is  so 
high  in  the  smallest  premature  babies  during  the  first  6  weeks  of 
life  that  folic  acid  (e.g.,  1  mg  daily)  should  be  given  routinely  to 
those  weighing  <1500  g  at  birth  and  to  larger  premature  babies 
who require exchange transfusions or develop feeding difficulties, 
infections, or vomiting and diarrhea.

The World Health Organization currently recommends routine 
supplementation  with  iron  and  folic  acid  in  children  in  countries 
where iron deficiency is common and child mortality, largely due 
to infectious diseases, is high. However, some studies suggest that in 
areas where malaria rates are high, this approach may increase the 
incidence  of  severe  illness  and  death.  Even  where  malaria  is  rare, 
there appears to be no survival benefit.

MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA NOT DUE TO 
COBALAMIN OR FOLATE DEFICIENCY OR 
ALTERED METABOLISM
This  may  occur  with  many  antimetabolic  drugs  (e.g.,  hydroxyurea, 
cytosine arabinoside, 6-mercaptopurine) that inhibit DNA replication. 
Antiviral  nucleoside  analogues  used  in  treatment  of  HIV  infection 
may  also  cause  macrocytosis  and  megaloblastic  marrow  changes.  In 
the  rare  disease  orotic  aciduria,  two  consecutive  enzymes  in  purine 
synthesis  are  defective.  The  condition  responds  to  therapy  with  uri-
dine, which bypasses the block. In thiamine-responsive megaloblastic 
anemia, there is a genetic defect in the high-affinity thiamine transport 
(SLC19A2) gene. This causes defective RNA ribose synthesis through 
impaired activity of transketolase, a thiamine-dependent enzyme in the 
pentose  cycle.  This  leads  to  reduced  nucleic  acid  production.  It  may 
be associated with diabetes mellitus and deafness and the presence of 
many  ringed  sideroblasts  in  the  marrow.  The  explanation  is  unclear 
for megaloblastic changes in the marrow in some patients with acute 
myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia.

100 Hemolytic Anemias

Lucio Luzzatto, Lucia De Franceschi

 ■ DEFINITIONS
A finite life span is a distinct characteristic of red cells. Hence, a logical, 
time-honored classification of anemias is in three groups: (1) decreased 
production of red cells, (2) increased destruction of red cells, and (3) 
acute  blood  loss.  Decreased  production  is  covered  in  Chaps.  97,  98, 
and 102; acute blood loss in Chap. 101; increased destruction is cov-
ered in this chapter.

All patients who are anemic as a result of either increased destruc-
tion  of  red  cells  or  acute  blood  loss  have  one  important  element  in 
common: the anemia results from overconsumption of red cells from 
the peripheral blood, whereas the supply of cells from the bone mar-
row  is  normal  (indeed,  it  is  usually  increased).  However,  with  blood 
loss, as in acute hemorrhage, the red cells are physically lost from the 
body itself; this is fundamentally different from destruction of red cells 
within the body, as in hemolytic anemias (HAs).

With respect to primary etiology, HAs may be inherited or acquired; 
from a clinical point of view, they may be more acute or more chronic, 
and they may vary from mild to very severe; the site of hemolysis may 
be predominantly intravascular or extravascular. With respect to mech-
anisms, HAs may be due to intracorpuscular causes or to extracorpus-
cular causes (Table 100-1). But before reviewing the individual types

aHereditary causes correlate with intracorpuscular defects because these defects 
are due to inherited mutations; the one exception is PNH because the defect is 
due to an acquired somatic mutation. Conversely, acquired causes correlate with 
extracorpuscular factors because mostly these factors are exogenous; the one 
exception is familial hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS; often referred to as atypical 
HUS) because here an inherited abnormality permits complement activation 
triggered by exogenous factors, to become excessive, with bouts of production of 
membrane attack complex capable of destroying normal red cells. Interestingly, in 
both PNH and aHUS hemolysis is complement-mediated.

of HA, it is appropriate to consider what general features they have in 
common, in terms of clinical aspects and pathophysiology.
 ■ GENERAL CLINICAL AND LABORATORY 
FEATURES
The clinical presentation of a patient with anemia is greatly influenced 
in the first place by whether the onset is abrupt or gradual and HAs are 
no exception. A patient with autoimmune HA or with favism may be 
a medical emergency, whereas a patient with mild hereditary sphero-
cytosis (HS) or with cold agglutinin disease (CAD) may be diagnosed 
after  years.  This  is  due  in  large  measure  to  the  remarkable  ability  of 
the body to adapt to anemia when it is slowly progressing (Chap. 63).
What differentiates HAs from other anemias is that the patient has 
signs  and  symptoms  arising  directly  from  hemolysis  (Table  100-2). 
At the clinical level, the main sign is jaundice; in addition, the patient 
may report discoloration of the urine. In many cases of HA, the spleen 
is enlarged because it is a preferential site of hemolysis; and in some 
cases, the liver may be enlarged as well. In all severe congenital forms of 
HA, there may also be skeletal changes due to overactivity of the bone 
marrow: they are never as severe as in thalassemia major because there 
is less ineffective erythropoiesis, or none at all.

The  laboratory  features  of  HA  are  related  to  (i)  hemolysis  per  se, 
and  (ii)  the  erythropoietic  response  of  the  bone  marrow.  In  most 
cases  hemolysis  is  largely  extravascular,  and  it  produces  an  increase 
in  unconjugated  bilirubin  and  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  in 
the serum; urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. If 
hemolysis  is  mainly  intravascular,  the  telltale  sign  is  hemoglobinuria 
(often  associated  with  hemosiderinuria);  in  the  serum  there  is  free 
hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased, and haptoglo-
bin  is  reduced.  In  contrast,  the  serum  bilirubin  level  may  be  normal

or only mildly elevated. The main sign of the erythropoietic response 
by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes (a test all too often 
neglected in the initial workup of a patient with anemia). Usually the 
increase will be reflected in both the percentage of reticulocytes (the 
more commonly quoted figure) and in the absolute reticulocyte count 
(the more definitive parameter). The increased number of reticulocytes 
is  associated  with  an  increased  mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV)  in 
the blood count. On the blood smear, this is reflected in the presence 
of  macrocytes;  there  is  also  polychromasia,  and  sometimes  one  sees 
nucleated red cells. In most cases, a bone marrow aspirate is not nec-
essary  in  the  diagnostic  workup;  if  it  is  done,  it  will  show  erythroid 
hyperplasia.  In  practice,  once  an  HA  is  suspected,  specific  tests  will 
usually be required for a definitive diagnosis of a specific type of HA.

 ■ GENERAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The  mature  red  cell  is  the  product  of  a  developmental  pathway  that 
brings  the  phenomenon  of  differentiation  to  an  extreme.  An  orderly 
sequence of events produces synchronous changes, whereby the grad-
ual  accumulation  of  a  huge  amount  of  hemoglobin  in  the  cytoplasm 
(to a final level of 340 g/L, i.e., about 5 mM) goes hand in hand with 
the gradual loss of cellular organelles and of biosynthetic abilities. In 
the  end,  the  erythroid  cell  undergoes  a  process  that  has  features  of 
apoptosis, including nuclear pyknosis and eventually extrusion of the 
nucleus. However, the final result is more altruistic than suicidal; the 
cytoplasmic  body,  instead  of  disintegrating,  is  now  able  to  provide  
oxygen to all cells in the human organism for some remaining 120 days 
of the red cell life span.

As a result of this unique process of differentiation and maturation, 
intermediary  metabolism  is  drastically  curtailed  in  mature  red  cells 
(Fig. 100-1); for instance, cytochrome-mediated oxidative phosphory-
lation has been lost with the loss of mitochondria (through a process of 
physiologic autophagy); therefore, there is no backup to anaerobic gly-
colysis, which in the red cell is the only provider of adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP). Also, the capacity of making protein has been lost with 
the loss of ribosomes. This places the cell’s limited metabolic apparatus 
at  risk,  because  if  any  protein  component  deteriorates,  it  cannot  be 
replaced, as it would be in most other cells; and in fact, the activity of 
most enzymes gradually decreases as red cells age. At the same time, 
during their long time in circulation, various red cell components inev-
itably  accumulate  damage  and  become  physically  denser.  The  anion 
exchanger known as band 3 is the most abundant protein in the red cell 
membrane (Fig. 100-2 and Table 100-3), with about 1.2 million mol-
ecules per red cell. As red cells age and become denser, probability is 
increased that a region of the band 3 molecule becomes exposed on the 
cell surface and contributes to creating an antigenic site recognizable by 
low-avidity naturally occurring anti-band 3 IgG antibodies. This pro-
cess might be enhanced by the clustering of band 3 molecules favored 
by the antibody itself and by the binding of hemichromes arising from 
hemoglobin degradation. Senescent red cells thus become opsonized, 
and this is the signal for phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen, 
in  the  liver,  and  elsewhere.  This  process  may  become  accelerated  in 
various ways in HA.

Another  consequence  of  the  relative  simplicity  of  red  cells  is  that 
they have a limited range of ways to manifest distress under hardship; 
in essence, any sort of metabolic failure will eventually lead either to 
structural damage to the membrane or to failure of the cation pump. 
In either case, the life span of the red cell is reduced, which is the defi-
nition of a hemolytic disorder. If the rate of red cell destruction exceeds 
the capacity of the bone marrow to produce more red cells, the hemo-
lytic disorder will manifest as HA.

Thus, the essential pathophysiologic process common to all HAs is 
an increased red cell turnover; in many HAs, this is due at least in part 
to an acceleration of the senescence process described above. The gold 
standard for proving that the life span of red cells is reduced (compared 
to the normal value of about 120 days) is a red cell survival study, which 
can be carried out by labeling the red cells with 51Cr and measuring the 
fall in radioactivity over several days or weeks (this classic test can now 
be replaced by a methodology using the nonradioactive isotope 15N). If 
the hemolytic event is transient, it does not usually cause any long-term

FIGURE 100-1  Red blood cell (RBC) metabolism. The Embden-Meyerhof pathway 
(glycolysis)  generates  ATP  required  for  cation  transport  and  for  membrane 
maintenance.  The  generation  of  NADH  maintains  hemoglobin  iron  in  a  reduced 
state.  The  hexose  monophosphate  shunt  generates  NADPH  that  is  used  to 
reduce  glutathione,  which  protects  the  red  cell  against  oxidant  stress;  the 
6-phosphogluconate, after decarboxylation, can be recycled via pentose sugars to 
glycolysis. Regulation of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate level is a critical determinant 
of oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Enzyme deficiency states in order of prevalence:

consequences, except for an increased requirement for erythropoietic 
factors,  particularly  folic  acid.  However,  if  hemolysis  is  recurrent  or 
persistent, the increased bilirubin production favors the formation of 
gallstones. If a considerable proportion of hemolysis takes place in the 
spleen, as is often the case, splenomegaly may become increasingly a 
feature, and hypersplenism may develop, with consequent neutropenia 
and/or thrombocytopenia.

The increased red cell turnover has important consequences. In nor-
mal subjects, the iron from effete red cells is very efficiently recycled by 
the body; however, with chronic intravascular hemolysis, the persistent 
hemoglobinuria will cause considerable iron loss, needing replacement. 
With chronic extravascular hemolysis, the opposite problem, iron over-
load, is more common, especially if the patient needs frequent blood 
transfusions. Even without blood transfusion, when erythropoiesis is 
massively increased, the release of erythroferrone from erythroid cells 
suppresses  hepcidin,  causing  increased  iron  absorption.  In  the  long 
run, in the absence of iron-chelation therapy, iron overload will cause 
secondary hemochromatosis; this will cause damage particularly to the 
liver, eventually leading to cirrhosis; and to the heart muscle, eventually 
causing heart failure.

Compensated Hemolysis versus Hemolytic Anemia  Red cell 
destruction is a potent stimulus for erythropoiesis, which is mediated

by erythropoietin (EPO) produced by the kidney. This mechanism is so 
effective that in many cases the increased output of red cells from the 
bone marrow can fully balance an increased destruction of red cells. In 
such cases, we say that hemolysis is compensated. The pathophysiology 
of  compensated  hemolysis  is  similar  to  what  we  have  just  described, 
except there is no anemia. This notion is important from the diagnostic 
point  of  view,  because  a  patient  with  a  hemolytic  condition,  even  an 
inherited  one,  may  present  without  anemia;  and  it  is  also  important 
from  the  point  of  view  of  management  because  compensated  hemo-
lysis may become “decompensated,” i.e., anemia may suddenly appear 
in certain circumstances, for instance in pregnancy, folate deficiency, 
or  renal  failure  interfering  with  adequate  EPO  production.  Another 
general  feature  of  chronic  HAs  is  seen  when  any  intercurrent  condi-
tion,  such  as  an  acute  infection,  depresses  erythropoiesis.  When  this 
happens, in view of the increased rate of red cell turnover, the effect 
will be predictably much more marked than in a person who does not 
have hemolysis. The most dramatic example is infection by parvovirus 
B19,  which  may  cause  a  rather  precipitous  fall  in  hemoglobin—an 
occurrence sometimes referred to as aplastic crisis.

 ■ INHERITED HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS
The red cell has three essential components: (1) hemoglobin, (2) the 
membrane-cytoskeleton  complex,  and  (3)  the  metabolic  machinery 
necessary to keep hemoglobin and the membrane-cytoskeleton com-
plex in working order. Diseases caused by inherited abnormalities of 
hemoglobin, or hemoglobinopathies, are covered in Chap. 98. Here we 
will deal with diseases of the other two components.

Hemolytic Anemias due to Abnormalities of the Membrane-
Cytoskeleton Complex  The  detailed  architecture  of  the  red  cell 
membrane is complex, but its basic design is relatively simple (Fig. 100-2).  
The  lipid  bilayer  incorporates  phospholipids  and  cholesterol,  and 
it  is  spanned  by  a  number  of  proteins  that  have  their  hydrophobic 
transmembrane domain(s) embedded in the membrane; most of these

proteins  also  extend  to  both  the  outside  (extracellular  domains)  and 
the inside of the cell (cytoplasmic domains). Other proteins are teth-
ered  to  the  membrane  through  a  glycosylphosphatidylinositol  (GPI) 
anchor; these have only an extracellular domain. Membrane proteins 
include  energy-dependent  ion  transporters,  ion  channels,  receptors 
for complement components, and receptors for other ligands. The most 
abundant  red  cell  membrane  proteins  are  glycophorins  and  the  so-
called band 3, an anion transporter that is an integral membrane pro-
tein. The extracellular domains of many of these proteins are heavily 
glycosylated,  and  they  carry  antigenic  determinants  that  correspond 
to  blood  groups.  Underneath  the  membrane,  and  tangential  to  it,  is 
a network of other proteins that make up the cytoskeleton. The main 
cytoskeletal  protein  is  the  spectrin  tetramer,  consisting  of  a  head-
to-head  association  of  two  α-spectrin-β-spectrin  heterodimers.  The 
cytoskeleton is linked to the membrane through the ankyrin complex 
(that includes also band 4.2) and the junctional complex (that includes 
adducin  and  band  4.1)  (Fig.  100-2).  These  multiprotein  complexes 
make membrane and cytoskeleton intimately connected to each other, 
thus supporting membrane stability and at the same time providing the 
erythrocyte with the important property of deformability.

The  membrane-cytoskeleton  complex  has  essentially  three  func-
tions:  It  is  an  envelope  for  the  red  cell  cytoplasm;  it  maintains  the 
normal red cell shape; it provides cross-membrane transport of elec-
trolytes  and  of  metabolites  such  as  glucose  and  amino  acids.  In  the 
membrane-cytoskeleton  complex,  the  individual  components  are  so 
intimately  associated  with  each  other  that  an  abnormality  of  almost 
any  of  them  will  be  disturbing  or  disruptive,  causing  mechanical 
instability  of  the  membrane  and/or  reduced  red  cell  deformability, 
ultimately  causing  hemolysis.  These  abnormalities  are  almost  invari-
ably inherited mutations; thus diseases of the membrane-cytoskeleton 
complex belong to the category of inherited HAs. Before the red cells 
lyse,  they  often  exhibit  more  or  less  specific  changes  that  alter  the 
normal biconcave disk shape. Thus, the majority of the diseases in this 
group  have  been  known  for  over  a  century  as  hereditary  spherocy-
tosis  (HS)  and  hereditary  elliptocytosis 
(HE). More recently a third morphologic 
entity,  whereby  on  a  blood  smear  the 
round-shaped central pallor of a red cell 
is replaced by a linear-shaped central pale 
area, has earned the name stomatocytosis: 
because this abnormal shape is related to 
abnormalities  of  channel  molecules,  the 
underlying  disorders  are  also  referred 
to  as  channelopathies.  From  an  under-
standing  of  the  molecular  basis  of  these 
disorders,  it  has  emerged  (Table  100-3) 
that,  although  these  disorders  are  pre-
dominantly  monogenic,  no  one-to-one 
correlation exists between a certain gene 
and  a  certain  disorder.  Rather,  what  has 
been  regarded  as  a  single  disorder  (e.g., 
HS) can arise through mutation of one of 
several genes; conversely, what have been 
regarded as different disorders can arise 
through  different  mutations  of  the  very 
same gene (Fig. 100-3).

FIGURE 100-2  The red cell membrane and cytoskeleton. Within the membrane lipid bilayer several integral membrane 
proteins are shown: band 3 (anion exchanger 1 [AE1]) is the most abundant. PIEZO1 is a mechanoreceptor, KCNN4, a 
Ca2+ activated K+ channel, and ABCB6 is an ion channel: they are important in the regulation of the red cell volume. 
Other  proteins,  e.g.,  acetylcholinesterase  (AChE)  and  the  two  complement-regulatory  proteins  CD59  and  CD55,  are 
tethered to the membrane through the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor: in these cases the entire polypeptide 
chain  is  extracellular.  Many  of  the  membrane  proteins  bear  polypeptide  and/or  carbohydrate  red  cell  antigens. 
Underneath the membrane, the α−β spectrin dimers, that associate head-to-head into tetramers, together with actin 
and other proteins, form most of the cytoskeleton. The ankyrin complex, that also involves the band 4.2 protein, and 
the junctional complex, that involves the band 4.1 protein and dematin, connect the membrane to the cytoskeleton. 
The ankyrin complex provides mainly radial (also called vertical) connections; the junctional complex provides mainly 
tangential (also called horizontal) connections: pathogenic changes in the former can cause spherocytosis, whereas 
pathogenic changes in the latter can cause elliptocytosis; pathogenic changes in spectrin can cause either. Branched 
lines symbolize carbohydrate moiety of proteins. The various molecules are obviously not drawn to the same scale.

is  most  common  among  this  group  of 
HAs,  with  an  estimated  prevalence  of 
1:2000–1:5000 in populations of European

Minkowksy  and  Chauffard,  who,  at  the 
end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  reported 
families  who  had  spherocytes  in  their 
peripheral blood (Fig. 100-4A). In vitro 
studies  revealed  that  the  red  cells  were 
abnormally  susceptible  to  lysis  in  hypo-
tonic  media;  indeed,  the  presence  of

COMMENTS
Rare
Mutations of this gene account for about 65% of HE. More severe forms 
may be due to coexistence of an otherwise silent mutant allele.
Rare
Mutations of this gene account for about 30% of HE, including some 
severe forms.
May account for majority of HS.
Mutations of this gene may account for about 25% of HS.
Polymorphic mutation (deletion of nine amino acids); in heterozygotes 
clinically asymptomatic and protective against Plasmodium falciparum.
Certain specific missense mutations shift protein function from anion 
exchanger to cation conductance.
Mutations of this gene account for about 5% of HE, mostly with prominent 
morphology but little/no hemolysis in heterozygotes; severe hemolysis in 
homozygotes.
Mutations of this gene account for about 3% of HS.
Very rare; associated with total loss of all Rh antigens.
One specific mutation in this gene entails loss of stomatin from the cell 
membrane, causing overhydrated stomatocytosis.
Also known as xerocytosis with pseudohyperkalemia. Patients may 
present with perinatal edema.

Clinical presentation similar to that of PIEZO1 mutants.

Increased potassium leakage upon storage in blood bank condition: this 
can cause hyperkalemia in the recipient. ABCB6 mutation is present in 
0.3% of blood donors.
Associated with serious neurological manifestations.

Note: PIEZO1, KCNN4, ABCB6, and GLUT1 are channel molecules; conditions associated with mutations in the respective genes are appropriately named channelopathies.

osmotic  fragility  became  the  main  diagnostic  test  for  HS.  Today  we 
know  that  HS,  thus  defined,  is  genetically  heterogeneous;  i.e.,  it  can 
arise from a variety of mutations in one of several genes (Table 100-3). 
It  has  been  also  recognized  that  the  inheritance  of  HS  is  not  always 
autosomal  dominant  (with  the  patient  being  heterozygous);  indeed, 
some of the most severe forms are instead autosomal recessive (with 
the patient being homozygous).
Clinical  Presentation  and  Diagnosis  The  spectrum  of  clinical  severity  of 
HS is broad. Severe cases may present in infancy with severe anemia, 
whereas mild cases may present in young adults or even later in life. 
The main clinical findings are jaundice, an enlarged spleen, and often 
gallstones; indeed, it may be the finding of gallstones in a young person 
that triggers diagnostic investigations.

The  variability  in  clinical  manifestations  that  is  observed  among 
patients with HS is largely due to the different underlying molecular 
lesions (Table 100-3). Not only are mutations of several genes involved, 
even different mutations of the same gene can give very different clin-
ical  manifestations.  In  milder  cases,  hemolysis  is  often  compensated 
(see above), but changes in clinical expression may be seen even in the 
same  patient  because  intercurrent  conditions  (e.g.,  pregnancy,  infec-
tion)  may  cause  decompensation.  The  anemia  is  usually  normocytic 
with the characteristic morphology that gives the disease its name. An 
increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC >34) 
and increased red cell distribution width (RDW >14%) associated with 
normal or slightly decreased MCV on an ordinary blood count report 
should  raise  the  suspicion  of  HS.  The  spleen  plays  a  key  role  in  HS 

through a dual mechanism. On one hand, like in many other HAs, the 
spleen itself is a major site of destruction; on the other hand, because 
the  red  cells  in  HS  are  less  deformable,  transit  through  the  splenic 
circulation  makes  them  more  prone  to  vesiculate,  thus  accelerating 
their demise.

When there is a family history, it is usually easy to make a diagnosis 
based  on  features  of  HA  and  typical  red  cell  morphology.  However, 
family  history  may  be  negative  for  at  least  two  reasons.  First,  the 
patient may have a de novo mutation, i.e., a mutation that has taken 
place in a germ cell of one of the patient’s parents or early after zygote 
formation.  Second,  the  patient  may  have  a  recessive  form  of  HS  
(Table 100-3). In such cases, more extensive laboratory investigations 
are required, including osmotic fragility, the acid glycerol lysis test, the 
eosin-5’-maleimide (EMA)–binding test, and SDS-gel electrophoresis 
of membrane proteins; these tests are usually carried out in laboratories 
with special expertise in this area. Sometimes a definitive diagnosis can 
be obtained only by molecular studies demonstrating a mutation in one 
of the genes underlying HS (Table 100-3).

We do not have a causal treatment for HS; i.e., no way has yet been 
found  to  correct  the  basic  defect  in  the  membrane-cytoskeleton 
structure.  Given  the  special  role  of  the  spleen  in  HS  (see  above),

FIGURE  100-3  Hereditary  spherocytosis  (HS),  hereditary  elliptocytosis  (HE), 
and  hereditary  stomatocytosis  (HSt)  are  three  morphologically  distinct  forms  of 
congenital hemolytic anemia. It has emerged that each one can arise from mutation 
of one of several genes and that different mutations of the same gene can give one 
or another form. (See also Table 100-3.) Genes encoding membrane proteins are in 
black; genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins are in green; genes encoding proteins 
in the junctional and ankyrin complexes are in purple.

splenectomy  is  often  beneficial.  Current  recommendations  are  to 
proceed with splenectomy at the age of 4–6 years in severe cases, 
to delay splenectomy until puberty in moderate cases, and to avoid 
splenectomy in mild cases. Partial splenectomy can be considered 
in  certain  cases;  and  it  is  helpful  to  know  about  the  outcome  of 
splenectomy in the patient’s affected relatives. Before splenectomy, 
vaccination  against  encapsulated  bacteria  (Neisseria  meningitidis 
and Streptococcus pneumonia) is imperative; penicillin prophylaxis 
after splenectomy is controversial. Along with splenectomy, chole-
cystectomy should not be carried out automatically; but it should 
be carried out, usually by the laparoscopic approach, whenever it is 
clinically indicated.

HEREDITARY ELLIPTOCYTOSIS  HE is at least as heterogeneous as HS, 
both from the genetic point of view (Table 100-3, Fig. 100-3) and from 
the clinical point of view. The global incidence of HE is 1:2000–4000 
subjects. Again, it is the shape of the red cells (Fig. 100-4B) that gives 
the name to the condition, but there is no direct correlation between 
the elliptocytic morphology and clinical severity. In fact, some mild or 
even asymptomatic cases may have nearly 100% elliptocytes (or oval-
ocytes).  Indeed,  the  diagnosis  of  HE  is  generally  incidental,  because 
hemolysis may be compensated and there may be no anemia, although 
this  may  become  evident  in  the  course  of  infection.  One  particular 
in-frame deletion of nine amino acids in the SLC4A1 gene encoding 
band  3  underlies  the  so-called  Southeast  Asia  ovalocytosis  (SAO):  it 
is  not  a  disease,  but  rather  a  polymorphism  with  a  frequency  of  up 
to  5–7%  in  certain  populations  (e.g.,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Indonesia, 
Malaysia,  Philippines),  presumably  as  a  result  of  malaria  selection;  it 
is asymptomatic in heterozygotes and probably lethal in homozygotes. 
The  cases  of  HE  with  the  most  severe  HA  are  those  with  biallelic 
mutations  of  one  of  the  genes  involved  (see  Fig.  100-3),  and  these 
are  said  to  have  pyropoikilocytosis  (HPP):  here  the  instability  of  the 
cytoskeleton protein network may result from decreased tetrameriza-
tion of spectrin dimers. The red cell volume is decreased (MCV: 50–60 
fL), and all kinds of bizarre poikilocytes are seen on the blood smear 
(Fig. 100-4C). HPP patients have splenomegaly and often benefit from 
splenectomy.

Channelopathies  These rare conditions (see Fig. 100-3) are char-
acterized by abnormalities in red cell ion content and alteration of ery-
throcyte volume. Cation leak can cause hyperkalemia; in some cases, 
this leak is accelerated in the cold (the resulting spuriously high serum 
K+  is  then  referred  to  as  pseudo-hyperkalemia).  The  less  rare  form,

abnormalities. A. Hereditary spherocytosis. B. Hereditary elliptocytosis, heterozygote.

dehydrated stomatocytosis (DHS; also referred to as xerocytosis) is a 
(usually compensated) macrocytic hemolytic disorder, with increased 
MCHC (generally higher than 36 g/dL) associated with mild jaundice.

pressure (mechanoreceptor), or in KCCN4, encoding the Ca2+ activated 
K+ channel (Gardos channel) have been recognized to cause DHS (see 
Table 100-3).

Another  form  is  overhydrated  stomatocytosis  (OHS):  this  too  is 
macrocytic  (MCV  >110  fL),  but  the  MCHC  is  low  (<30  g/dL).  The 
underlying mutation is in the Rhesus gene RHAG, which encodes an 
ammonia channel. Yet other patients with stomatocytosis (Table 100-3) 
have mutations in SLC4A1 (encoding band 3) and SLC2A1 (encoding 
the glucose transporter GLUT1). Mutations of the latter are responsible 
for cryohydrocytosis, a channelopathy in which the red cells swell and 
burst when they are cooled. In vivo hemolysis can vary from relatively 
mild  to  quite  severe.  Familial  hyperkalemia  has  been  recently  linked 
to mutations in ABCB6, resulting in abnormal cation leak with extra-
cellular release of a large amount of K+ (hyperkaliemia). Mutations in 
ABCB6 have been identified in almost 0.3% of blood donors. However, 
splenectomy is contraindicated in stomatocytosis due to the significant 
proportion of severe thromboembolic complications observed in sple-
nectomized DHS patients.

A  specialized  technique  to  measure  erythrocyte  deformability 
through laser diffraction analysis is ektacytometry: this has been used 
extensively in order to investigate membrane-cytoskeleton abnormali-
ties. For diagnostic purposes, systematic sequencing of a panel of genes 
in patients’ DNA is a powerful approach already in use and destined to 
be used increasingly.

Enzyme Abnormalities  When an important defect in a compo-
nent  of  the  membrane-cytoskeleton  complex  is  present,  hemolysis  is 
a direct consequence of the fact that the very structure of the red cell 
is  compromised.  Instead,  when  one  of  the  enzymes  is  defective,  the 
consequences  will  depend  on  the  precise  role  of  that  enzyme  in  the 
metabolic  machinery  of  the  red  cell.  This  machinery  has  two  main 

functions: (1) to provide energy in the form of ATP, and (2) to prevent 
oxidative  damage  to  hemoglobin  and  to  other  proteins  by  providing 
sufficient reductive potential; the key molecule for this is NADPH.
ABNORMALITIES  OF  THE  GLYCOLYTIC  PATHWAY  Because  red  cells, 
in  the  course  of  their  differentiation,  have  sacrificed  not  only  their 
nucleus  and  their  ribosomes  but  also  their  mitochondria,  they  rely 
exclusively  on  the  anaerobic  portion  of  the  glycolytic  pathway  for 
producing  ATP,  most  of  which  is  required  by  the  red  cell  for  cation 
transport  against  a  concentration  gradient  across  the  membrane.  If 
this fails due to a defect of any of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway  
(Table 100-4), the result will be hemolytic disease.
Pyruvate  Kinase  Deficiency  Abnormalities  of  the  glycolytic  pathway  are 
all  inherited  and  all  rare.  Among  them,  deficiency  of  pyruvate  kinase 
(PK) is the least rare, with an estimated prevalence in most populations 
of  1:10,000.  However,  recently,  a  polymorphic  PK  mutation  (E277K) 
was found in some African populations with heterozygote frequencies 
of 1–7%, suggesting that this may be another malaria-related polymor-
phism. HA secondary to PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease 
(Fig. 100-5).

The  clinical  picture  of  homozygous  (or  biallelic)  PK  deficiency  is 
that of an HA that often presents in the newborn with neonatal jaun-
dice,  requiring  nearly  always  phototherapy  and  frequently  exchange 
transfusion; the jaundice persists, and it is often associated with retic-
ulocytosis. The anemia is of variable severity; sometimes it is so severe 
as to require regular blood transfusion treatment, whereas sometimes 
it is mild, bordering on a nearly compensated hemolytic disorder. As 
a result, the diagnosis may be delayed: in some cases, it is made, for 
instance,  in  a  young  woman  during  her  first  pregnancy,  when  the 
anemia may get worse. The delay in diagnosis may be caused in part 
by the fact that the anemia is often remarkably well tolerated because

FIGURE 100-5  Different phenotypes of heterozygotes for red cell enzymopathies. 
In  a  heterozygote  for  deficiency  of  PK,  encoded  by  an  autosomal  gene  (see  
Table 100-4), the level of enzyme is about one-half of normal in all red cells. Because 
this  level  of  enzyme  is  sufficient,  there  are  no  clinical  consequences,  i.e.,  PK 
deficiency is recessive. In a heterozygote for deficiency of G6PD, encoded by an 
X-linked gene, the situation is quite different: X-chromosome inactivation generates 
red  cell  mosaicism,  whereby  some  red  cells  are  entirely  normal  and  others  are 
G6PD deficient. Therefore, G6PD deficiency is expressed in heterozygotes: it is not 
recessive.

the metabolic block at the last step in glycolysis causes an increase in 
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (or DPG; Fig. 100-1), a major effector of the 
hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve; thus the oxygen delivery to the 
tissues is enhanced, a remarkable compensatory feat.

TREATMENT
Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency

The management of PK deficiency is mainly supportive. In view of 
the marked increase in red cell turnover, oral folic acid supplements 
should  be  given  constantly.  Blood  transfusion  should  be  used  as 
necessary, and iron chelation may be required even in some patients 
who,  though  not  receiving  blood  transfusion,  may  be  develop-
ing  iron  overload  (see  “General  Pathophysiology”  above).  About 
one-half  of  patients  sooner  or  later  undergo  splenectomy,  which 
usually  provides  a  modest  but  significant  increase  in  hemoglo-
bin (paradoxically, often reticulocytes also increase considerably). 
Cholecystectomy may also be required. Some patients with severe 
disease  have  received  bone  marrow  transplantation  (BMT)  from 
an HLA-identical PK-normal sibling. Prenatal diagnosis has been 
carried out in a mother who had already had an affected child. A 
clinical  trial  of  a  small  molecule  that  is  a  specific  PK  ligand  and 
may increase the stability and/or catalytic efficiency of mutant PK 
is  currently  ongoing.  Rescue  of  inherited  PK  deficiency  through 
lentiviral-mediated  human  PK  gene  transfer  has  been  successful 
in  mice.  An  oral  small  molecule  allosteric  activator  of  PK  called 
mitapivat  raised  hemoglobin  levels  in  about  half  of  PK  deficient 
patients in a small phase 2 study.

Other  Glycolytic  Enzyme  Abnormalities  All  of  these  defects  are  rare  to 
very  rare  (Table  100-4),  and  most  of  them  cause  HA  with  varying 
degrees  of  severity.  It  is  not  unusual  for  the  presentation  to  be  in 
the  guise  of  severe  neonatal  jaundice,  which  may  require  exchange 
transfusion;  if  the  anemia  is  less  severe,  it  may  present  later  in  life, 
or  it  may  even  remain  asymptomatic  and  be  detected  incidentally 
when  a  blood  count  is  done  for  unrelated  reasons.  The  spleen  is 
often enlarged. When other systemic manifestations occur, they can 
involve the central nervous system (sometimes entailing severe mental 
retardation,  particularly  in  the  case  of  triose  phosphate  isomerase 
deficiency),  the  neuromuscular  system,  or  both  (see  Table  100-4).  
This is not altogether surprising if we consider that these are house-
keeping  genes,  i.e.,  expressed  in  all  tissues.  The  diagnosis  of  HA 
is  usually  not  difficult,  thanks  to  the  triad  of  normo-macrocytic 
anemia,  reticulocytosis,  and  hyperbilirubinemia.  Enzymopathies 
should  be  considered  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  any  chronic 
Coombs-negative  HA.  Unlike  with  membrane  disorders,  in  most 

cases  of  glycolytic  enzymopathies,  morphologic  abnormalities  are 
conspicuous  by  their  absence.  A  definitive  diagnosis  can  be  made 
only  by  demonstrating  the  deficiency  of  an  individual  enzyme  by 
quantitative  assays;  these  are  carried  out  in  only  a  few  specialized 
laboratories. If a particular molecular abnormality is already known 
in the family, then one could test directly for that defect at the DNA 
level, thus bypassing the need for enzyme assays. Of course the time 
may  be  getting  nearer  when  a  patient  will  present  with  her  or  his 
exome already sequenced, and we will need to concentrate on which 
genes to look up within the file. The principles for the management 
of these conditions are similar as for PK deficiency. In isolated cases 
of glycolytic enzyme abnormalities, BMT has been carried out suc-
cessfully, although unfortunately nonhematologic manifestations, if 
any, are not reversed.
ABNORMALITIES  OF  REDOX  METABOLISM  •  Glucose-6-phosphate 
Dehydrogenase  (G6PD)  Deficiency  G6PD  is  a  housekeeping  enzyme 
critical in the redox metabolism of all aerobic cells (Fig. 100-1). In 
red cells, its role is even more critical because it is the only source 
of NADPH, which directly and via glutathione (GSH) defends these 
cells against oxidative stress (Fig. 100-6). G6PD deficiency-related 
HA  is  a  prime  example  of  an  HA  due  to  interaction  between  an 
intracorpuscular  cause  and  an  extracorpuscular  cause:  indeed,  in 
the  vast  majority  of  cases  hemolysis  is  triggered  by  an  exogenous 
agent.  Although  the  G6PD  activity  is  decreased  in  most  tissues  of 
G6PD-deficient  subjects,  in  other  cells  the  decrease  is  much  less 
pronounced  than  in  red  cells,  and  it  does  not  seem  to  impact  on 
clinical expression.

 ■ GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS

The G6PD gene is X-linked, and this has important implications. 
First,  because  males  have  only  one  G6PD  gene  (i.e.,  they  are 
hemizygous for this gene), they must be either normal or G6PD 
deficient.  By  contrast,  females,  who  have  two  G6PD  genes,  can  be 
either  normal  or  deficient  (homozygous)  or  intermediate  (heterozy-
gous). Second, as a result of the phenomenon of X chromosome inac-
tivation,  heterozygous  females  are  genetic  mosaics  (see  Fig.  100-5), 
with a highly variable ratio of G6PD-normal to G6PD-deficient cells 
and an equally variable degree of clinical expression; some heterozy-
gotes can be just as affected as hemizygous males. The enzymatically 
active form of G6PD is either a dimer or a tetramer of a single protein 
subunit of 514 amino acids. G6PD-deficient subjects have been found 
invariably to have mutations in the coding region of the G6PD gene. 
Almost  all  of  the  230  different  mutations  known  are  single  missense 
point mutations, entailing single amino acid replacements in the G6PD 
protein.  In  most  cases,  these  mutations  cause  G6PD  deficiency  by 
decreasing  the  in  vivo  stability  of  the  protein;  thus  the  physiologic 
decrease in G6PD activity that takes place with red cell aging is greatly 
accelerated. In some cases, an amino acid replacement can also affect 
the catalytic function of the enzyme.

Among  these  mutations,  those  underlying  chronic  nonspherocytic 
hemolytic anemia (CNSHA; see below) are a discrete subset. This much 
more severe clinical phenotype can be ascribed in some cases to adverse 
qualitative  changes  (for  instance,  a  decreased  affinity  for  the  substrate 
glucose-6-phosphate)  or  simply  to  the  fact  that  the  enzyme  deficit  is 
more  extreme  because  of  a  more  severe  instability  of  the  enzyme.  For 
instance, a cluster of mutations map at or near the dimer interface, and 
clearly they compromise severely the formation of the dimer.
Epidemiology  G6PD  deficiency  is  widely  distributed  in  tropical  and 
subtropical  parts  of  the  world  (Africa,  Southern  Europe,  the  Middle 
East, Southeast Asia, and Oceania) (Fig. 100-7) and wherever people 
from  those  areas  have  migrated.  A  conservative  estimate  is  that  at 
least  500  million  people  have  a  G6PD  deficiency  gene.  In  several  of 
these areas, the frequency of a G6PD deficiency gene may be as high 
as 20% or more. It would be quite extraordinary for a trait that causes 
significant  pathology  to  spread  widely  and  reach  high  frequencies 
in  many  populations  without  conferring  some  biologic  advantage. 
Indeed,  G6PD  is  one  of  the  best-characterized  examples  of  genetic 
polymorphisms  in  the  human  species.  Clinical  field  studies  and  in

FIGURE 100-6  The role of G6PD in protecting red cells from oxidative damage. A. In G6PD-normal red cells, G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase—two of the 
enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway—provide ample supply of NADPH, which in turn regenerates GSH when this is oxidized by reactive oxygen species (e.g., 
– (meant here to represent itself and other reactive oxygen species or ROS) is produced by pro-oxidant compounds such as primaquine, or the 
O2
glucosides in fava beans (divicine), or the oxidative burst of neutrophils, these ROS are rapidly neutralized; similarly, when rasburicase administered to degrade uric acid 
produces an equimolar amount of hydrogen peroxide, this is rapidly degraded by the combined action of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and Prx2 (peroxiredoxin-2: all 
three mechanisms are NADPH dependent). B. In G6PD-deficient red cells, where the enzyme activity is reduced, NADPH production is limited, and it may not be sufficient 
to cope with the excess ROS generated by pro-oxidant compounds, and the consequent excess hydrogen peroxide. This diagram also explains why a defect in glutathione 
reductase has very similar consequences to G6PD deficiency.

vitro experiments strongly support the view that G6PD deficiency has 
been selected by Plasmodium falciparum malaria because it confers a 
relative resistance against this highly lethal infection. As in other cases 
of balanced polymorphism, it is heterozygotes, therefore females, who 
are  protected.  Different  G6PD  variants  underlie  G6PD  deficiency 
in  different  parts  of  the  world.  Examples  of  widespread  variants  are 
G6PD Mediterranean on the shores of that sea, in the Middle East, and 
elsewhere;  G6PD  A–  in  Africa,  in  the  Middle  East,  and  in  Southern 
Europe; G6PD Orissa in India; G6PD Viangchan and G6PD Mahidol 
in  Southeast  Asia;  G6PD  Kaiping  and  G6PD  Canton  in  China;  and 
G6PD  Union  worldwide.  The  heterogeneity  of  polymorphic  G6PD 
variants  is  proof  of  their  independent  origin,  further  supporting  the 
notion of selection by a common environmental agent, namely malaria, 
in keeping with the concept of convergent evolution (Fig. 100-7).
Clinical  Manifestations  The  vast  majority  of  people  with  G6PD  defi-
ciency remain clinically asymptomatic throughout their lifetime; how-
ever, all of them have an increased risk of developing neonatal jaundice 
(NNJ) and a risk of developing acute HA (AHA) when challenged by a 
number of oxidative agents. NNJ related to G6PD deficiency is rarely 
present at birth; the peak incidence of clinical onset is between day 2 
and day 3, and in most cases the anemia is not severe. However, NNJ 
can be very severe in some G6PD-deficient babies, especially in associ-
ation with prematurity, infection, and/or environmental factors (such 
as naphthalene-camphor balls, which may be used in babies’ bedding 
and  clothing);  and  the  risk  of  severe  NNJ  is  also  increased  by  the 
coexistence of a monoallelic or biallelic mutation in the uridyl trans-
ferase gene (UGT1A1; the same mutations are associated with Gilbert’s 
syndrome). It is imperative to manage promptly NNJ associated with 
G6PD deficiency, because it can produce kernicterus and permanent 
neurologic damage.

AHA can develop as a result of three types of triggers: (1) fava beans, 
(2) infections, and (3) drugs (Table 100-5). Typically, a hemolytic attack 
starts with malaise, weakness, and abdominal or lumbar pain. Within a 
timeframe of several hours to 2–3 days, the patient develops jaundice 
and  often  dark  urine.  The  onset  can  be  extremely  abrupt,  especially 
with favism in children. The anemia is moderate to extremely severe, 
usually normocytic and normochromic, and due partly to intravascular 
hemolysis;  hence,  it  is  associated  with  hemoglobinemia,  hemoglobi-
nuria,  high  LDH,  and  low  or  absent  plasma  haptoglobin.  The  blood 
film shows anisocytosis, polychromasia, and spherocytes; in addition, 
the most typical feature of G6PD deficiency is the presence of bizarre

poikilocytes,  with  red  cells  that  appear  to  have  unevenly  distributed 
hemoglobin (“hemighosts”) and red cells that appear to have had parts 
of them bitten away (“bite cells” or “blister cells”) (Fig. 100-8). A classi-
cal test, now rarely carried out, is supravital staining with methyl violet, 
which, if done promptly, reveals the presence of Heinz bodies (consist-
ing of precipitates of denatured hemoglobin and hemichromes), which 
are regarded as a signature of oxidative damage to red cells (they are 
also seen with unstable hemoglobins). Since there is also a substantial 
component of extravascular hemolysis, unconjugated bilirubin is high 
and there is often clinical icterus. The most serious threat from AHA 
in adults is the development of acute renal failure (this is exceedingly 
rare in children). Once the threat of acute anemia is over and in the 
absence of comorbidity, full recovery from AHA associated with G6PD 
deficiency is the rule.

It was primaquine (PQ)-induced AHA that led to the discovery of 
G6PD  deficiency,  but  this  drug  has  not  been  very  prominent  subse-
quently because it is not necessary for the treatment of life-threatening 
P. falciparum malaria. Today there is a revival in the use of PQ for two 
reasons. First, it is the only effective agent for eliminating the gameto-
cytes of P. falciparum (thus preventing further transmission): a small 
single dose (0.25 mg/kg) is required, and it is safe for G6PD-deficient 
persons.  Second,  a  14-day  course  of  PQ  is  needed  for  eliminating 
the  hypnozoites  of  Plasmodium  vivax  (thus  preventing  endogenous 
relapse). In countries aiming to eliminate malaria, there may be a call 
for mass administration of PQ; this ought to be associated with G6PD 
testing. At the other end of the historic spectrum, the latest additions to 
the list of potentially hemolytic drugs (Table 100-5) are rasburicase and 
pegloticase; again G6PD testing ought to be made mandatory before 
giving  either  of  these  drugs,  because  fatal  cases  have  been  reported 
upon using one of these drugs, which generate hydrogen peroxide, in 
newborns with kidney injury and in adults with tumor lysis syndrome.
Although  drug-induced  AHA  has  been  prominent  in  the  study  of 
G6PD deficiency, the most common clinical manifestations are in fact 
NNJ  and  favism,  both  of  which  are  of  public  health  importance  in 
many  populations.  Contrary  to  beliefs  that  are  still  widespread,  fava 
bean pollen inhalation does not cause favism, and other beans are safe.
A  very  small  minority  of  subjects  with  G6PD  deficiency  have 
CNSHA of variable severity. The patient is nearly always a male, usu-
ally with a history of NNJ, who may present with anemia, unexplained 
jaundice,  or  gallstones  later  in  life.  The  spleen  may  be  enlarged.  The 
severity  of  anemia  ranges  in  different  patients  from  borderline  to 
transfusion dependent. The anemia is usually normo-macrocytic, with 
reticulocytosis. Bilirubin and LDH are increased. Although hemolysis 
is, by definition, chronic in these patients, they are also vulnerable to 
acute oxidative damage, and therefore the same agents that can cause 
AHA in people with the ordinary type of G6PD deficiency will cause

severe  exacerbations  in  people  with  CNSHA  associated  with  G6PD 
deficiency.  In  some  cases  of  CNSHA,  the  deficiency  of  G6PD  is  so 
severe in granulocytes that it limits their capacity to produce an oxida-
tive burst, with consequent increased susceptibility to some bacterial 
infections.
Laboratory  Diagnosis  The  suspicion  of  G6PD  deficiency  can  be  con-
firmed  by  semiquantitative  methods  often  referred  to  as  screening 
tests, which are suitable for population studies and can correctly clas-
sify male subjects, in the steady state, as G6PD normal or G6PD defi-
cient. However, in clinical practice, a diagnostic test is usually needed 
when the patient has had a hemolytic attack: whereby the oldest, most 
G6PD-deficient  red  cells  have  been  selectively  destroyed,  and  young 
red  cells,  having  higher  G6PD  activity,  are  being  released  into  the 
circulation.  Under  these  conditions,  only  a  quantitative  test  can  give 
a definitive result. In males, this test will identify normal hemizygotes 
and G6PD-deficient hemizygotes; among females, some heterozygotes 
will be missed, but those who are at most risk of hemolysis will be iden-
tified. Of course, G6PD deficiency also can be diagnosed by DNA test-
ing. Currently easy-to-use “point of care” tests for G6PD deficiency are 
becoming available, geared especially to the prospect of mass adminis-
tration of PQ or of the newly introduced derivative tafenoquine.

TREATMENT
G6PD Deficiency

The  AHA  of  G6PD  deficiency  is  largely  preventable  by  avoiding 
exposure  to  triggering  factors  of  previously  screened  subjects.  Of 
course, the practicability and cost-effectiveness of screening depend 
on the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in each individual commu-
nity.  Favism  is  entirely  preventable  in  G6PD-deficient  subjects  by 
not eating fava beans. Drug-induced hemolysis can be prevented by 
testing for G6PD deficiency before prescribing; in many cases one 
can use alternative drugs. When AHA develops and once its cause is 
recognized, no specific treatment is needed in most cases. However, 
if the anemia is severe, it may be a medical emergency, especially in 
children, requiring immediate action, including blood transfusion. 
This  has  been  the  case  with  an  antimalarial  drug  combination 
containing  dapsone  (called  Lapdap,  introduced  in  2003)  that  has 
caused  severe  acute  hemolytic  episodes  in  children  with  malaria 
in several African countries; after a few years, the drug was taken 
off the market. If there is acute renal failure, hemodialysis may be 
necessary, but if there is no previous kidney disease, recovery is the 
rule. The management of NNJ associated with G6PD deficiency is 
no different from that of NNJ due to other causes.

In cases with CNSHA, if the anemia is not severe, regular folic 
acid supplements and regular hematologic surveillance will suffice. 
It  will  be  important  to  avoid  exposure  to  potentially  hemolytic 
drugs, and blood transfusion may be indicated when exacerbations 
occur, mostly in concomitance with intercurrent infection. In rare 
patients, regular blood transfusions may be required, in which case 
appropriate iron chelation should be instituted. Unlike in HS, there 
is no evidence of selective red cell destruction in the spleen; how-
ever, in practice, splenectomy has proven beneficial in severe cases.

Other  Abnormalities  of  the  Redox  System  As  mentioned  previously,  GSH 
is a key player in the defense against oxidative stress. Inherited defects 
of  GSH  metabolism  are  exceedingly  rare,  but  each  one  can  give  rise 
to chronic HA (Table 100-4). A rare, peculiar, and severe but usually 
self-limited  HA  occurring  in  the  first  month  of  life,  called  infantile 
poikilocytosis, may be associated with deficiency of glutathione perox-
idase (GSHPX) due not to an inherited abnormality, but to transient 
nutritional deficiency of selenium, an element essential for the activity 
of GSHPX.
PYRIMIDINE  5’-NUCLEOTIDASE  (P5N)  DEFICIENCY  P5N  is  a  key 
enzyme in the catabolism of nucleotides arising from the degradation 
of nucleic acids that takes place in the final stages of erythroid cell mat-
uration. How exactly its deficiency causes HA is not well understood, 

but  a  highly  distinctive  feature  of  this  condition  is  a  morphologic 
abnormality  of  the  red  cells  known  as  basophilic  stippling.  The  con-
dition is rare, but it probably ranks third in frequency among red cell 
enzyme defects (after G6PD deficiency and PK deficiency). The ane-
mia is lifelong, of variable severity, and may benefit from splenectomy.

Familial  (Atypical)  Hemolytic-Uremic  Syndrome  (aHUS)  
This term is used to designate a group of rare disorders, mostly affect-
ing children, characterized by microangiopathic HA with presence of 
fragmented  erythrocytes  in  the  peripheral  blood  smear,  thrombocy-
topenia (usually mild), and acute renal failure. (The word atypical in 
this phrase should be consigned to history: it was introduced originally 
to  distinguish  this  condition  from  the  hemolytic-uremic  syndrome 
[HUS]  caused  by  infection  with  Escherichia  coli  producing  the  Shiga 
toxin, regarded as typical.) The genetic basis of atypical HUS (aHUS) 
has been elucidated. Studies of >100 families have revealed that those 
family  members  who  developed  HUS  had  mutations  in  any  one  of 
several genes encoding complement regulatory proteins: complement 
factor H (CFH), CD46 or membrane cofactor protein (MCP), comple-
ment factor I (CFI), complement component C3, complement factor B 
(CFB), thrombomodulin, and others. Thus, whereas all other inherited 
HAs  are  due  to  intrinsic  red  cell  abnormalities,  this  group  is  unique 
in that hemolysis results from an inherited defect external to red cells 
(Table 100-1). Because the regulation of the complement cascade has 
considerable redundancy, in the steady state any of the above abnor-
malities can be tolerated. However, when an intercurrent infection or 
some other trigger briskly activates complement the deficiency of one 
of  the  complement  regulators  becomes  critical.  Endothelial  cells  get 
damaged,  especially  in  the  kidney;  at  the  same  time,  and  partly  as  a 
result  of  this,  there  will  be  brisk  hemolysis  (thus,  the  more  common 
Shiga  toxin–related  HUS  (Chap.  166)  can  be  regarded  as  a  pheno-
copy  of  aHUS).  aHUS  is  a  severe  disease,  with  up  to  15%  mortality 
in  the  acute  phase  and  up  to  50%  of  cases  progressing  to  end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). Not infrequently, aHUS undergoes spontaneous 
remission. Because it is an inherited abnormality, it is not surprising 
that,  given  renewed  exposure  to  a  trigger,  the  syndrome  will  tend  to 
recur;  when  it  does,  the  prognosis  is  always  serious.  The  traditional 
treatment has been plasma exchange, which will supply the deficient 
complement regulator. This has changed since the introduction of the 
anti-C5 complement inhibitor eculizumab (see “Paroxysmal Nocturnal 
Hemoglobinuria”)  was  found  to  greatly  ameliorate  the  microangio-
pathic picture, with improvement in platelet counts and in renal func-
tion, thus abrogating the need for plasma exchange, which is not always 
effective and not free of complications. Because the basis of aHUS is 
genetic, and relapses are always possible even after complete remission, 
there is a rationale for continuing eculizumab indefinitely, especially in 
order to prevent ESRD. Patients who relapsed after discontinuing ecu-
lizumab have responded again. Discontinuation of eculizumab might 
be reasonable especially in patients heterozygous for a MCP mutation. 
However,  there  is  no  evidence  base  at  the  moment  for  balancing  the 
pros and cons of lifetime eculizumab (a very expensive drug).
 ■ ACQUIRED HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA
Mechanical  Destruction  of  Red  Cells  Although  red  cells  are 
characterized  by  the  remarkable  deformability  that  enables  them  to 
squeeze through capillaries narrower than themselves for thousands of 
times in their lifetime, there are at least two situations in which they 
succumb  to  shear,  if  not  to  wear  and  tear;  the  result  is  intravascular 
hemolysis,  resulting  in  hemoglobinuria  (Table  100-6).  One  situation 
is  acute  and  self-inflicted,  march  hemoglobinuria.  Why  sometimes  a 
marathon runner may develop this complication, whereas on another 
occasion, this does not happen, we do not know (perhaps her or his 
footwear needs attention). A similar syndrome may develop after pro-
longed barefoot ritual dancing or intense playing of bongo drums. The 
other situation is chronic and iatrogenic (it has been called microan-
giopathic hemolytic anemia). It takes place in patients with prosthetic 
heart  valves,  especially  when  paraprosthetic  regurgitation  is  present. 
If  the  hemolysis  consequent  on  mechanical  trauma  to  the  red  cells 
is mild, and if the supply of iron is adequate, the loss may be largely

aThe trigger of acute hemolytic anemia, often with hemoglobinuria, can be infection or a drug (see Table 100-5) rather than fava beans. Hemoglobinuria may or may not be 
reported by patient; but it is often macroscopic, i.e., recognizable by simple inspection of urine.
Abbreviation: G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

compensated;  if  more  than  mild  anemia  develops,  reintervention  to 
correct regurgitation may be required.

Infection  By  far  the  most  frequent  infectious  cause  of  HA  in 
endemic  areas  is  malaria  (Chap.  224).  In  other  parts  of  the  world, 
the  most  frequent  direct  cause  is  probably  Shiga  toxin–producing  E. 
coli  O157:H7,  now  recognized  as  the  main  etiologic  agent  of  HUS, 
which is more common in children than in adults (Chap. 161). Life- 
threatening  intravascular  hemolysis,  due  to  a  toxin  with  lecithinase 
activity, occurs with Clostridium perfringens sepsis, particularly follow-
ing open wounds, septic abortion, or as a disastrous accident due to a 
contaminated blood unit. Rarely, and if at all in children, HA is seen 
with  sepsis  or  endocarditis  from  a  variety  of  organisms.  In  addition, 
bacterial  and  viral  infections  can  cause  HA  by  indirect  mechanisms 
(see Table 100-6).

Immune  Hemolytic  Anemias  These  can  arise  through  at  least 
two  distinct  mechanisms.  First,  when  an  antibody  directed  against  a 
certain molecule (e.g., a drug) reacts with that molecule, red cells may 
get  caught  in  the  reaction  (the  so-called  innocent  bystander  mecha-
nism: see section below on Hemolytic Anemia from Toxic Agents and 
Drugs),  whereby  they  are  damaged  or  destroyed.  Second,  and  more 
frequently, a true autoantibody is directed against a red cell antigen, i.e., 
a molecule present on the surface of red cells. Autoimmune hemolytic 
anemias have been originally classified into two types, depending on 
the  thermal  amplitude  of  the  autoantibodies  involved:  this  classifica-
tion is valid, because the two types have different pathophysiological 
and clinical features.

AUTOIMMUNE  HEMOLYTIC  ANEMIA,  WARM  TYPE  (WAIHA:  FOR  
SIMPLICITY  WE  WILL  USE  THE  ACRONYM  AIHA)  This  type  has  an 
estimated incidence in the United States of about 1–3:100,000 per year, 
and a prevalence of 17:100,000. AIHA can be serious since even with 
appropriate management the mortality is of the order of 5–10%.

Clinical Features and Diagnosis  The onset is often abrupt and can be dra-
matic. The hemoglobin level may drop, within days, to as low as 4 g/dL; 
the massive red cell removal will produce jaundice, and sometimes the 
spleen is enlarged. When this triad is present, the suspicion of AIHA 
must be high. The reticulocyte count is typically elevated, except when 
erythroid precursors are also targeted by the autoantibody attack. LDH 
may also be elevated. In some cases, AIHA can be associated, on first 
presentation  or  subsequently,  with  autoimmune  thrombocytopenia. 
This  double  autoimmune  condition,  referred  to  as  Evans  syndrome, 
may be a manifestation of common variable immune deficiency, and 
in children it may suggest one of several primary immune deficiency 
syndromes. Evans syndrome signals high-risk disease. Other predictors 
of  the  outcome  and  of  the  probability  of  relapse  of  AIHA  are  severe 

anemia  (Hb  <6  g/dL),  certain  characteristics  of  the  antibody,  acute 
renal failure, and infection.

There  are  few  situations  in  hematology  where  one  laboratory  test 
is as informative as the direct antiglobulin test developed in 1945 by 
R. R. A. Coombs and known since then by this name. The currently 
recommended version of this test uses in the first instance a “broad- 
spectrum” reagent, i.e., one that will detect not only immunoglobulins 
(Ig)  but  also  complement  (C)  components  (usually  C3  fragments) 
bound to the surface of the patient’s red cells. If the test is positive (and 
barring  special  circumstances  such  as  previous  blood  transfusion), 
it  is  practically  diagnostic  of  AIHA,  and  one  can  then  determine,  by 
using  specific  reagents,  whether  Ig  or  C  or  both  are  implicated.  The 
sensitivity of the Coombs test varies depending on the techniques that 
are used: in general, the test is positive if there are an average of at least 
400 molecules of Ig and/or C on each red cell; but with more advanced 
techniques involving flow cytometry analysis or enzyme-linked radi-
olabeled tests allowing the detection of ~30–40 antibody molecules per 
erythrocyte, the sensitivity can be pushed to as low as 30–40 molecules 
per red cell. Therefore liaison with a specialized laboratory is desirable; 
a dual direct antiglobulin test has also been developed. In the past the 
diagnosis of “Coombs-negative AIHA” was regarded as a last resort, but 
it is important to know that a patient with this label may have severe 
AIHA,  because  if  the  antibody  is  powerful  (high  affinity/avidity), 
few  molecules  may  be  sufficient  to  opsonize  red  cells.  Based  on  the 
Coombs test findings as well as on the thermal characteristics and the 
antigenic specificities of the autoantibodies (Table 100-7), AIHA has 
been classified into subtypes.

In  AIHA  the  autoantibody  reacts  best  at  37°C  and  it  is  usually 
Rhesus-specific (sometimes specifically anti-e). The main mechanism 
of hemolysis in AIHA is that the Fc portion of the IgG antibody bound 
to red cells is recognized by the Fc receptor of macrophages: this will 
trigger erythrophagocytosis wherever macrophages are abundant, i.e., 
in the liver, in the bone marrow, but especially in red pulp of the spleen 
(see Fig. 100-9) that, also because of its special anatomy, is often the 
predominant site of red cell destruction.

AIHA may be seen in isolation (and it is then called idiopathic) or as 
secondary to other disorders such as systemic autoimmune disorders 
(systemic  lupus  erythematosus  [SLE]:  sometimes  AIHA  may  be  the 
first manifestation that leads to a diagnosis of SLE) or lymphoprolif-
erative  disorders  (Table  100-7).  Like  all  autoimmune  diseases,  AIHA 
must arise from a dysregulation of immunity. It is therefore not sur-
prising that it is increasingly being recognized in chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia  (CLL),  whether  treated  or  untreated;  after  BMT;  and  after 
solid  organ  transplantation  entailing  immunosuppressive  treatment. 
Recently, warm antibody AIHA has also occurred as a side effect of the 
use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, in patients 
with various types of cancer.

TREATMENT
Warm Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia

Severe  acute  AIHA  can  be  a  medical  emergency.  The  immediate 
treatment almost invariably includes transfusion of red cells. This 
may pose a special problem because many or all of the blood units 
cross-matched  may  be  incompatible.  In  these  cases,  it  is  often 
correct, if paradoxical, to transfuse ABO-matched but incompati-
ble blood: the rationale being that the transfused red cells will be 
destroyed no less—but no more—than the patient’s own red cells, 
and  in  the  meantime  the  patient  stays  alive.  A  situation  like  this 
requires close liaison and understanding between the clinical unit 
treating the patient and the blood transfusion/serology lab. When-
ever  the  anemia  is  not  immediately  life-threatening,  blood  trans-
fusion  should  be  withheld  (because  compatibility  problems  may 
increase with each unit of blood transfused), and medical treatment 
started immediately with prednisone (1 mg/kg per day), which will 
produce a remission promptly in at least one-half of patients. Rit-
uximab (anti-CD20), previously regarded as second-line treatment, 
is increasingly being used at a relatively low dose (100 mg/week × 4), 
together with prednisone as part of first-line treatment. It is espe-
cially  encouraging  that  this  approach  seems  to  reduce  the  rate  of 
relapse, a common occurrence in AIHA.

For  patients  who  do  relapse  or  are  refractory  to  medical  treat-
ment,  additional  therapeutic  strategies  are  now  available.  Sple-
nectomy does not cure the disease, but it can produce significant 
benefit  by  removing  a  major  site  of  hemolysis,  thus  improving 
the  anemia  and/or  reducing  the  need  for  other  therapies  (e.g., 
the  dose  of  prednisone);  of  course,  splenectomy  is  not  free  of 
risk,  as  it  entails  increased  risk  of  sepsis  and  of  thrombosis.  The 
response rate to splenectomy and to rituximab are similar. Since the 
introduction of rituximab, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclo-
sporine,  mycophenolate  and  intravenous  immunoglobulin  have 
become second- or third-line agents. In very rare severe refractory 
cases, one may have to consider a high dose of cyclophosphamide  
(50  mg/kg/d  for  4  days)  followed  by  a  myelo-stimulating  agent 
to  support  bone  marrow  or  the  anti-CD52  agent,  alemtuzumab. 
When severe anemia is associated with reticulocytopenia, the use 
of erythropoietin may help to reduce or avoid the requirement for 
transfusion of red cells.

PAROXYSMAL  COLD  HEMOGLOBINURIA  (PCH)  PCH  is  a  rare  form 
of  AIHA  occurring  mostly  in  children,  usually  triggered  by  a  viral 
infection,  usually  self-limited,  and  characterized  by  the  so-called 
Donath-Landsteiner antibody. In vitro, this antibody has unique sero-
logic features; it has usually anti-P specificity and it binds to red cells 
only at a low temperature (optimally at 4°C), but when the tempera-
ture is shifted to 37°C, lysis of red cells takes place in the presence of 
complement.  Consequently,  in  vivo  there  is  intravascular  hemolysis, 
resulting in hemoglobinuria. Clinically the differential diagnosis must 
include other causes of hemoglobinuria (Table 100-6), but the presence 
of the Donath-Landsteiner antibody will prove PCH. Active supportive 
treatment, including blood transfusion, may be needed to control the 
anemia; subsequently, recovery is the rule.
COLD  AGGLUTININ  DISEASE  This  designation  indicates  the  other 
main type of AIHA, which has quite different features when compared 
with  wAIHA.  First,  cold  agglutinin  disease  (CAD)  is  a  chronic  and 
more frequently indolent condition—in contrast to the abrupt onset of 
warm antibody AIHA. Second, the term cold refers to the fact that the 
autoantibody involved reacts with red cells poorly or not at all at 37°C, 
whereas it reacts strongly at lower temperatures. As a result, hemolysis 
is  more  prominent  the  more  the  body  is  exposed  to  the  cold.  Third, 
the  antibody  is  produced  by  a  clone  of  autoreactive  B  lymphocytes. 
Sometimes the antibody concentration in the serum is high enough to 
show up as a spike in plasma protein electrophoresis, thus qualifying 
CAD  as  an  IgM  monoclonal  gammopathy;  however,  it  differs  from 
Waldenström  macroglobulinemia  by  not  having  the  characteristic 
MYD88 mutation (see Chap. 111): there is instead, in the B-cell clone 
of a majority of CAD patients, a somatic mutation in the KMT2D gene, 
encoding a lysine histone methylase that seems to favor proliferation. 
The  antibody  produced  by  the  B-cell  clone  is  IgM;  usually  it  has  an 
anti-I  specificity  (the  I  antigen  is  present  on  the  red  cells  of  almost 
everybody), and it may have a very high titer (1:100,000 or more has 
been observed). IgM, when bound to red cells, is a powerful activator 
of the complement cascade, with ultimate formation of the membrane 
attack complex (see Fig. 100-9): this will directly cause destruction of 
red  cells  (intravascular  hemolysis:  indeed,  CAD  patients  may  present 
with hemoglobinuria). In addition, once complement is activated C3b 
will bind to red cells that, thus opsonized, will be destroyed by macro-
phages (extravascular hemolysis); unlike in AIHA, there is no predom-
inance of the spleen in this process.

In mild forms of CAD, avoidance of exposure to cold may be all that 
is needed to enable the patient to have a reasonably comfortable quality 
of life; but in more severe forms, the management of CAD is not easy. 
Plasma exchange will remove antibodies and is, therefore, in theory, a 
rational approach in severe cases. However, the management of CAD has 
changed significantly with the advent of the anti-CD20 antibody rituxi-
mab: up to 60% of patients respond. If remission is followed by relapse, a 
new course of rituximab may be again effective, and remissions may be 
more  durable  with  a  rituximab-fludarabine  combination,  in  particular 
in CAD associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, even

in the absence of a formal trial, rituximab has become de facto first-
line  treatment:  especially  since  previously  used  immunosuppressive/ 
cytotoxic agents, although they can reduce the antibody titer, have lim-
ited  clinical  efficacy  and,  in  view  of  the  chronic  nature  of  CAD,  their 
side  effects  may  prove  unacceptable.  Unlike  in  AIHA,  prednisone  and 
splenectomy are ineffective. In the management of CAD in relapse, there 
is  an  emerging  role  for  the  B-cell  receptor  inhibitors  venetoclax  and 
ibrutinib, as well as for the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. A different 
approach  targeting  complement  inhibitors  has  been  also  explored  by 
using eculizumab (anti-C5) or sutimlimab (anti-C1s): a limitation of this 
approach is that hemolysis will be curbed only for as long as these agents 
are administered.

In terms of supportive treatment, blood transfusion may be helpful—
in spite of the fact that red cells from the donor, being I-positive, will 
survive no longer than those of the patient: both the blood bag and the 
patient’s extremities must be kept warm during transfusion.

Hemolytic Anemia from Toxic Agents and Drugs  A number 
of  chemicals  with  oxidative  potential,  whether  medicinal  or  not,  can 
cause hemolysis even in people who are not G6PD deficient (for which, 
see above). Examples are hyperbaric oxygen (or 100% oxygen), nitrates, 
chlorates, methylene blue, dapsone, cisplatin, and numerous aromatic 
(cyclic)  compounds.  Other  chemicals  may  be  hemolytic  through 
nonoxidative, largely unknown mechanisms; examples include arsine, 
stibine, copper, and lead. The HA caused by lead poisoning is charac-
terized by basophilic stippling; it is in fact a phenocopy of that seen in 
P5N deficiency (see above), suggesting it is mediated at least in part by 
lead inhibiting this enzyme.

In these cases, hemolysis appears to be mediated by a direct chemi-
cal action on red cells. But drugs can cause hemolysis through at least 
two other mechanisms. (1) A drug can behave as a hapten and induce 
antibody production; in rare subjects, this happens, for instance, with 
penicillin. Upon a subsequent exposure, red cells are caught, as inno-
cent bystanders, in the reaction between penicillin and antipenicillin 
antibodies.  Hemolysis  will  subside  as  soon  as  penicillin  administra-
tion is stopped. (2) A drug can trigger, perhaps through mimicry, the 
production of an antibody against a red cell antigen. The best-known 

example  is  methyldopa,  an  antihypertensive  agent  no  longer  in  use, 
which in a small fraction of patients stimulated the production of the 
Rhesus antibody anti-e. In patients who have this antigen, the anti-e is 
a true autoantibody, which then causes true AIHA (see above). Usually 
this will gradually subside once methyldopa is discontinued.

Severe intravascular hemolysis can be caused by the venom of cer-

tain snakes (cobras and vipers), and HA can also follow spider bites.

Paroxysmal  Nocturnal  Hemoglobinuria  (PNH)  PNH  is  an 
acquired chronic HA characterized by persistent intravascular hemo-
lysis with occasional or frequent recurrent exacerbations. In addition 
to  (i)  hemolysis,  there  may  be  (ii)  pancytopenia  and  (iii)  a  distinct 
tendency to venous thrombosis. This triad makes PNH a truly unique 
clinical  condition;  however,  when  not  all  of  these  three  features  are 
manifest on presentation, the diagnosis is often delayed, although it can 
always be made by appropriate laboratory investigations (see below).

PNH  is  encountered  in  all  populations  throughout  the  world,  but 
it is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of ~5 per million (it 
may be somewhat less rare in Southeast Asia and in the Far East). PNH 
has about the same frequency in men and women. PNH is not inher-
ited, and it has never been reported as a congenital disease, but it can 
present in small children or as late as in the seventies, although most 
patients are young adults.

CLINICAL  FEATURES  When  seeking  medical  attention,  the  patient 
may report that one morning, she or he “passed blood instead of urine.” 
This  distressing  or  frightening  event  may  be  regarded  as  the  classic 
presentation;  however,  more  frequently,  this  symptom  is  not  noticed 
or not reported. Indeed, the patient often presents simply as a prob-
lem  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of  anemia,  whether  symptomatic  or 
discovered incidentally. Sometimes the anemia is associated from the 
outset with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or both, thus signaling an 
element of bone marrow failure (see below). Some patients may pres-
ent with recurrent attacks of severe abdominal pain eventually found 
to be related to thrombosis in abdominal veins, or attributable to NO 
depletion  associated  with  intravascular  hemolysis.  When  thrombosis 
affects the hepatic vein, it may produce acute hepatomegaly and ascites,

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyi.e., a full-fledged Budd-Chiari syndrome, which, in the absence of liver 
disease, ought to raise the suspicion of PNH.

The  natural  history  of  PNH  can  extend  over  decades.  In  the  past, 
with  supportive  treatment  only,  the  median  survival  was  estimated 
to be about 10–20 years, with the most common cause of death being 
venous thrombosis, followed by infection secondary to severe neutro-
penia and hemorrhage secondary to severe thrombocytopenia. Rarely 
(estimated  1–2%  of  all  cases),  PNH  may  terminate  in  acute  myeloid 
leukemia. On the other hand, full spontaneous recovery from PNH has 
been documented, albeit rarely.

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS  The most consistent 
blood  finding  is  anemia,  which  may  range  from  mild  to  moderate 
to  very  severe.  The  anemia  is  usually  normo-macrocytic,  with  unre-
markable red cell morphology. If the MCV is high, it is usually largely 
accounted  for  by  reticulocytosis,  which  may  be  quite  marked  (up  to 
20%,  or  up  to  400,000/μL).  The  anemia  may  become  microcytic  if 
the patient is allowed to become iron-deficient as a result of chronic 
iron  loss  through  hemoglobinuria.  Unconjugated  bilirubin  is  mildly 
or moderately elevated; LDH is typically markedly elevated (values in 
the thousands are common); and haptoglobin is usually undetectable. 
All of these findings make the diagnosis of HA compelling. Hemoglo-
binuria may be overt in a random urine sample; if it is not, it may be 
helpful  to  obtain  serial  urine  samples  (Fig.  100-9)  because  hemoglo-
binuria  can  vary  dramatically  from  day  to  day  and  even  from  hour 
to hour. The bone marrow is usually cellular, with marked to massive 
erythroid hyperplasia, often with mild to moderate dyserythropoietic 
features (these overlap with those seen in myelodysplastic syndromes, 
but PNH remains a separate entity). At some stage of the disease, the 
marrow may become hypocellular or even frankly aplastic (see below).
The  definitive  diagnosis  of  PNH  must  be  based  on  the  demon-
stration that a substantial proportion of the patient’s red cells have an 
increased  susceptibility  to  complement  (C),  due  to  the  deficiency  on 
their surface of proteins (particularly CD59 and CD55) that normally 
protect  the  red  cells  from  activated  C.  The  sucrose  hemolysis  test  is 
unreliable; in contrast, the acidified serum (Ham) test is highly reliable 
but is carried out only in a few laboratories. The gold standard today 
is flow cytometry, which can be carried out on granulocytes as well as 
on red cells and has a very high sensitivity. In PNH, characteristically, 
one  sees  a  bimodal  distribution  of  cells,  with  a  discrete  population 
that is CD59 and CD55 negative. Although very small populations of 
CD59(–) cells are of interest in terms of pathophysiology (particularly 
of aplastic anemia [AA]), no patient should be diagnosed with PNH 
unless the proportion is substantial: in first approximation at least 5% 
of the total red cells and at least 20% of the total granulocytes.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  Hemolysis  in  PNH  is  mainly  intravascular  and 
is  due  to  an  intrinsic  abnormality  of  the  red  cell,  which  makes  it 
exquisitely sensitive to activated C, whether C is activated through the 
alternative  pathway  or  through  an  antigen-antibody  reaction  (classic 
pathway).  The  former  mechanism  is  mainly  responsible  for  chronic 
hemolysis in PNH; the latter explains why the hemolysis can be dra-
matically  exacerbated  in  the  course  of  a  viral  or  bacterial  infection. 
Hypersusceptibility to C is due to deficiency in the red cell membrane 
of  several  protective  proteins  (Fig.  100-10),  among  which  CD59  is 
the most important because it is able to hinder the insertion into the 
membrane of C9 polymers (the so-called membrane attack complex, 
or  MAC).  The  molecular  basis  for  the  deficiency  of  these  proteins 
has been pinpointed not to a defect in any of the respective genes, but 
rather to the shortage of a unique glycolipid molecule, GPI (Fig. 100-2), 
which, through a peptide bond, anchors these proteins to the surface 
membrane  of  cells.  The  shortage  of  GPI  is  due  in  turn  to  a  somatic 
mutation in an X-linked gene, called PIGA, required for an early step 
in  GPI  biosynthesis.  As  a  result,  the  patient’s  marrow  is  a  mosaic  of 
mutant and nonmutant cells, and the peripheral blood always contains 
both GPI-negative (PNH) cells and GPI-positive (non-PNH) cells: in 
most cases the former prevail. Thrombosis is one of the most imme-
diately life-threatening complications of PNH, and yet one of the least 
understood  in  its  pathogenesis.  It  could  be  that  deficiency  of  CD59 
on the PNH platelet causes inappropriate platelet activation; however, 

other mechanisms are possible. In very rare cases PNH can be caused 
by  biallelic  mutations  of  the  PIGT  gene,  in  the  absence  of  a  PIGA 
mutation. In these cases, because GPI is produced but cannot bind to 
proteins, the clinical picture is further complicated by the coexistence 
of a chronic inflammatory state.

BONE  MARROW  FAILURE  (BMF)  AND  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  PNH 
AND  APLASTIC  ANEMIA  (AA)  It  is  not  unusual  that  patients  with 
firmly established PNH have a previous history of AA, sometimes well 
documented; indeed, BMF preceding overt PNH is probably the rule 
rather than the exception. On the other hand, sometimes a patient with 
PNH  becomes  less  hemolytic  and  more  pancytopenic  and  ultimately 
has the clinical picture of AA. The relationship between PNH and AA 
manifested  in  the  clinical  course  of  patients  may  reflect  a  close  link 
in  pathogenesis.  AA  is  thought  to  be  an  organ-specific  autoimmune 
disease, in which T cells cause damage to hematopoietic stem cells via 
an as yet unidentified molecular target. The same may be true of PNH, 
and in this condition the target might be the GPI molecule itself. This 
would  explain  why  GPI-negative  (PNH)  stem  cells  are  spared;  PIGA 
mutations can be demonstrated in normal people. Thus, PNH results 
from  the  combined  action  of  two  factors:  failure  of  normal  hemato-
poiesis and massive expansion of a PNH clone. There is evidence from 
mouse models that PNH stem cells do not expand on their own, and 
there  is  evidence  from  human  patients  that  expansion  is  associated 
with  negative  selection  against  GPI-positive  cells  by  GPI-specific  T 
cells.  Thus,  PNH  is  a  prime  example  of  a  clonal  disease  that  is  not 
malignant.

TREATMENT
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria

Until  some  15  years  ago  there  were  essentially  two  treatment 
options for PNH: either allogeneic BMT, providing a definitive cure 
at the cost of nonnegligible risks; or continued supportive treatment 
for what, unlike other acquired HAs, may be a lifelong condition. A 
major advance has been the introduction in 2007 of a humanized 
monoclonal antibody, eculizumab, which binds to the complement 
component C5 near the site that, when cleaved, will trigger the distal 
part of the complement cascade leading to formation of the MAC. 
With C5 blocked by anti-C5, the patient is relieved of intravascular 
hemolysis and of its attendant consequences, including hemoglobi-
nuria; with a substantial decrease in the rate of thrombosis. In the 
majority  of  those  patients  who  needed  regular  blood  transfusion, 
the  transfusion  requirement  is  either  abolished  or  significantly 
reduced.  For  many  PNH  patients,  eculizumab  has  meant  a  real 
improvement in the quality of life, as well as a decrease in compli-
cations, particularly thrombosis. At the same time, it is important 
to  know  that  in  patients  on  eculizumab  the  PNH  red  cells,  now 
protected  from  being  lysed  through  the  MAC,  do  still  bind  C3 
fragments and thus become opsonized. Therefore, hemolysis con-
tinues, but it is now extravascular. The extent to which this happens 
depends  in  part  on  a  genetic  polymorphism  of  the  complement 
receptor CR1. Those patients who, on eculizumab, are still receiving 
blood transfusion are at risk of iron overload. Based on its half-life, 
eculizumab  must  be  administered  intravenously  every  14  days.   
Ravulizumab,  a  long-lived  anti-C5  derivative  of  eculizumab,  is 
administered  at  8-week  rather  than  2-week  intervals:  it  provides 
similar benefit with obvious practical advantage.

Eculizumab  and  ravulizumab  are  very  expensive  and  for  this 
reason not accessible to patients in many parts of the world. There-
fore, the management of PNH by supportive treatment is still very 
important. Folic acid supplements (at least 3 mg/d) are mandatory; 
the  serum  iron  should  be  checked  periodically,  and  iron  supple-
ments should be administered as appropriate. Transfusion of white 
cell-free  red  cells  should  be  used  whenever  necessary,  which,  for 
some patients, means quite frequently. Long-term glucocorticoids 
are  not  indicated  because  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  have 
any  effect  on  chronic  hemolysis;  in  fact,  they  are  contraindicated

FIGURE 100-10  The complement cascade and the fate of red cells. A. In normal blood, when complement is activated, red cells are protected from lysis in several ways: 
primarily by the 2 glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked surface proteins CD55 (prevents binding of C3 fragments) and CD59 (prevents the membrane attack complex 
[MAC] from inserting into the membrane). B. PNH red cells are deficient in CD55 and CD59 because the GPI biosynthetic pathway is blocked as a result of a PIGA mutation; 
therefore, C3 fragments, particularly C3d, bind to their surface, and the red cells are rapidly lysed by the action of the MAC. C. With drugs (monoclonal antibodies) that bind 
to C5 and prevent it splitting into C5a and C5b, the entire distal pathway from C5 onward is blocked, MAC is not formed, and IVH is abrogated. However, red cells opsonized 
by C3d will be destroyed in the spleen and elsewhere; this drug-induced EVH varies in severity between patients. The Coombs test, which is characteristically negative in 
PNH, becomes positive (provided that a “broad spectrum” or an anticomplement reagent is used). D. With a drug that targets C3, C3b formation is inhibited, and the distal 
pathway is not triggered by C3b. Therefore, again, no MAC is formed (abrogating IVH), and, at the same time, opsonization of red cells by C3d is prevented, so that EVH is 
also curbed. The same is largely true for drugs that target factor B or factor D, although C3b can still be formed through the classical pathway. (Reproduced with permission 
from L Luzzatto: Control of hemolysis in patients with PNH. Blood 138:1909, 2021.)

because their side effects are considerable. A short course of pred-
nisone  may  be  useful  when  an  inflammatory  process  exacerbates 
hemolysis. Any patient who has had venous thrombosis or who has 
a  genetically  determined  thrombophilic  state  in  addition  to  PNH 
should  be  on  regular  anticoagulant  prophylaxis.  With  thrombotic 
complications  that  do  not  resolve  otherwise,  thrombolytic  treat-
ment with tissue plasminogen activator may be indicated.

Where  anti-C5  therapy  is  available  the  proportion  of  PNH 
patients  receiving  BMT  has  decreased  significantly.  However,  when 
an  HLA-identical  sibling  is  available,  BMT  should  be  taken  into 

consideration  for  any  young  patient  with  severe  PNH;  and  for 
patients with the so-called PNH-AA syndrome, since eculizumab has 
no effect on BMF. For these patients immunosuppressive treatment 
with  antithymocyte  globulin  and  cyclosporine  A  may  be  an  alter-
native, and it may be compatible with concurrent administration of 
eculizumab.

In view of persistent extravascular hemolysis, and sometimes per-
sistent blood transfusion requirement in PNH patients on C5 blockade 
therapy, there has been great stimulus to developing agents that may 
inhibit complement activation more upstream. Several compounds that 
inhibit either the convertase function of C3 or plasma factors required 
for this function are currently in clinical trials (see Fig. 100-11).

101 Anemia Due to Acute  
Blood Loss
Dan L. Longo

Blood loss causes anemia by two main mechanisms: (1) by the direct 
loss of red cells; and (2) if the loss of blood is protracted, it will gradu-
ally deplete iron stores, eventually resulting in iron deficiency. The lat-
ter type of anemia is covered in Chap. 97. Here, we are concerned with 
the former type, that is, posthemorrhagic anemia, which follows acute 
blood loss. This can be external (e.g., after trauma or obstetric hem-
orrhage)  or  internal  (e.g.,  from  bleeding  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract, 
rupture of the spleen, rupture of an ectopic pregnancy, subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, leaking aneurysm). In any of these cases, after the sudden 
loss of a large amount of blood, there are three clinical/pathophysio-
logic stages. (1) At first, the dominant feature is hypovolemia, which 
poses a threat particularly to organs that normally have a high blood 
supply, like the brain and the kidneys; therefore, loss of consciousness 
and acute renal failure are major threats. It is important to note that at 
this stage an ordinary blood count will not show anemia because the 
hemoglobin concentration is not affected. On physical exam, tachycar-
dia,  tachypnea,  decreased  pulse  pressure,  cold  skin  that  appears  pale 
and  mottled,  and  decreased  urine  output  may  be  noted.  (2)  Next,  as

an emergency response, baroreceptors and stretch receptors will cause 
release of vasopressin and other peptides, and the body will shift fluid 
from  the  extravascular  to  the  intravascular  compartment,  producing 
hemodilution;  thus,  the  hypovolemia  gradually  converts  to  anemia. 
The  degree  of  anemia  will  reflect  the  amount  of  blood  lost.  If  after  
3 days the hemoglobin is, for example, 7 g/dL, it means that about half 
of the entire blood has been lost. (3) Provided bleeding does not con-
tinue, the bone marrow response will gradually ameliorate the anemia. 
In this phase of the process, the reticulocyte count and erythropoietin 
levels  will  be  elevated.  The  physiologic  increase  in  marrow  red  cell 
production reflected by the increase in reticulocytes is similar to the 
marrow response to hemolysis.

The diagnosis of acute posthemorrhagic anemia (APHA) is usually 
straightforward, although sometimes internal bleeding episodes (e.g., 
after  a  traumatic  injury),  even  when  large,  may  not  be  immediately 
obvious. Look for physical findings that may help localize the bleeding. 
Grey Turner sign (flank ecchymosis) may reflect retroperitoneal bleed-
ing.  Cullen  sign  (umbilical  ecchymosis)  may  suggest  intraperitoneal 
or retroperitoneal bleeding. Dullness to chest percussion may suggest 
intrapleural  bleeding.  Whenever  an  abrupt  fall  in  hemoglobin  has 
taken place, whatever history is given by the patient, APHA should be 
suspected. Supplementary history may have to be obtained by asking 
the appropriate questions, and appropriate investigations (e.g., a sono-
gram or an endoscopy) may have to be carried out.

TREATMENT
Anemia Due to Acute Blood Loss

In  patients  who  are  hemodynamically  unstable,  the  usual  airway, 
breathing, and circulation assessments take priority. In the face of 
bleeding associated with hypotension, pharmacologic support with 
vasopressors  is  critical.  With  respect  to  anemia  treatment,  a  two-
pronged approach is imperative. (1) In many cases, the blood lost 
needs to be replaced promptly. Unlike with many chronic anemias, 
when  finding  and  correcting  the  cause  of  the  anemia  is  the  first 
priority and blood transfusion may not be even necessary because 
the body is adapted to the anemia, with acute blood loss, the reverse 
is true; because the body is not adapted to the anemia, blood trans-
fusion takes priority. (2) While the emergency is being confronted, 
it is imperative to stop the hemorrhage and to eliminate its source.
In  an  acute  hemorrhage  situation,  plasma  may  be  preferred  to 
saline for volume expansion since dilution of clotting factors with 
crystalloid may interfere with hemostasis.

A  special  type  of  APHA  is  blood  loss  during  and  immediately 
after surgery, which can be substantial (e.g., up to 2 L in the case of a 
radical prostatectomy). Of course with elective surgical procedures, 
the patient’s own stored blood may be available (through preopera-
tive autologous blood donation), and in any case, blood loss ought 
to have been carefully monitored/measured. The fact that this blood 
loss is iatrogenic dictates that ever more effort should be invested 
in optimizing its management. The special features of transfusion 
medicine are discussed in Chap. 113.

A  Holy  Grail  of  emergency  medicine  for  a  long  time  has  been 
the  idea  of  a  blood  substitute  that  would  be  universally  available, 
suitable for all recipients, easy to store and to transport, safe, and 
as effective as blood itself. Two main paths have been pursued: (1) 
fluorocarbon synthetic chemicals that bind oxygen reversibly, and 
(2) artificially modified hemoglobins, known as hemoglobin-based 
oxygen carriers (HBOCs). Although there are numerous anecdotal 
reports  of  the  use  of  both  approaches  in  humans,  and  although 
HBOCs  have  reached  the  stage  of  phase  2–3  clinical  trials,  no 
“blood substitute” has yet become standard treatment.

102 Bone Marrow Failure 
Syndromes Including  
Aplastic Anemia and 
Myelodysplasia
Neal S. Young

Bone marrow failure diseases include aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic 
syndrome  (MDS),  pure  red  cell  aplasia  (PRCA),  and  myelophthisis. 
Hypoproliferative anemia is a cardinal feature of these disorders, but 
more  frequent  is  pancytopenia:  anemia,  leukopenia,  and  thrombo-
cytopenia.  Low  blood  counts  in  marrow  failure  result  from  deficient 
hematopoiesis,  as  distinguished  from  blood  count  depression  due 
to  peripheral  destruction  of  red  cells  (hemolytic  anemias),  platelets 
(idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP] or due to splenomegaly), 
and  granulocytes  (as  in  the  immune  leukopenias).  Marrow  damage 
and  dysfunction  also  may  be  secondary  to  infection,  inflammation, 
or cancer.

Hematopoietic  failure  syndromes  are  classified  by  dominant  mor-
phologic  features  of  the  bone  marrow  (Table  102-1).  Although 
practical  distinction  among  these  syndromes  usually  is  clear  from 
the marrow pathology, some processes are so closely related that the 
diagnosis  may  be  complex.  Separation  between  aplastic  anemia  and 
hypocellular MDS can be particularly difficult. Mutations on genomic 
screens  may  be  etiologic  or  interpreted  as  risk  factors.  Patients  may 
seem  to  suffer  from  two  or  three  related  diseases  simultaneously,  or 
one diagnosis may appear to evolve into another. Many of these syn-
dromes share an immune-mediated mechanism of marrow destruction 
and some element of genomic instability resulting in a higher rate of 
malignant transformation.

It is important that the internist and general practitioner recognize 
the  marrow  failure  syndromes  because  quality  of  life  and  ultimate 
prognosis may be poor if the patient is untreated; effective therapies are 
often available but sufficiently complicated in their choice and delivery 
so  as  to  warrant  the  care  of  a  hematologist  or  oncologist.  While  the 
identification  of  pathogenic  mutations  on  genomic  screen,  often  on 
testing ordered by the internist and pediatrician, has revolutionized the 
diagnosis of the marrow failure syndromes, these results often require 
the interpretation of the hematologist and oncologist.

APLASTIC ANEMIA
 ■ DEFINITION
Aplastic  anemia  is  pancytopenia  with  bone  marrow  hypocellularity. 
Acquired  aplastic  anemia  is  distinguished  from  iatrogenic  aplasia, 
from  marrow  hypocellularity  after  intensive  cytotoxic  chemotherapy 
for cancer, and from usually accidental physical and chemical injury, 
as in radiation poisoning. Aplastic anemia can also be constitutional. 
Genetic  diseases  such  as  Fanconi  anemia  and  dyskeratosis  congenita 
usually  (but  not  always)  present  in  early  childhood  and  have  typical 
physical  anomalies.  Telomere  diseases  (see  Chap.  469)  and  hemato-
logic  manifestations  of  mutations  in  genes  such  as  GATA2,  RUNX1, 
and  MPL  can  present  as  marrow  failure  in  normal-appearing  adults.

Acquired  aplastic  anemia  is  often  stereotypical  in  its  manifestations, 
with the abrupt onset of low blood counts in a previously well young 
adult;  seronegative  hepatitis  or  a  course  of  an  incriminated  medical 
drug may precede the onset. The diagnosis in these instances is uncom-
plicated.  Sometimes  blood  count  depression  is  moderate  or  incom-
plete, resulting in anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in some 
combination. Aplastic anemia is related to both paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH; Chap. 100) and to MDS, and a clear distinction 
among these disorders may not be possible.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
The incidence of acquired aplastic anemia in Europe and Israel is two 
cases  per  million  persons  annually.  In  Thailand  and  China,  rates  of 
five to seven per million have been established. Men and women are 
affected with equal frequency, but the age distribution is biphasic, with 
the  major  peak  in  the  teens  and  twenties  and  a  second  rise  in  older 
adults.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
The origins of aplastic anemia have been inferred from several recur-
ring clinical associations (Table 102-2); unfortunately, these relation-
ships are not reliable in an individual patient and may not be etiologic. 
In addition, although most cases of aplastic anemia are idiopathic, little 
other than history separates these cases from those with a presumed 
etiology such as a drug exposure.

Radiation  Marrow  aplasia  is  a  major  acute  sequela  of  radiation. 
Radiation  damages  DNA;  tissues  dependent  on  active  mitosis  are 
particularly  susceptible.  Nuclear  accidents  involve  not  only  power 
plant workers but also employees of hospitals, laboratories, and indus-
try  (food  sterilization,  metal  radiography,  etc.),  as  well  as  innocents 
exposed to stolen, misplaced, or misused sources. Whereas the radia-
tion dose can be approximated from the rate and degree of decline in 
blood counts, dosimetry by reconstruction of the exposure can help to 
estimate the patient’s prognosis and also to protect medical personnel

from contact with radioactive tissue and excreta. MDS and leukemia, 
but probably not aplastic anemia, are late effects of radiation.

Chemicals  Benzene  is  a  notorious  cause  of  bone  marrow  failure: 
epidemiologic,  clinical,  and  laboratory  data  link  benzene  to  aplastic 
anemia, acute leukemia, and blood and marrow abnormalities. For leu-
kemia, incidence is correlated with cumulative exposure, but suscepti-
bility must also be important because only a minority of even heavily 
exposed  workers  develop  myelotoxicity.  The  employment  history  is 
important, especially in industries where benzene is used for a second-
ary purpose, usually as a solvent. Benzene-related blood diseases have 
declined with regulation of industrial exposure. Although benzene is 
no  longer  generally  available  as  a  household  solvent,  exposure  to  its 
metabolites  occurs  in  the  normal  diet  and  in  the  environment.  The 
association between marrow failure and other chemicals is much less 
well  substantiated.  Further,  there  is  scant  direct  evidence  of  marrow 
failure as a late effect of exposure, even to benzene.

Drugs (Table 102-3)  Many chemotherapeutic drugs have marrow 
suppression  as  a  major  toxicity;  effects  are  dose  dependent  and  will

TABLE 102-3  Some Drugs and Chemicals Associated with Aplastic 
Anemia
Agents that regularly produce marrow depression as major toxicity in commonly 
used doses or normal exposures:

 Cytotoxic drugs used in cancer chemotherapy: alkylating agents, 
antimetabolites, antimitotics, some antibiotics

Agents that frequently but not inevitably produce marrow aplasia:
  Benzene
Agents associated with aplastic anemia but with a relatively low probability:
  Chloramphenicol
Insecticides

  Antiprotozoals: quinacrine and chloroquine, mepacrine

 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including phenylbutazone, 
indomethacin, ibuprofen, sulindac, aspirin)

  Anticonvulsants (hydantoins, carbamazepine, phenacemide, felbamate)
  Heavy metals (gold, arsenic, bismuth, mercury)

 Sulfonamides: some antibiotics, antithyroid drugs (methimazole,

chlorpropamide), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide and 
methazolamide)

occur  in  all  recipients.  In  contrast,  idiosyncratic  reactions  to  a  large 
and diverse group of drugs may lead to aplastic anemia without a clear 
dose-response  relationship.  A  large  international  study  in  Europe  in 
the  1980s  quantitated  drug  relationships,  especially  for  nonsteroidal 
analgesics, sulfonamides, thyrostatic drugs, some psychotropics, peni-
cillamine, allopurinol, and gold. Association does not equal causation: 
a drug may have been used to treat the first symptoms of bone marrow 
failure  (antibiotics  for  fever  or  a  preceding  viral  illness)  or  provoked 
the  first  symptom  of  a  preexisting  disease  (petechiae  by  nonsteroi-
dal  anti-inflammatory  agents  administered  to  the  thrombocytopenic 
patient).  In  the  context  of  total  drug  use,  idiosyncratic  reactions, 
although  individually  devastating,  are  rare  events.  Risk  estimates  are 
usually lower when determined in population-based studies. Further-
more, the low absolute risk is also made more obvious: even a 10- or 
20-fold increase in risk translates, in a rare disease, to just a handful of 
drug-induced aplastic anemia cases among hundreds of thousands of 
exposed persons.

Infections  Transient,  mild  blood  count  depression  is  frequent  in 
the course of many viral and bacterial infections. Aplastic anemia can 
rarely follow infectious mononucleosis. Parvovirus B19 does not usu-
ally cause generalized bone marrow failure.

Immunologic Diseases  Aplasia  is  a  major  consequence  and  the 
inevitable  cause  of  death  in  transfusion-associated  graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD) that can occur after infusion of nonirradiated blood 

products to an immunodeficient recipient. Aplastic anemia is strongly 
associated with the rare collagen vascular syndrome eosinophilic fasci-
itis that is characterized by painful induration of subcutaneous tissues 
(Chap. 360). Thymoma and hypoimmunoglobulinemia are occasional 
associations with aplastic anemia. Pancytopenia with marrow hypopla-
sia can also occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Hepatitis  Posthepatitis marrow failure accounts for ∼5% of etiolo-
gies in most series. Patients are usually young men who have recovered 
from a bout of liver inflammation 1–2 months earlier; the subsequent 
pancytopenia is very severe. The hepatitis is seronegative (non-A, non-
B, non-C); intensive laboratory efforts including deep sequencing have 
not disclosed an infectious agent, and the hepatitis is presumed to be 
immune-mediated.  Fulminant  liver  failure  in  childhood  can  follow 
seronegative hepatitis, and marrow failure occurs at a high rate in these 
patients.

Pregnancy  Aplastic anemia very rarely may occur and recur during 
pregnancy and resolve with delivery or with spontaneous or induced 
abortion.

Paroxysmal  Nocturnal  Hemoglobinuria  An  acquired  muta-
tion in the PIG-A gene in a hematopoietic stem cell is required for the 
development of PNH, but PIG-A mutations probably occur commonly 
in normal individuals. If the PIG-A mutant stem cell proliferates, the 
result  is  a  clone  of  progeny  deficient  in  glycosylphosphatidylinositol- 
linked  cell  surface  membrane  proteins  (Chap.  100).  Small  clones  of 
deficient  cells  can  be  detected  by  sensitive  flow  cytometry  tests  in 
one-half  or  more  of  patients  with  aplastic  anemia  at  the  time  of  pre-
sentation. Functional studies of bone marrow from PNH patients, even 
those with mainly hemolytic manifestations, show evidence of defective 
hematopoiesis. Patients with an initial clinical diagnosis of PNH, espe-
cially younger individuals, may later develop frank marrow aplasia and 
pancytopenia; patients with an initial diagnosis of aplastic anemia may 
suffer later from hemolytic PNH years after recovery of blood counts.

Constitutional  Syndromes  Fanconi  anemia,  an  autosomal 
recessive  disorder,  manifests  as  congenital  developmental  anomalies, 
progressive pancytopenia, and an increased risk of malignancy. Chro-
mosomes  in  Fanconi  anemia  are  susceptible  to  DNA  cross-linking 
agents, the basis for a diagnostic assay. Patients with Fanconi anemia 
typically have short stature, café au lait spots, and anomalies involving 
the thumb, radius, and genitourinary tract. At least 17 different genetic 
defects  (all  but  one  with  an  identified  gene)  have  been  defined;  the 
most common, type A Fanconi anemia, is due to a mutation in FANCA. 
Most of the Fanconi anemia gene products form a protein complex that 
activates FANCD2 by monoubiquitination to play a role in the cellular 
response to DNA damage and especially interstrand cross-linking.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (see below) and Shwachman-Diamond 
syndrome are ribosomopathies, genetic defects in ribosome assembly 
that  are  tissue  specific.  In  Shwachman-Diamond  syndrome,  presen-
tation  is  early  in  life  with  neutropenia,  pancreatic  insufficiency,  and 
malabsorption; most patients have compound heterozygous mutations 
in SBDS.

In  the  telomeropathies,  inherited  genetic  defects  alter  telomere 
repair or one of the shelterin protein components of the telomere. The 
pediatric syndrome dyskeratosis congenita is characterized by the triad 
of  mucous  membrane  leukoplasia,  dystrophic  nails,  reticular  hyper-
pigmentation, and early development of aplastic anemia (Chap. 469). 
Dyskeratosis  congenita  is  due  to  mutations  in  genes  of  the  telomere 
repair complex, which acts to maintain telomere length in replicating 
cells: the X-linked variety is due to mutations in the DKC1 (dyskerin) 
gene; the more unusual autosomal dominant type is due to mutation 
in TERC, which encodes an RNA template. Rarely, mutations can also 
occur in genes such as TNF2 that encode shelterin proteins, which bind 
telomere DNA.

Mutations in TERC and TERT, which encodes the catalytic reverse 
transcriptase telomerase, have subtle and milder effects on hematopoi-
etic function, and presentation in adults is not unusual. It manifests as 
moderate aplastic anemia, which can be chronic and not progressive,

and  isolated  macrocytic  anemia  or 
thrombocytopenia.  Physical  anomalies 
are  usually  not  present,  but  early  hair 
graying  is  a  clue  to  the  diagnosis.  A 
detailed personal and family history may 
disclose pulmonary fibrosis and hepatic 
cirrhosis. Variable penetrance means that 
TERT  and  TERC  mutations  represent 
risk factors for marrow failure, as family 
members with the same mutations may 
have  normal  or  only  slight  hematologic 
abnormalities  but  more  subtle  evidence 
of (compensated) hematopoietic insuffi-
ciency. Measurement of telomere length 
of peripheral blood leukocytes is a com-
mercially available functional test.
 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Bone marrow failure results from severe 
damage  to  the  hematopoietic  cell  com-
partment.  In  aplastic  anemia,  replace-
ment  of  the  bone  marrow  by  fat  is 
apparent in the morphology of the biopsy 
specimen (Fig. 102-1) and magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI) of the spine. Cells 
bearing  the  CD34  antigen,  a  marker 
of  early  hematopoietic  cells,  are  greatly 
diminished,  and  in  functional  studies, 
committed  and  primitive  progenitor 
cells are virtually absent; in vitro assays 
have  suggested  that  the  stem  cell  pool 
is  reduced  to  ≤1%  of  normal  in  severe 
disease at the time of presentation.

cells. C. Aplastic anemia biopsy. D. Marrow smear in aplastic anemia. The marrow shows replacement of hematopoietic

Constitutional Genetic Syndromes  
An intrinsic stem cell defect exists for the constitutional aplastic ane-
mias: in a critical DNA repair pathway in Fanconi anemia, manifested 
in the laboratory as chromosome damage and cell death on exposure 
to certain chemical agents. In the telomeropathies, inability to repair 
telomeres  or  to  protect  chromosome  ends  is  the  result  of  mutations 
in genes of the telomerase complex or the shelterin proteins; telomere 
defects limit the cell’s capacity to proliferate. Mutations in the GATA 
and RUNX genes affect signal transduction and transcriptional regula-
tion in hematopoietic gene networks.

Chemical and Drug Injury  Extrinsic damage to the marrow fol-
lows massive physical or chemical insults such as high doses of radia-
tion and toxic chemicals. For the more common idiosyncratic reaction 
to modest doses of medical drugs, altered drug metabolism has been 
invoked as a mechanism. The metabolic pathways of many drugs and 
chemicals, especially if they are polar and have limited water solubility, 
involve  enzymatic  degradation  to  highly  reactive  electrophilic  com-
pounds;  these  intermediates  are  toxic  because  of  their  propensity  to 
bind to cellular macromolecules. For example, derivative hydroquino-
nes and quinolones are responsible for benzene-induced tissue injury. 
Excessive  generation  of  toxic  intermediates  or  failure  to  detoxify  the 
intermediates  may  be  genetically  determined  and  apparent  only  on 
specific drug challenge; the complexity and specificity of the pathways 
imply multiple susceptibility loci and would provide an explanation for 
the rarity of idiosyncratic drug reactions.

Immune-Mediated  Stem  Cell  Destruction  The  recovery  of 
marrow  function  in  some  patients  prepared  for  bone  marrow  trans-
plantation  with  antilymphocyte  globulin  first  suggested  that  aplastic 
anemia  might  be  immune  mediated.  Laboratory  data,  including 
animal models, support an important role for the immune system in 
aplastic  anemia.  Blood  and  bone  marrow  cells  of  patients  can  sup-
press  normal  hematopoietic  progenitor  cell  growth,  and  removal  of 
T cells from aplastic anemia bone marrow improves hematopoiesis in 
vitro.  Increased  numbers  of  activated  cytotoxic  T-cell  clones  usually 

decline with successful immunosuppressive therapy; type 1 cytokines 
are  implicated;  and  interferon  γ  (IFN-γ)  induces  Fas  expression  on 
CD34 cells, leading to apoptotic cell death. Hematopoietic stem cells 
that  have  lost  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  expression  may  be 
selectively  expanded.  The  rarity  of  aplastic  anemia  despite  common 
exposures (medicines, seronegative hepatitis) suggests that genetically 
determined  features  of  the  immune  response  can  convert  a  normal 
physiologic response into a sustained abnormal autoimmune process, 
including  polymorphisms  in  histocompatibility  antigens,  cytokine 
genes, and genes that regulate T-cell polarization (maturation toward 
helper or cytotoxic phenotypes) and effector function.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
History  Aplastic anemia can appear abruptly or insidiously. Bleed-
ing is the most common early symptom; a complaint of days to weeks 
of easy bruising, oozing from the gums, nose bleeds, heavy menstrual 
flow,  and  sometimes  petechiae  will  have  been  noticed.  With  throm-
bocytopenia,  massive  hemorrhage  is  unusual,  but  small  amounts  of 
bleeding in the central nervous system can result in catastrophic intra-
cranial or retinal hemorrhage. Symptoms of anemia are also frequent, 
including  lassitude,  weakness,  shortness  of  breath,  and  a  pounding 
sensation in the ears. Infection is an unusual first symptom in aplastic 
anemia (unlike in agranulocytosis, where pharyngitis, anorectal infec-
tion, or frank sepsis occurs early). Patients often feel and look remark-
ably well despite drastically reduced blood counts. Systemic complaints 
and weight loss should point to other etiologies of pancytopenia. Prior 
medical  drug  use,  chemical  exposure,  and  preceding  viral  illnesses 
must  often  be  elicited  with  directed  questioning.  A  family  history  of 
hematologic  diseases  or  blood  abnormalities,  of  pulmonary  or  liver 
fibrosis,  or  of  early  hair  graying  points  to  a  telomeropathy;  a  family 
history of unusual infections and warts points to GATA2 deficiency.

Physical Examination  Petechiae and ecchymoses are typical, and 
retinal  hemorrhages  may  be  present.  Pelvic  and  rectal  examinations

can  often  be  deferred  but,  when  performed,  should  be  undertaken 
with great gentleness to avoid trauma; these may show bleeding from 
the cervical os and blood in the stool. Pallor of the skin and mucous 
membranes is common. Infection on presentation is unusual but may 
occur if the patient has been symptomatic for a few weeks. Lymphade-
nopathy and splenomegaly are highly atypical of aplastic anemia. Café 
au lait spots and short stature suggest Fanconi anemia; peculiar nails 
and leukoplakia suggest dyskeratosis congenita; early graying (and use 
of hair dyes to mask it!) suggests a telomerase defect.

 ■ LABORATORY STUDIES
Blood  The smear shows large erythrocytes and a paucity of platelets 
and  granulocytes.  Mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV)  is  commonly 
increased.  Reticulocytes  are  absent  or  few,  and  lymphocyte  numbers 
may be normal or reduced. The presence of immature myeloid forms 
suggests leukemia or MDS; nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) suggest 
marrow  fibrosis  or  tumor  invasion;  abnormal  platelets  suggest  either 
peripheral destruction or MDS.

Bone  Marrow  The  bone  marrow  is  usually  readily  aspirated  but 
dilute on smear, and the fatty biopsy specimen may be grossly pale on 
withdrawal;  a  “dry  tap”  instead  suggests  fibrosis  or  myelophthisis.  In 
severe aplasia, the smear of the aspirated specimen shows only red cells, 
residual lymphocytes, and stromal cells; the biopsy (which should be 
>1 cm in length) is superior for determination of cellularity and shows 
mainly fat under the microscope, with hematopoietic cells occupying 
<25% of the marrow space; sometimes, the biopsy is virtually all fat. 
The  correlation  between  marrow  cellularity  and  disease  severity  is 
imperfect;  patients  with  moderate  disease  by  blood  counts  can  have 
empty  iliac  crest  biopsies,  whereas  “hot  spots”  of  hematopoiesis  may 
be  seen  in  severe  cases.  Residual  hematopoietic  cells  should  have 
normal  morphology,  except  for  mildly  megaloblastic  erythropoiesis; 
megakaryocytes  are  greatly  reduced  and  usually  absent.  Granulomas 
may indicate an infectious etiology of the marrow failure.

Ancillary  Studies  Chromosome  breakage  studies  of  peripheral 
blood using diepoxybutane or mitomycin C should be performed on 
children  and  younger  adults  to  exclude  Fanconi  anemia.  Very  short 
telomere  length  strongly  suggests  the  presence  of  a  telomerase  or 
shelterin mutation, which can be pursued by family studies and nucle-
otide sequencing. Chromosome studies of bone marrow cells are often 
revealing  in  MDS  but  should  be  negative  in  typical  aplastic  anemia. 
Flow  cytometry  offers  a  sensitive  diagnostic  test  for  PNH.  Serologic 
studies may show evidence of recent viral infection, such as Epstein-
Barr virus and HIV. Posthepatitis aplastic anemia is seronegative.

Genomics  Next-generation  sequencing  allows  for  large  number  of 
genes to be tested for the presence of pathogenic mutations. Panels are 
available  commercially  and  in  certified  academic  laboratories.  While 
expensive, they are very useful and sometimes critical in establishing the 
correct diagnosis. Germline gene panels examine 50 or more genes eti-
ologic in constitutional bone marrow failure, including many for which 
functional assays (described above) are not available. A germline panel 
should be considered for all children and those adults with suggestive 
clinical features or family histories. Somatic mutations are sought when 
MDS is suspected. Myeloid neoplasm gene panels can query about 100 
genes that are recurrently mutated in MDS and acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML).  Pathogenic  mutations  in  spliceosome  genes  and  genes  in  the 
cohesion family are frequent in MDS and unexpected in aplastic anemia.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of aplastic anemia is usually straightforward, based on 
the  combination  of  pancytopenia  with  a  fatty  bone  marrow.  Aplastic 
anemia is a disease of the young and should be a leading diagnosis in 
the  pancytopenic  adolescent  or  young  adult.  When  pancytopenia  is 
secondary, the primary diagnosis is usually obvious from either history 
or physical examination: the massive spleen of alcoholic cirrhosis, the 
history  of  metastatic  cancer  or  SLE,  or  miliary  tuberculosis  on  chest 
radiograph (Table 102-1).

Diagnostic  problems  can  occur  with  atypical  presentations  and 
among  related  hematologic  diseases.  Patients  with  bone  marrow 
hypocellularity may have depression of only one or two of three blood 
lines,  with  later  progression  to  pancytopenia.  The  most  important 
differential diagnoses are between acquired and constitutional aplastic 
anemia,  and  between  aplastic  anemia  and  MDS.  The  bone  marrow 
in  constitutional  aplastic  anemia  is  usually  morphologically  indis-
tinguishable  from  the  aspirate  in  acquired  disease  (an  exception  is 
GATA2  deficiency  with  its  characteristic  megakaryocyte  atypia).  The 
diagnosis can be suggested by family history, abnormal blood counts 
since childhood, or the presence of associated, sometimes subtle phys-
ical  anomalies.  Genomic  testing  for  pathogenic  mutations  in  genes 
etiologic in constitutional marrow failure syndromes can discriminate 
acquired  from  inherited  aplastic  anemia  (but  results  may  not  return 
for  several  weeks,  a  problem  in  the  severely  pancytopenic  patient). 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MDS in a pedigree should prompt 
screening  for  an  inherited  predispositon  syndrome,  such  as  RUNX1 
mutations.  Aplastic  anemia  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the 
hypocellular variety of MDS: MDS is favored by finding morphologic 
abnormalities, particularly of megakaryocytes and myeloid precursor 
cells,  and  typical  cytogenetic  abnormalities  and  somatic  mutations 
on genomic screening of myeloid neoplasm genes (see above). There 
remains  an  unclear  boundary  between  immune  aplastic  anemia  and 
low-risk MDS: patients with deletion of 13q and 20q may respond well 
to immunosuppression, and mutations in genes such as DNMT3A and 
ASXL1 occur in both diseases.
 ■ PROGNOSIS
The natural history of severe aplastic anemia is rapid deterioration and 
death. Historically, provision first of RBCs and later of platelet trans-
fusions and effective antibiotics were of some benefit, but few patients 
show spontaneous recovery. The major prognostic determinant is the 
blood count. Severe disease historically has been defined by the pres-
ence  of  two  of  three  parameters:  absolute  neutrophil  count  <500/μL, 
platelet  count  <20,000/μL,  and  corrected  reticulocyte  count  <1%  (or 
absolute reticulocyte count <60,000/μL). In the era of effective immu-
nosuppressive  therapies,  absolute  numbers  of  reticulocytes  (>25,000/
μL) and lymphocytes (>1000/μL) may be better predictors of response 
to treatment and long-term outcome.

Other  prognostic  factors  include  the  presence  of  a  PNH  clone, 
short telomeres on presentation, and somatically mutated white cells. 
Even small PNH clones may indicate an immune pathophysiology and 
responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapies. Telomere shortening 
in most patients likely reflects stem cell reserve, regenerative stress, and 
susceptibility to chromosomal instability. Collectively, the presence of 
mutations  in  the  same  myeloid  neoplasia  genes  that  are  mutated  in 
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (ASXL1, DNMT3A) is 
associated with worse prognosis and clonal evolution.

TREATMENT
Aplastic Anemia

Severe acquired aplastic anemia can be cured by replacement of the 
absent hematopoietic cells (and the immune system) by stem cell 
transplant, or it can be ameliorated by suppression of the immune 
system to allow recovery of the patient’s residual bone marrow func-
tion. Glucocorticoids are not of value as primary therapy. Suspect 
exposures to drugs or chemicals should be discontinued; however, 
spontaneous recovery of severe blood count depression is rare, and 
a waiting period before beginning treatment may not be advisable 
unless the blood counts are only modestly depressed. 
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
This is the first choice for the younger patient with a fully histocom-
patible sibling donor (Chap. 114). HLA typing should be ordered as 
soon as the diagnosis of aplastic anemia is established in a child or 
younger adult. In transplant candidates, transfusion of blood from 
family members should be avoided so as to prevent sensitization to 
histocompatibility  antigens.  In  general,  limited  numbers  of  blood 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   796

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyproducts  probably  do  not  greatly  affect  outcome,  especially  when 
blood products are depleted of leukocytes. For allogeneic transplant 
from  fully  matched  siblings,  long-term  survival  rates  for  children 
are ∼90%. Transplant morbidity and mortality are increased among 
adults,  due  to  the  higher  risk  of  chronic  GVHD  and  infections. 
Nevertheless,  transplant  should  be  considered  early  in  all  but  the 
most elderly, including from alternative donors.

Most patients do not have a suitable sibling donor. Occasionally, 
a full phenotypic match can be found within the family and serve as 
well. Matched unrelated donors in large registries are available for 
the majority of Caucasian patients. With high-resolution matching 
at HLA, outcomes are similar to those with sibling donors, although 
complications  (mainly  GVHD  and  infection)  are  more  frequent. 
Cord blood also can be a source of stem cells, especially for chil-
dren.  Matched  unrelated  donor  transplants  are  often  considered 
as  initial  treatment  in  children  and  as  salvage  therapy  for  adults 
after  failed  immunosuppression.  Transplantation  from  an  HLA 
haploidentical  family  donor  is  increasingly  popular,  as  a  donor  is 
almost always quickly available. There is large experience in China, 
where  lymphocyte  depletion  is  usually  performed  before  donor 
cell  infusion.  Posttransplant  cyclophosphamide  appears  effective 
in preventing GVHD. Transplant protocols for marrow failure now 
usually do not include radiation in order to avoid late occurrence 
of cancer. 

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
The standard regimen of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in combi-
nation with cyclosporine induces hematologic recovery (indepen-
dence from transfusion and a leukocyte count adequate to prevent 
infection)  in  60–70%  of  patients.  Children  do  especially  well, 
whereas  older  adult  patients  can  suffer  complications  due  to  the 
presence  of  comorbidities.  An  early  robust  hematologic  response 
correlates  with  long-term  survival.  Improvement  in  granulocyte 
number is generally apparent within 2 months of treatment. Most 
recovered  patients  continue  to  have  some  degree  of  blood  count 
depression,  the  MCV  remains  elevated,  and  bone  marrow  cellu-
larity  returns  toward  normal  very  slowly  if  at  all.  Relapse  (recur-
rent  pancytopenia)  is  frequent,  often  occurring  as  cyclosporine 
is  tapered  or  discontinued;  most,  but  not  all,  patients  respond  to 
reinstitution of immunosuppression, but some responders become 
dependent on continued cyclosporine administration. “Clonal evo-
lution,” isolated chromosomal abnormalities or the development of 
MDS,  with  typical  cytogenetic  aberrations  and  abnormal  marrow 
morphology,  occurs  in  ∼15%  of  treated  patients  over  a  decade 
following  initiation  of  ATG,  usually  but  not  invariably  associated 
with a return of pancytopenia, and some patients develop leukemia. 
A laboratory diagnosis of PNH can generally be made at the time 
of  presentation  of  aplastic  anemia  by  flow  cytometry;  recovered 
patients may have frank hemolysis if the PNH clone expands. Bone 
marrow examinations should be performed if there is an unfavor-
able change in blood counts.

Horse  ATG  is  administered  as  intravenous  infusions  and 
requires hospitalization. Rabbit ATG is much less effective, perhaps 
because  it  reduces  T-regulatory  cell  numbers  in  patients.  Serum 
sickness,  a  flulike  illness  with  a  characteristic  cutaneous  eruption 
and  arthralgia,  may  develop  ∼10  days  after  initiating  treatment. 
Methylprednisolone  is  administered  with  ATG  to  ameliorate  the 
immune consequences of heterologous protein infusion. (Excessive 
or  extended  glucocorticoid  therapy  is  associated  with  avascular 
joint  necrosis.)  Cyclosporine  is  administered  orally  at  an  initial 
high  dose,  with  subsequent  adjustment  according  to  blood  levels. 
Its  most  important  side  effects  are  nephrotoxicity,  hypertension, 
and seizures.

Most patients with aplastic anemia lack a suitable marrow donor, 
and immunosuppression is the treatment of choice. Overall survival 
is equivalent with transplantation and immunosuppression. How-
ever,  successful  transplant  cures  marrow  failure,  whereas  patients 
who  recover  adequate  blood  counts  after  immunosuppression 
remain  at  risk  of  relapse  and  malignant  evolution.  Increasing  age

and  the  severity  of  neutropenia  are  the  most  important  factors 
weighing in the decision between transplant and immunosuppres-
sion in adults who have a matched family donor: older patients do 
better with ATG and cyclosporine, whereas transplant is preferred 
if neutropenia is profound. 
ELTROMBOPAG
Hematopoietic  growth  factors  (HGFs)  such  as  erythropoietin 
(EPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are not 
effective  in  aplastic  anemia,  probably  because  endogenous  blood 
levels  in  patients  are  extremely  high.  Circulating  thrombopoietin 
is also elevated, but a thrombopoietin mimetic showed unexpected 
activity  in  refractory  disease,  producing  robust,  trilineage,  and 
usually  durable  hematologic  responses.  Likely  the  mechanism  of 
action  of  thrombopoietin  mimetics  is  stimulation  of  the  hemato-
poietic stem cell, but iron chelation and increased regulatory T cells 
are also possibly beneficial effects. Eltrombopag added to first-line 
immunosuppression  with  horse  ATG  markedly  increased  overall 
and complete response rates, to about 80% and 50%, respectively. 
Eltrombopag is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) as monotherapy for refractory aplastic anemia and in 
combination with horse ATG and cyclosporine as initial therapy.

Transplant  from  a  suitable  donor  is  preferred  in  the  young 
patient, whereas immunosuppression is preferred in the older adult. 
Even  heavily  transfused  and  infected  patients  in  whom  immuno-
suppression has failed can be salvaged by stem cell transplant later. 
ANDROGENS
The effectiveness of androgens has not been verified in controlled 
trials,  but  occasional  patients  will  respond  or  even  demonstrate 
blood  count  dependence  on  continued  therapy.  Sex  hormones 
upregulate telomerase gene activity in vitro, which is possibly also 
their  mechanism  of  action  in  improving  marrow  function.  For 
patients with moderate disease, especially if a telomere gene defect 
is  present,  a  3-  to  4-month  trial  may  improve  all  blood  counts 
(Chap. 470). 
SUPPORTIVE CARE
Meticulous  medical  attention  is  required  so  that  the  patient  may 
survive  to  benefit  from  definitive  therapy  or,  having  failed  treat-
ment, to maintain a reasonable existence in the face of pancytope-
nia. First and most important, infection in the presence of severe 
neutropenia must be aggressively treated by prompt institution of 
parenteral,  broad-spectrum  antibiotics.  Therapy  is  empirical  and 
must not await results of culture, although specific foci of infection 
such as oropharyngeal or anorectal abscesses, pneumonia, sinusitis, 
and  typhlitis  (necrotizing  colitis)  should  be  sought  on  physical 
examination and with radiographic studies. When indwelling plas-
tic catheters become contaminated, vancomycin should be added. 
Persistent  or  recrudescent  fever  implies  fungal  disease:  Candida 
and  Aspergillus  are  common,  especially  after  several  courses  of 
antibacterial antibiotics. A major reason for the improved prognosis 
in  aplastic  anemia  has  been  the  development  of  better  antifungal 
drugs and the timely institution of such therapy when infection is 
suspected.  Granulocyte  transfusions  can  be  effective  when  bacte-
rial  or  fungal  infection  is  progressive  or  refractory  to  antibiotics. 
Hand washing, the single best method of preventing the spread of 
infection, remains a neglected practice. Nonabsorbed antibiotics for 
gut decontamination are poorly tolerated and unproven, nor does 
reverse isolation reduce mortality from infections.

Both  platelet  and  erythrocyte  numbers  can  be  maintained  by 
transfusion.  Alloimmunization  historically  limited  the  usefulness 
of platelet transfusions and is now minimized by several strategies, 
including use of single donors to reduce exposure and physical or 
chemical  methods  to  diminish  leukocytes  in  the  product;  HLA-
matched platelets are usually effective in patients refractory to ran-
dom donor products. Inhibitors of fibrinolysis such as aminocaproic 
acid  have  not  been  shown  to  relieve  mucosal  oozing;  the  use  of 
low-dose glucocorticoids to induce “vascular stability” is unproven 
and not recommended. With prophylactic platelet transfusions, the

798

goal is to maintain the platelet count >10,000/μL (oozing from the 
gut  increases  sharply  at  counts  <5000/μL).  Menstruation  should 
be suppressed either by oral estrogens or nasal follicle-stimulating 
hormone/luteinizing hormone antagonists. Aspirin and other non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory agents must be avoided in the presence 
of thrombocytopenia.

RBCs should be transfused so as to allow patient a normal level 
of activity, usually at a hemoglobin value of 70 g/L (90 g/L if there 
is underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease); a regimen of 2 units 
every  2  weeks  will  replace  normal  losses  in  a  patient  without  a 
functioning  bone  marrow.  In  chronic  anemia,  the  iron  chelators 
deferoxamine and deferasirox should be added at approximately the 
fiftieth transfusion to avoid secondary hemochromatosis.

PURE RED CELL APLASIA
Other more restricted forms of marrow failure occur, in which only a 
single cell type is affected and the marrow shows corresponding absence 
or decreased numbers of specific precursor cells: aregenerative anemia 
as  in  PRCA  (see  below),  thrombocytopenia  with  amegakaryocytosis 
(Chap. 115), and neutropenia without marrow myeloid cells in agranu-
locytosis (Chap. 64). In general, and in contrast to aplastic anemia and 
MDS,  the  unaffected  lineages  appear  quantitatively  and  qualitatively 
normal. Agranulocytosis, the most frequent of these syndromes, is usu-
ally a complication of medical drug use, either by a mechanism of direct 
chemical  toxicity  or  by  immune  destruction.  Agranulocytosis  has  an 
incidence similar to aplastic anemia (but geographically more frequent 
in Europe than in Asia); in contrast to aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis 
is  more  prevalent  among  older  adults  and  in  women.  Agranulocyto-
sis  should  resolve  with  discontinuation  of  exposure,  but  significant 
mortality is attached to neutropenia in the older and often previously 
unwell  patient.  Both  pure  white  cell  aplasia  (agranulocytosis  without 
incriminating drug exposure) and amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia 
are exceedingly rare and, like PRCA, appear to be due to a destructive 
immune response. In all of the single-lineage failure syndromes, pro-
gression to pancytopenia or leukemia is unusual.

 ■ DEFINITION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
PRCA  is  characterized  by  anemia,  reticulocytopenia,  and  absent  or 
rare erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow. The classification of 
PRCA is shown in Table 102-4. In adults, PRCA is acquired. An iden-
tical syndrome can occur constitutionally: Diamond-Blackfan anemia, 
or congenital PRCA, is  diagnosed  at  birth  or in  early  childhood  and 
often  responds  to  glucocorticoid  treatment;  mutations  in  ribosome 
protein genes are etiologic. Temporary red cell failure occurs in tran-
sient aplastic crisis of hemolytic anemias due to acute parvovirus infec-
tion  (Chap.  197)  and  in  transient  erythroblastopenia  of  childhood, 
which occurs in normal children.

 ■ CLINICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND ETIOLOGY
PRCA  has  important  associations  with  immune  system  diseases.  A 
minority  of  cases  occur  with  a  thymoma.  More  frequently,  red  cell 
aplasia can be the major manifestation of large granular lymphocytosis 
or complicates chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Some patients may be 
hypogammaglobulinemic. A ribosomal protein gene is deleted in the 
5q- syndrome, such that the MDS may manifest as an acquired red cell 
aplasia. Occasionally (as compared to agranulocytosis), PRCA can be 
due  to  an  idiosyncratic  drug  reaction.  Subcutaneous  administration 
of  EPO  has  provoked  PRCA  mediated  by  neutralizing  antibodies 
to  the  hormone.  PRCA  due  to  antibodies  to  blood  group  antigens 
(isoagglutins)  is  a  complication  of  allogeneic  stem  cell  transplant. 
For most PRCAs, T-cell inhibition is probably the prevalent immune 
mechanism.

 ■ PERSISTENT PARVOVIRUS B19 INFECTION
Chronic  parvovirus  infection  is  a  treatable  cause  of  red  cell  aplasia. 
This  common  virus  causes  a  benign  exanthem  of  childhood  (fifth 
disease) and a polyarthralgia/arthritis syndrome in adults. In patients

with underlying hemolysis (or any condition that increases demand for 
RBC  production),  parvovirus  infection  can  cause  a  transient  aplastic 
crisis  and  an  abrupt  but  temporary  worsening  of  the  anemia  due  to 
failed erythropoiesis. In normal individuals, acute infection is resolved 
by production of neutralizing antibodies to the virus, but in the setting 
of  congenital,  acquired,  or  iatrogenic  immunodeficiency,  persistent 
viral  infection  may  occur.  The  bone  marrow  shows  red  cell  aplasia 
and  the  presence  of  giant  pronormoblasts  (Fig.  102-2),  which  is  the 
cytopathic sign of B19 parvovirus infection. Viral tropism for human 
erythroid progenitor cells is due to its use of erythrocyte P antigen as 
a cellular receptor for entry. Direct cytotoxicity of virus causes anemia 
if demands on erythrocyte production are high; in normal individuals, 
the temporary cessation of red cell production is not clinically appar-
ent, and skin and joint symptoms are mediated by immune complex 
deposition.

TREATMENT
Pure Red Cell Aplasia

History, physical examination, and routine laboratory studies may 
disclose  an  underlying  disease  or  a  drug  exposure.  Thymoma 
should  be  sought  by  radiographic  procedures;  tumor  excision  is 
indicated,  but  anemia  does  not  necessarily  improve  with  surgery. 
The  diagnosis  of  parvovirus  infection  requires  detection  of  viral 
DNA  sequences  in  the  blood  (IgG  and  IgM  antibodies  are  com-
monly  absent).  The  presence  of  erythroid  colonies  has  been  con-
sidered  predictive  of  response  to  immunosuppressive  therapy  in 
idiopathic PRCA.

Red  cell  aplasia  is  compatible  with  long-term  survival  with 
supportive  care  alone:  a  combination  of  erythrocyte  transfusions 
and iron chelation. For persistent B19 parvovirus infection, almost 
all  patients  respond  to  intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy.  The 
majority  of  patients  with  acquired  PRCA  respond  favorably  to 
immunosuppression: glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, ATG, azathio-
prine, and cyclophosphamide are effective.

clinical  outcomes  will  be  increasingly 
important  in  defining  classification, 
prognosis, and targeting therapy.

The  diagnosis  of  MDS  can  be  a 
challenge,  even  for  the  expert,  because 
sometimes subtle clinical and pathologic 
features must be distinguished, and pre-
cise  diagnostic  categorization  requires 
a  hematopathologist  knowledgeable  in 
the latest classification scheme. Unfortu-
nately, agreement among pathologists on 
morphologic  features  and  classification 
is  imperfect;  changes  in  the  appearance 
of megakaryocytes are more reliable than 
loss of granules in neutrophil precursors 
or  dyserythropoiesis.  Further,  dysplastic 
changes can be observed in normal indi-
viduals, and they can occur with vitamin 
deficiencies and as drug effects. Genomic 
testing  is  increasingly  routine  and  can 
be difficult to interpret, as in differences 
between  somatic  and  germline  muta-
tions, pathogenic mutations versus those 
of unknown significance (clonal hemato-
poiesis  increases  in  frequency  with  age 
and involves genetic changes that may be 
clinically  silent  or  convey  an  increased 
risk  of  hematologic  malignancy),  and 
clone  size  and  changes  over  time.  It  is 
important that the internist and primary 
care  physician  be  sufficiently  familiar 
with MDS to expedite referral to a hema-
tologist because many new therapies are 
now available to improve hematopoietic 
function  and  the  judicious  use  of  sup-
portive  care  can  improve  the  patient’s 
quality of life.

MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES
 ■ DEFINITION
The  MDS  are  a  heterogeneous  group  of  hematologic  disorders  char-
acterized by both (1) cytopenias due to bone marrow failure and (2) 
a  high  risk  of  development  of  AML.  Anemia  due  to  ineffective  ery-
thropoiesis,  often  with  thrombocytopenia  and  neutropenia,  occurs 
with  dysmorphic  (abnormal  appearing)  and  usually  cellular  bone 
marrow,  or  with  specific  chromosome  abnormalities  or  acquired 
mutations.  In  patients  with  “low-risk”  MDS,  marrow  failure  domi-
nates  the  clinical  course.  In  other  patients,  myeloblasts  are  present 
at  diagnosis,  chromosomes  are  abnormal,  and  the  “high  risk”  is  due 
to leukemic progression. MDS may be fatal due, most often, to com-
plications of pancytopenia or to progression to leukemia, but a large 
proportion of patients will die of concurrent disease, the comorbidities 
typical  in  an  elderly  population.  A  useful  nosology  of  these  often- 
confusing entities was first developed by the French-American-British 
Cooperative Group in 1983. Five subtypes were defined then: refrac-
tory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 
refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with 
excess  blasts  in  transformation  (RAEB-t),  and  chronic  myelomono-
cytic leukemia (CMML). The World Health Organization (WHO) clas-
sification (2002) recognized that the distinction between RAEB-t and 
AML was arbitrary, grouped them together as acute leukemia, and clar-
ified that CMML behaves as a myeloproliferative disease. The current 
WHO classification of 2016 is more refined but also more complicated  
(Table 102-5): blast percentage remains critical in defining MDS cat-
egories; erythroid predominant leukemias are now largely regarded as 
MDS; defining cytogenetic abnormalities are reaffirmed; and a single 
somatic mutation, in SF3B1, is now a feature of sideroblastic anemias. 
Identification of somatically mutated genes and their correlation with 

 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY
MDS  is  a  disease  of  the  elderly;  the  mean  age  at  onset  is  older  than  
70  years.  There  is  a  slight  male  predominance.  MDS  is  a  relatively 
common form of bone marrow failure, with reported incidence rates 
of 35 to >100 per million persons in the general population and 120 to 
>500 per million in older adults. Estimates of incidence in the United 
States range from 30,000 to 40,000 new cases annually and a prevalence 
of 60,000–120,000 in the population. Rates of MDS have increased over 
time due to better recognition of the syndrome by physicians and an 
aging population.

MDS  is  rare  in  children,  in  whom  it  often  has  a  constitutional 
genetic  basis  that  can  be  identified  on  genomic  screens  of  myeloid 
cancer predisposition panels.

Secondary or therapy-related MDS, usually related to previous iatro-
genic exposure to alkylating agents and other chemotherapy as well as 
radiation, is not age related.

 ■ ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
MDS is associated with environmental exposures such as radiation and 
benzene; other risk factors have been reported inconsistently. Second-
ary, therapy-related MDS occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment; 
radiation  and  the  radiomimetic  alkylating  agents  such  as  busulfan, 
nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5–7 years); or the 
DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (2-year latency). Acquired aplastic ane-
mia, Fanconi anemia, and other constitutional marrow failure diseases 
can evolve into MDS; occasionally, MDS in adults is recognized as due 
to germline GATA2, RUNX1, or telomere gene mutations. The typical 
MDS patient does not have a suggestive environmental exposure his-
tory  or  a  preceding  hematologic  disease.  MDS  is  a  disease  of  aging, 
consistent  with  accumulation  of  mutations  within  a  hematopoietic 
stem cell in an aging marrow environment.

MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by 
disordered  cell  proliferation,  impaired  differentiation,  and  aberrant 
hematopoiesis, resulting in cytopenias and risk of progression to leuke-
mia. Both chromosomal and genetic instability have been implicated; 
both are aging-related. Cytogenetic abnormalities are found in approx-
imately one-half of patients, and some of the same specific lesions are 
also seen in leukemia; aneuploidy (chromosome loss or gain) is more 
frequent than translocations. Accelerated telomere attrition may desta-
bilize the genome in marrow failure and predispose to acquisition of 
chromosomal lesions. Cytogenetic abnormalities are not random (loss 
of all or part of 5, 7, and 20, trisomy of 8) and may be related to etiology 
(11q23 following topoisomerase II inhibitors). The type and number 
of cytogenetic abnormalities strongly correlate with the probability of 
leukemic transformation and survival.

Genomics has illuminated the role of specific mutations and distinct 
molecular  pathways  in  the  pathophysiology  of  MDS.  Somatic  muta-
tions in about 100 genes, which are recurrently present in myeloid neo-
plasms and are acquired in about 100 genes, are arise in the abnormal 
marrow cells (and are absent in the germline). Many of the same genes 
are  mutated  in  AML  and  in  MDS,  whereas  others  are  distinctive  in 
subtypes of MDS. A prominent example is SF3B1, in which mutations 
strongly associate with sideroblastic anemia. Some mutations correlate 
with prognosis: spliceosome defects (like SF3B1) correlate with favor-
able outcome, and mutations in EZH2, TP53, RUNX1, and ASXL1 with 
poor outcome. Correlation and exclusion in the pattern of mutations 
indicate a functional genomic architecture. Driver genes mutated early 
are  consistent  with  normal  blood  counts  and  marrow  morphology, 
but these expanded clones of cells containing them are susceptible to 
malignant transformation with the acquisition of additional mutations. 
Deep sequencing results in patients whose MDS evolved to AML have 
shown  clonal  succession,  with  founder  clones  acquiring  additional 
mutations  to  produce  clonal  dominance.  Mutations  and  cytogenetic 
abnormalities  are  not  independent:  TP53  mutations  associate  with 
complex cytogenetic abnormalities and TET2 mutations with normal 
cytogenetics. The prevalence of abnormal cells by morphology under-
estimates  bone  marrow  involvement  by  MDS  clones,  as  cells  normal 
in appearance are derived from the abnormal clones. Presenting and 
evolving hematologic manifestations result from the accumulation of 
multiple  genetic  lesions:  loss  of  tumor-suppressor  genes,  activating 
oncogene, epigenetic pathways that affect mRNA processing and meth-
ylation status, or other harmful alterations. Pathophysiology has been 
linked to mutations and chromosome abnormalities in some specific 

MDS  syndromes.  The  5q–  deletion  leads  to  heterozygous  loss  of  a 
ribosomal  protein  gene  which  mimics  constitutional  red  cell  aplasia. 
An  immune  pathophysiology  may  be  important  in  lower  risk  MDS, 
as cytopenias can respond to immunosuppressive therapy as adminis-
tered for aplastic anemia. In general for MDS, the role of the immune 
system and its cells and cytokines; the role of the hematopoietic stem 
cell niche, the microenvironment, and cell–cell interactions; the fate of 
normal cells in the Darwinian competitive environment of the dysplas-
tic marrow; and how mutant cells produce marrow failure in MDS are 
still not completely understood.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Anemia dominates the early course. Most symptomatic patients com-
plain of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and pallor, 
but  at  least  one-half  of  patients  are  asymptomatic,  and  their  MDS  is 
discovered  only  incidentally  on  routine  blood  counts.  Previous  che-
motherapy  or  radiation  exposure  is  an  important  historic  fact.  Fever 
and weight loss are more often features of a myeloproliferative rather 
than  myelodysplastic  process.  MDS  in  childhood  is  rare  and,  when 
diagnosed,  implicates  an  underlying  genetic  disease.  Children  with 
Down syndrome are susceptible to MDS as well as leukemia. A family 
history may indicate a hereditary form of sideroblastic anemia, Fanconi 
anemia,  or  a  telomeropathy.  Inherited  GATA2  mutations,  as  in  the 
MonoMAC syndrome (with increased susceptibility to viral, mycobac-
terial, and fungal infections, as well as deficient numbers of monocytes, 
natural killer cells, and B lymphocytes), predispose to MDS. Germline 
RUNX1 mutations also confer a high risk of MDS and leukemia, often 
preceded  by  years  of  modest  thrombocytopenia.  A  family  history  is 
important  in  all  MDS  patients,  as  constitutional  mutations  may  not 
result in manifest disease until adulthood.

The physical examination in MDS is remarkable for signs of anemia; 
approximately 20% of patients have splenomegaly. Some unusual skin 
lesions, including Sweet’s syndrome (febrile neutrophilic dermatosis), 
occur  with  MDS.  Accompanying  autoimmune  syndromes  are  not 
infrequent. In the younger patient, stereotypical anomalies point to a 
constitutional  syndrome  (short  stature,  abnormal  thumbs  in  Fanconi 
anemia;  early  graying  in  the  telomeropathies;  cutaneous  warts  in 
GATA2 deficiency).
 ■ LABORATORY STUDIES
Blood  Anemia  is  present  in  most  cases,  either  alone  or  as  part  of 
bi-  or  pancytopenia;  isolated  neutropenia  or  thrombocytopenia  is

more  unusual.  Macrocytosis  is  common,  as  in  most  marrow  failure 
disease. Platelets also are large and lack granules. In functional studies, 
they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding 
symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are hypo-
granulated;  have  hyposegmented,  ringed,  or  abnormally  segmented 
nuclei;  contain  Döhle  bodies;  and  may  be  functionally  deficient. 
Circulating myeloblasts usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, 
and  their  quantity  is  important  for  classification  and  prognosis.  The 
total  white  blood  cell  count  (WBC)  is  usually  normal  or  low,  except 
in CMML. As in aplastic anemia, MDS can be associated with a clonal 
population of PNH cells. Genetic testing is commercially available for 
constitutional syndromes.

Bone Marrow  The bone marrow is usually normal or hypercellu-
lar, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to lead to 
confusion with aplastic anemia. No single characteristic feature of mar-
row morphology distinguishes MDS, but the following are commonly 
observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) 
and ringed sideroblasts in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and 
hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in mye-
loblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorga-
nized nuclei. Megaloblastic nuclei and defective hemoglobinization in 
the erythroid lineage are common. Prognosis strongly correlates with 
the proportion of marrow blasts, which should be enumerated manu-
ally on the marrow smear and by flow cytometry of an aspirate. Flow 
cytometry  can  also  reveal  characteristically  aberrant  hematopoietic 
differentiation. Cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization can 
identify chromosomal abnormalities.

 ■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate should be excluded by appropriate 
blood  tests;  vitamin  B6  deficiency  can  be  assessed  by  a  therapeutic  
trial  of  pyridoxine  if  the  bone  marrow  shows  ringed  sideroblasts. 
Copper  deficiency  can  lead  to  cytopenias  and  dysplastic  marrows  of 
varying  cellularity.  Marrow  dysplasia  can  be  observed  in  acute  viral 
infections,  drug  reactions,  or  chemical  toxicity  but  should  be  tran-
sient.  More  difficult  are  the  distinctions  between  hypocellular  MDS 
and aplasia or between RA with excess blasts and acute leukemia: the 
WHO  considers  20%  blasts  in  the  marrow  as  the  criterion  that  sep-
arates  AML  from  MDS.  In  young  patients,  underlying,  predisposing 
genetic diseases should be considered and appropriate genomic testing 
performed (see above).

 ■ PROGNOSIS
The median survival varies greatly from years for patients with 5q– or 
sideroblastic anemia to a few months in RA with excess blasts or severe 
pancytopenia  associated  with  monosomy  7.  The  International  Prog-
nostic Scoring System (IPSS), revised in 2012 (Table 102-6), assists in 
making predictions. Even “lower-risk” MDS has significant morbidity 
and  mortality.  More  refined  (and  also  more  complicated)  prognostic

scoring systems can separate those with intermediate-1 risk who have 
relatively  poor  prognoses.  Prognostic  systems  have  been  developed 
based  on  survival  from  diagnosis,  but  prognosis  changes  over  time, 
and hazard ratios for survival and leukemic transformation converge 
over time among risk categories, consistent with dynamic changes in 
clonal architecture.

Most patients die as a result of complications of pancytopenia and 
not due to leukemic transformation; perhaps one-third succumb to dis-
eases unrelated to their MDS. Precipitous worsening of pancytopenia, 
acquisition  of  new  chromosomal  abnormalities  on  serial  cytogenetic 
determination, increase in the number of blasts, and marrow fibrosis 
are  all  poor  prognostic  indicators.  The  outlook  in  therapy-related 
MDS, regardless of type, is extremely poor, and most patients progress 
within a few months to refractory AML.

Historically,  therapy  of  MDS  has  been  unsatisfactory,  but  several 
drugs may not only improve blood counts but also delay onset of 
leukemia and improve survival. The choice of therapy for an indi-
vidual  patient,  administration  of  treatment,  and  management  of 
toxicities are complicated and require hematologic expertise.

Only  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  offers  cure  of 
MDS.  The  survival  rate  in  selected  patient  cohorts  is  ~50%  at   
3  years  but  improving.  Results  using  unrelated  matched  donors 
are similar to those with siblings, and patients in their fifties and 
older have been successfully transplanted. Nevertheless, treatment- 
related  mortality  and  morbidity  increase  with  recipient  age.  The 
transplant conundrum is that the high-risk patient (by IPSS score 
and presence of monosomal karyotype), for whom the procedure is 
most obviously indicated, has a high probability of a poor outcome 
from  transplant-related  mortality  or  disease  relapse,  whereas  the 
low-risk patient, who is more likely to tolerate transplant, also may 
do well for years with less aggressive therapies. In practice, only a 
small proportion of MDS patients undergo transplantation.

MDS  has  been  regarded  as  particularly  refractory  to  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  regimens,  and  as  in  AML  in  the  older  adult,  drug 
toxicity is frequent and often fatal, and remissions, if achieved, are 
brief. Low doses of cytotoxic drugs have been administered for their 
“differentiation”  potential,  and  from  this  experience,  drug  thera-
pies  have  emerged  based  on  pyrimidine  analogues.  These  drugs 
are  classified  as  epigenetic  modulators,  believed  to  act  through 
a  demethylating  mechanism  to  alter  gene  regulation  and  allow 
differentiation  to  mature  blood  cells  from  the  abnormal  MDS 
stem  cell.  The  hypomethylating  agents  azacitidine  and  decitabine 
are  frequently  used  in  bone  marrow  failure  clinics.  Azacitidine 
improves blood counts and survival in MDS, compared to best sup-
portive  care.  Azacitidine  is  usually  administered  subcutaneously, 
daily for 7 days, at 4-week intervals, for at least four cycles before 
assessing  for  response.  Overall,  generally  improved  blood  counts 
with a decrease in transfusion requirements occurred in ~50% of 
patients  in  published  trials.  Response  is  dependent  on  continued 
drug administration, and most patients eventually become refrac-
tory  to  drug  intervention  and  experience  recurrent  cytopenias  or 
progression  to  AML.  Decitabine  is  closely  related  to  azacitidine; 
30–50% of patients show responses in blood counts, with a duration 
of response of almost a year. Decitabine is usually administered by 
continuous intravenous infusion in regimens of varying doses and 
durations  of  3–10  days  in  repeating  cycles.  The  major  toxicity  of 
azacitidine and decitabine is myelosuppression, leading to worsen-
ing  blood  counts.  Hypomethylating  agents  are  frequently  used  in 
the high-risk patient who is not a candidate for stem cell transplant. 
In the lower risk patient, they are also effective, but alternative ther-
apies should be considered.

Lenalidomide,  a  thalidomide  derivative  with  a  more  favorable 
toxicity profile, is particularly effective in reversing anemia in MDS 
patients with 5q– syndrome; not only do a high proportion of these

802

patients  become  transfusion  independent  with  normal  or  near- 
normal hemoglobin levels, but their cytogenetics also become nor-
mal. The drug has many biologic activities, and it is unclear which 
is critical for clinical efficacy. Lenalidomide is administered orally. 
Most  patients  will  improve  within  3  months  of  initiating  therapy. 
Toxicities include myelosuppression (worsening thrombocytopenia 
and  neutropenia,  necessitating  blood  count  monitoring)  and  an 
increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Immunosuppression also may produce sustained independence 
from  transfusion  and  improve  survival.  ATG,  cyclosporine,  and 
the  anti-CD52  monoclonal  antibody  alemtuzumab  are  especially 
effective  in  younger  MDS  patients  (<60  years  old)  with  more 
favorable IPSS. In a consortium retrospective review, about 50% of 
patients with mainly refractory anemia responded to ATG, usually 
combined with cyclosporine, particularly patients with hypocellular 
marrow.

HGFs can improve blood counts but, as in most other marrow 
failure  states,  have  been  most  beneficial  to  patients  with  the  least 
severe  pancytopenia.  EPO  alone  or  in  combination  with  G-CSF 
can  improve  hemoglobin  levels,  particularly  in  those  with  low 
serum EPO levels who have no or a modest need for transfusions. 
Survival  may  be  enhanced  by  EPO  and  amelioration  of  anemia. 
G-CSF  treatment  alone  failed  to  improve  survival  in  a  controlled 
trial. Thrombopoietin mimetics appear to improve platelet counts 
in some MDS patients, with no clear evidence that they increase the 
rate of leukemic transformation.

New drugs for MDS are entering the clinic or are in late devel-
opment. Luspatercept, which affects transforming growth factor β–
mediated suppression of erythropoiesis, has been approved by the 
FDA for anemia in MDS. Novel targeted therapies in trials include 
inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor and spliceosome genes, drugs 
that act to restore TP53 activity, and venetoclax, an inhibitor of the 
bcl2 protein that increases programmed cell death (and is approved 
for use or employed off-label in other hematologic malignancies).

The  same  principles  of  supportive  care  described  for  aplastic 
anemia apply to MDS. Many patients will be anemic for years. RBC 
transfusion  support  should  be  accompanied  by  iron  chelation  to 
prevent secondary hemochromatosis.

MYELOPHTHISIC ANEMIAS
Fibrosis of the bone marrow (see Fig. 100-2), usually accompanied by 
a  characteristic  blood  smear  picture  called  leukoerythroblastosis,  can 
occur as a primary hematologic disease, called myelofibrosis or myeloid 
metaplasia  (Chap. 103),  and  as  a  secondary  process,  called  myeloph-
thisis.  Myelophthisis,  or  secondary  myelofibrosis,  is  reactive.  Fibrosis 
can be a response to invading tumor cells, usually an epithelial cancer 
of breast, lung, or prostate origin or neuroblastoma. Marrow fibrosis 
may occur with infection of mycobacteria (both Mycobacterium tuber-
culosis and Mycobacterium avium), fungi, or HIV and in sarcoidosis. 
Intracellular lipid deposition in Gaucher disease and obliteration of the 
marrow space related to absence of osteoclast remodeling in congenital 
osteopetrosis  also  can  produce  fibrosis.  Secondary  myelofibrosis  is  a 
late consequence of radiation therapy or treatment with radiomimetic 
drugs.  Usually  the  infectious  or  malignant  underlying  processes  are 
obvious. Marrow fibrosis can also be a feature of a variety of hemato-
logic syndromes, especially chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple mye-
loma, lymphomas, myeloma, and hairy cell leukemia.

The  pathophysiology  has  three  distinct  features:  proliferation  of 
fibroblasts  in  the  marrow  space  (myelofibrosis);  the  extension  of 
hematopoiesis  into  the  long  bones  and  into  extramedullary  sites, 
usually the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes (myeloid metaplasia); and 
ineffective  erythropoiesis.  The  etiology  of  the  fibrosis  is  unknown 
but  most  likely  involves  dysregulated  production  of  growth  factors:  
platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor β have 
been implicated. Abnormal regulation of other hematopoietins would 
lead  to  localization  of  blood-producing  cells  in  nonhematopoietic 
tissues  and  uncoupling  of  the  usually  balanced  processes  of  stem 
cell  proliferation  and  differentiation.  Myelofibrosis  is  remarkable  for 

pancytopenia despite very large numbers of circulating hematopoietic 
progenitor cells.

Anemia is dominant in secondary myelofibrosis, usually normocytic 
and  normochromic.  The  diagnosis  is  suggested  by  the  characteristic 
leukoerythroblastic  smear  (see  Fig.  100-1).  Erythrocyte  morphology 
is  highly  abnormal,  with  circulating  nucleated  RBCs,  teardrops,  and 
shape distortions. WBC numbers are often elevated, sometimes mim-
icking  a  leukemoid  reaction,  with  circulating  myelocytes,  promyelo-
cytes, and myeloblasts. Platelets may be abundant and are often of giant 
size. Inability to aspirate the bone marrow, the characteristic “dry tap,” 
can allow a presumptive diagnosis in the appropriate setting before the 
biopsy is decalcified.

The course of secondary myelofibrosis is determined by its etiology, 
usually  a  metastatic  tumor  or  an  advanced  hematologic  malignancy. 
Treatable causes must be excluded, especially tuberculosis and fungus. 
Transfusion support can relieve symptoms.

103 Polycythemia Vera and  
Other Myeloproliferative 
Neoplasms
Jerry L. Spivak

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of the chronic 
myeloproliferative  neoplasms  (MPNs)  includes  eight  disorders,  some 
of which are rare or poorly characterized (Table 103-1) but all of which 
share an origin in a hematopoietic cell; overproduction of one or more 
of the formed elements of the blood without significant dysplasia; and 
a  predilection  to  extramedullary  hematopoiesis,  myelofibrosis,  and 
transformation at varying rates to acute leukemia. Within this broad 
classification,  however,  significant  phenotypic  heterogeneity  exists. 
Some diseases such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic 
neutrophilic  leukemia  (CNL),  and  chronic  eosinophilic  leukemia 
(CEL)  express  primarily  a  myeloid  phenotype,  whereas  in  other  dis-
eases, such as polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 
and  essential  thrombocytosis  (ET),  erythroid  or  megakaryocytic

Myeloproliferative neoplasms, unclassifiable

hyperplasia  predominates.  The  latter  three  disorders,  in  contrast  to 
the former three, also appear capable of transforming into each other.
Such phenotypic heterogeneity has a genetic basis; CML is the con-
sequence of the balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 
(t[9;22][q34;11]); CNL has been associated with a t(15;19) transloca-
tion; and CEL occurs with a deletion or balanced translocations involv-
ing the PDGFRα gene. By contrast, PV, PMF, and ET are characterized 
by  driver  mutations  that  directly  or  indirectly  constitutively  activate 
JAK2, a tyrosine kinase essential for the function of the erythropoietin 
and  thrombopoietin  receptors  and  also  utilized  by  the  granulocyte  
colony-stimulating  factor  receptor.  This  important  distinction  is 
reflected  in  the  natural  histories  of  CML,  CNL,  and  CEL,  which  are 
usually measured in years, with a high rate of leukemic transformation. 
The natural histories of PV, PMF, and ET, by contrast, are usually mea-
sured in decades, and transformation to acute leukemia is uncommon 
in the absence of chemotherapy. This chapter focuses only on PV, PMF, 
and ET because their clinical features and driver mutation overlap are 
substantial, although their disease duration varies.

The other chronic MPNs will be discussed in Chaps. 105 and 110.

POLYCYTHEMIA VERA
PV  is  a  clonal  hematopoietic  stem  cell  disorder  in  which  phenotypi-
cally  normal  red  cells,  granulocytes,  and  platelets  accumulate  in  the 
absence of a recognizable physiologic stimulus. The most common of 
the MPNs, PV occurs in 2.5 per 100,000 persons, sparing no adult age 
group  and  increasing  with  age  to  rates  >10/100,000.  Familial  trans-
mission is infrequent, and women under age 50 predominate among 
sporadic cases.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
Nonrandom  chromosome  abnormalities  such  as  deletion  20q  and 
deletion 13q or trisomy 9 occur in up to 30% of untreated PV patients, 
but unlike CML, no consistent cytogenetic abnormality has been asso-
ciated  with  the  disorder.  However,  a  mutation  in  the  autoinhibitory 
pseudokinase domain of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 that replaces valine 
with phenylalanine (V617F), causing constitutive kinase activation, has 
a central role in PV pathogenesis.

JAK2 is a member of an evolutionarily well-conserved, nonreceptor 
tyrosine  kinase  family  and  serves  as  the  cognate  tyrosine  kinase  for 
the erythropoietin and thrombopoietin receptors. It also functions as 
an obligate chaperone for these receptors in the Golgi apparatus and 
is  responsible  for  their  cell-surface  expression.  The  conformational 
change  induced  in  the  erythropoietin  and  thrombopoietin  receptors 
following  binding  to  their  respective  cognate  ligands,  erythropoietin 
or  thrombopoietin,  leads  to  JAK2  autophosphorylation,  receptor 
phosphorylation,  and  phosphorylation  of  proteins  involved  in  cell 
proliferation,  differentiation,  and  resistance  to  apoptosis.  Transgenic 
animals lacking JAK2 die as embryos from severe anemia. Constitutive 
activation  of  JAK2,  on  the  other  hand,  explains  the  erythropoietin 
hypersensitivity, erythropoietin-independent erythroid colony forma-
tion,  rapid  terminal  differentiation,  increased  Bcl-XL  expression,  and 
apoptosis resistance in the absence of erythropoietin that characterize 
the in vitro behavior of PV erythroid progenitor cells.

More  than  95%  of  PV  patients  express  this  mutation,  as  do ∼50% 
of  PMF  and  ET  patients.  Importantly,  the  JAK2  gene  is  located  on

the short arm of chromosome 9, and loss of heterozygosity on chro-
mosome  9p  involving  the  segment  containing  the  JAK2  locus  over 
time  due  to  mitotic  recombination  (uniparental  disomy)  is  the  most 
common cytogenetic abnormality in PV. Loss of heterozygosity in this 
region leads to homozygosity for JAK2 V617F and occurs in ∼60% of 
PV patients and to a lesser extent in PMF but is rare in ET. Most PV 
patients who do not express JAK2 V617F express a mutation in exon 12 
of the gene and are not clinically different from those who do, with the 
exception of a higher frequency of isolated erythrocytosis, nor do JAK2 
V617F heterozygotes differ clinically from homozygotes. Importantly, 
the predisposition to acquire JAK2 mutations appears to be associated 
with a specific JAK2 gene haplotype, GGCC. JAK2 V617F is the basis 
for many of the phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of PV such 
as increased blood cell production and increased inflammatory cytok-
ine  production;  however,  it  cannot  solely  account  for  the  entire  PV 
phenotype and is probably not the initiating lesion in any of the MPNs. 
First,  PV  patients  with  the  same  phenotype  and  documented  clonal 
disease can have mutations in LNK, a JAK2 inhibitor, or rarely, calre-
ticulin (CALR), an ER chaperone. Second, ET and PMF patients have 
the same mutation but different clinical phenotypes. Third, familial PV 
can occur without the mutation, even when other members of the same 
family express it. Fourth, inhibition of JAK2 V617F–expressing hemato-
poietic  progenitor  cells  by  the  nonspecific  JAK1/2  kinase  inhibitor, 
ruxolitinib, does not affect the behavior of the involved hematopoietic 
stem  cells.  Finally,  in  some  JAK2  V617F–positive  PV  or  ET  patients, 
acute  leukemia  can  occur  in  a  JAK2  V617F–negative  progenitor  cell, 
suggesting the presence of an ancestral precursor cell.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Although  PV  is  a  panmyelopathy,  isolated  thrombocytosis,  leukocy-
tosis, or splenomegaly may be its initial presenting manifestation, but 
most often, the disorder is first recognized by the incidental discovery 
of a high hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red cell count. With the exception 
of aquagenic pruritus, or erythromelalgia, no symptoms distinguish PV 
from other causes of erythrocytosis.

Uncontrolled erythrocytosis causes hyperviscosity, leading to neu-
rologic  symptoms  such  as  vertigo,  tinnitus,  headache,  visual  distur-
bances, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Systolic hypertension is 
also a feature of the red cell mass elevation. In some patients, venous 
or arterial thrombosis may be the presenting manifestation of PV. Any 
vessel can be affected, but cerebral, cardiac, and mesenteric vessels are 
most  commonly  involved.  Hepatic  venous  thrombosis  (Budd-Chiari 
syndrome) is particularly common in young women and may be cata-
strophic if sudden and complete obstruction of the hepatic vein occurs. 
Indeed, PV should be suspected in any patient who develops hepatic 
vein  thrombosis,  since  this  is  the  only  type  of  thrombosis  associated 
with JAK2 V617F expression. Digital ischemia, easy bruising, epistaxis, 
acid-peptic disease, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occur due to 
vascular stasis or thrombocytosis. In the latter instance, absorption and 
proteolysis of high-molecular-weight von Willebrand multimers by the 
large platelet mass cause acquired von Willebrand’s disease. Erythema, 
burning,  and  pain  in  the  extremities,  a  symptom  complex  known  as 
erythromelalgia, is another complication of thrombocytosis in PV due 
to  increased  platelet  stickiness.  Given  the  large  turnover  of  hemato-
poietic cells, hyperuricemia with secondary gout, uric acid stones, and 
symptoms due to hypermetabolism can also complicate the disorder.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
When PV presents with erythrocytosis in combination with leukocyto-
sis, thrombocytosis, or splenomegaly or any combination of these, the 
diagnosis is apparent. However, when patients present with an elevated 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red cell count alone, the diagnostic eval-
uation  is  more  complex  because  of  the  many  diagnostic  possibilities 
(Table 103-2). Furthermore, unless the hemoglobin level is ≥20 g/dL 
(hematocrit ≥60%), it is not possible to distinguish true erythrocytosis 
from  disorders  causing  plasma  volume  contraction.  This  is  because 
uniquely  in  PV,  in  contrast  to  other  causes  of  true  erythrocytosis, 
there is expansion of the plasma volume, which can mask the elevated 
red cell mass, particularly in women; thus, red cell mass and plasma

volume  determinations  are  necessary  to  establish  the  presence  of  an 
absolute erythrocytosis and distinguish this from relative erythrocyto-
sis due to a reduction in plasma volume alone (also known as stress or 
spurious erythrocytosis or Gaisböck’s syndrome). Figure 63-18 illustrates 
a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of suspected erythrocytosis. 
Assay for JAK2 mutations in the presence of a normal arterial oxygen 
saturation  provides  an  alternative  diagnostic  approach  to  erythrocy-
tosis  when  red  cell  mass  and  plasma  volume  determinations  are  not 
available;  a  normal  serum  erythropoietin  level  does  not  exclude  the 
presence of PV, but an elevated erythropoietin level is more consistent 
with a secondary cause for the erythrocytosis.

Other laboratory studies that may aid in diagnosis include the red 
cell count, mean corpuscular volume, and red cell distribution width 
(RDW), particularly when the hematocrit or hemoglobin levels are less 
than 60% or 20 g/dL, respectively. Only three situations cause micro-
cytic  erythrocytosis:  β-thalassemia  trait,  hypoxic  erythrocytosis,  and 
PV. With β-thalassemia trait, the RDW is usually normal, whereas with 
hypoxic erythrocytosis and PV, the RDW may be elevated due to asso-
ciated iron deficiency. Today, however, the assay for JAK2 V617F has 
superseded other tests for establishing the diagnosis of PV. Of course, 
in patients with associated acid-peptic disease, occult gastrointestinal 
bleeding  may  lead  to  a  presentation  with  hypochromic,  microcytic 
anemia, masking the presence of PV.

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy provide no specific diagnostic 
information  because  these  may  be  normal  or  indistinguishable  from 
ET or PMF. Similarly, no specific cytogenetic abnormality is associated 
with  the  disease,  and  the  absence  of  a  cytogenetic  marker  does  not 
exclude the diagnosis.
 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Many of the clinical complications of PV relate directly to the increase 
in blood viscosity associated with red cell mass elevation and indirectly 
to the increased turnover of red cells, leukocytes, and platelets with the 
attendant increase in uric acid and inflammatory cytokine production. 
The latter appears to be responsible for constitutional symptoms. Pep-
tic  ulcer  disease  can  also  be  due  to  Helicobacter  pylori  infection,  the 
incidence  of  which  is  increased  in  PV,  while  the  pruritus  associated 
with  this  disorder  may  be  a  consequence  of  mast  cell  activation  by 
JAK2 V617F. A sudden increase in spleen size can be associated with 

painful splenic infarction. Myelofibrosis appears to be part of the nat-
ural history of the disease but is a reactive, reversible process that does 
not itself impede hematopoiesis and by itself has no prognostic signif-
icance. In ∼15% of patients, however, myelofibrosis is associated with 
hematopoietic stem cell failure, manifested by substantial extramedul-
lary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen and transfusion-dependent 
anemia. The organomegaly can cause significant mechanical discom-
fort, portal hypertension, and progressive cachexia. Although the inci-
dence of acute myeloid leukemia is increased in PV, the incidence of 
acute leukemia in patients not exposed to chemotherapy or radiation 
therapy  is  low.  Interestingly,  chemotherapy,  including  hydroxyurea, 
has been associated with acute leukemia in JAK2 V617F–negative stem 
cells  in  some  PV  patients.  Erythromelalgia  is  a  curious  syndrome  of 
unknown etiology associated with thrombocytosis, primarily involving 
the  lower  extremities  and  usually  manifested  by  erythema,  warmth, 
and  pain  of  the  affected  appendage  and  occasionally  digital  infarc-
tion. It occurs with a variable frequency and is usually responsive to 
salicylates. Some of the central nervous system symptoms observed in 
patients with PV, such as ocular migraine, appear to represent a variant 
of erythromelalgia.

Left uncontrolled, erythrocytosis can lead to thrombosis involving 
vital organs such as the liver, heart, brain, or lungs. Patients with mas-
sive splenomegaly are particularly prone to thrombotic events because 
the associated increase in plasma volume masks the true extent of the 
red  cell  mass  elevation  measured  by  the  hematocrit  or  hemoglobin 
level. A “normal” hematocrit or hemoglobin level in a PV patient with 
massive splenomegaly should be considered indicative of an elevated 
red cell mass until proven otherwise.

TREATMENT
Polycythemia Vera

PV is generally an indolent disorder, the clinical course of which is 
measured in decades, and its management should reflect its tempo. 
Thrombosis  due  to  erythrocytosis  is  the  most  significant  compli-
cation and often the presenting manifestation; maintenance of the 
hemoglobin level at ≤140 g/L (14 g/dL; hematocrit <45%) in men 
and ≤120 g/L (12 g/dL; hematocrit <42%) in women is mandatory 
to  avoid  thrombotic  complications.  Phlebotomy  serves  initially 
to  reduce  hyperviscosity  by  reducing  the  red  cell  mass  to  normal 
while further expanding the plasma volume. Periodic phlebotomies 
thereafter  serve  to  maintain  the  red  cell  mass  within  the  normal 
range and induce a state of iron deficiency that prevents accelerated 
reexpansion  of  the  red  cell  mass.  In  most  PV  patients,  once  an 
iron-deficient state is achieved, phlebotomy is usually only required 
at  3-month  intervals.  Neither  phlebotomy  nor  iron  deficiency 
increases the platelet count relative to the effect of the disease itself, 
and  neither  thrombocytosis  nor  leukocytosis  is  correlated  with 
thrombosis  in  PV,  in  contrast  to  the  strong  correlation  between 
erythrocytosis  and  thrombosis.  The  use  of  salicylates  to  prevent 
thrombosis  in  PV  patients  is  not  only  potentially  harmful  if  the 
red cell mass is not controlled by phlebotomy but also an unproven 
remedy, particularly in patients over age 70.

Anticoagulation  is  indicated  when  a  thrombosis  has  occurred, 
and  the  newer  oral  anticoagulants  may  be  preferable  to  a  vitamin 
K antagonist since they do not require monitoring. Asymptomatic 
hyperuricemia  (<10  mg/dL)  requires  no  therapy,  but  allopurinol 
should be administered to avoid further elevation of the uric acid 
when chemotherapy is used to reduce splenomegaly or leukocytosis 
or  to  treat  pruritus.  Generalized  pruritus  intractable  to  antihista-
mines or antidepressants such as doxepin can be a major problem in 
PV; the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, pegylated interferon α (IFN-α), 
psoralens with ultraviolet light in the A range (PUVA) therapy, and 
hydroxyurea are other methods of palliation. Asymptomatic throm-
bocytosis requires no therapy unless the platelet count is sufficiently 
high  to  cause  bleeding  due  to  acquired  von  Willebrand’s  disease, 
but  bleeding  in  this  situation  is  not  usually  spontaneous  and  is 
responsive to tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid. Symptomatic

splenomegaly  can  be  treated  with  either  ruxolitinib  or  pegylated 
IFN-α. Pegylated IFN-α has the advantage over recombinant IFN-α 
of being better tolerated and requiring only weekly administration 
and produced complete hematologic and molecular remissions in 
∼20%  of  PV  patients;  its  role  in  this  disorder  is  currently  under 
investigation. Anagrelide, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, can reduce 
the  platelet  count  and,  if  tolerated,  is  preferable  to  hydroxyurea 
because  it  lacks  marrow  toxicity  and  is  also  protective  against 
venous thrombosis while hydroxyurea is not.

A reduction in platelet number may be necessary for the treat-
ment  of  erythromelalgia  or  ocular  migraine  if  salicylates  are  not 
effective or if the platelet count is sufficiently high to increase the 
risk of hemorrhage but only to the degree that symptoms are allevi-
ated. Alkylating agents and radioactive sodium phosphate (32P) are 
leukemogenic in PV, and their use should be avoided. If a cytotoxic 
agent must be used, hydroxyurea is preferred, but this drug does not 
prevent either thrombosis or myelofibrosis in PV, is itself leukemo-
genic, and should be used for as short a time as possible. Previously, 
PV patients with massive splenomegaly unresponsive to reduction 
by  chemotherapy  or  interferon  required  splenectomy.  However, 
with the introduction of the nonspecific JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, 
it has been possible in the majority of patients with PV complicated 
by myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia to reduce spleen size while 
at the same time alleviating constitutional symptoms and pruritus 
due to cytokine release and reducing the phlebotomy requirement. 
However,  in  contrast  to  PMF,  these  patients  have  a  more  chronic 
course. In contrast to other malignancies, PV patients have a low 
rate  of  mutation  accumulation,  and  the  acquisition  of  deleterious 
mutations such as TP53 mutations as detected by next-generation 
sequencing  is  usually  associated  with  leukemic  transformation. 
Since hydroxyurea antagonizes TP53 and also causes del17p, lead-
ing to TP53 haploinsufficiency, its use should be constrained in PV.
Ruxolitinib  has  also  been  demonstrated  in  a  phase  3  clinical 
trial  to  be  effective  in  PV  patients  without  myelofibrosis  who  are 
intolerant or refractory to hydroxyurea or best available supportive 
therapy. In some patients with end-stage disease, pulmonary hyper-
tension may develop due to fibrosis or extramedullary hematopoie-
sis.  A  role  for  bone  marrow  transplantation,  either  allogeneic  or 
haploidentical, in PV has not been defined.

Most  patients  with  PV  can  live  long  lives  without  functional 
impairment  when  their  red  cell  mass  is  effectively  managed  with 
phlebotomy alone. Chemotherapy is never indicated to control the 
red cell mass in PV, but when venous access is an issue, ruxolitinib 
or pegylated interferon is the preferred therapy.

 ■ PRIMARY MYELOFIBROSIS
Chronic  PMF  (other  designations  include  idiopathic  myelofibrosis, 
agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia) 
is  a  clonal  hematopoietic  stem  cell  disorder  associated  with  muta-
tions  in  JAK2,  MPL,  or  CALR  and  characterized  by  marrow  fibrosis, 
extramedullary  hematopoiesis,  and  splenomegaly.  PMF  is  the  least 
common MPN, and establishing its diagnosis in the absence of a spe-
cific clonal marker is difficult because myelofibrosis and splenomegaly 
are also features of both PV and CML. Furthermore, myelofibrosis and 
splenomegaly also occur in a variety of benign and malignant disorders 
(Table 103-3), many of which are amenable to specific therapies not 
effective in PMF. In contrast to the other MPNs and so-called acute or 
malignant myelofibrosis, which can occur at any age, PMF primarily 
afflicts men in their sixth decade or later.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
Nonrandom  chromosome  abnormalities  such  as  9p,  20q−,  13q−, 
trisomy  8  or  9,  or  partial  trisomy  1q  are  common  in  PMF,  but  no 
cytogenetic  abnormality  specific  to  the  disease  has  been  identified. 
JAK2  V617F  is  present  in  ∼55%  of  PMF  patients,  and  mutations  in 
the  thrombopoietin  receptor,  MPL,  occur  in  ~4%.  Most  of  the  rest 
have mutations in the calreticulin gene (CALR) that alter the carboxy- 
terminal portion of the protein, permitting it to bind and activate MPL.

The degree of myelofibrosis and the extent of extramedullary hemato-
poiesis  are  not  related.  Fibrosis  in  this  disorder  is  associated  with 
overproduction of transforming growth factor β and tissue inhibitors 
of metalloproteinases, while osteosclerosis is associated with overpro-
duction of osteoprotegerin, an osteoclast inhibitor. Marrow angiogen-
esis occurs due to increased production of vascular endothelial growth 
factor. Importantly, fibroblasts in PMF are polyclonal and not part of 
the neoplastic clone but can be induced by it to produce inflammatory 
cytokines.
 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
No signs or symptoms are specific for PMF. Many patients are asymp-
tomatic  at  presentation,  and  the  disease  is  often  detected  by  the  dis-
covery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a 
routine examination. In contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, 
fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood 
smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hemato-
poiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and 
promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 103-1). Anemia, 
usually mild initially, is common, whereas the leukocyte and platelet 
counts  are  either  normal  or  increased,  but  either  can  be  depressed. 
Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in 
its absence; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagno-
sis. Both serum lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels 
can be elevated. Marrow is usually inaspirable due to the myelofibrosis 
(Fig.  103-2),  and  bone  x-rays  may  reveal  osteosclerosis.  Exuberant 
extramedullary hematopoiesis can cause ascites; portal, pulmonary, or

Note: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) was developed 
to determine if the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk factors 
identified as important for survival at the time of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) 
diagnosis could also be used for risk stratification following their acquisition 
during the course of the disease. One point is assigned to each risk factor for 
IPSS scoring. For DIPSS, the same is true, but anemia is assigned 2 points. The 
DIPSS Plus scoring system represents recognition that the addition of unfavorable 
karyotype, thrombocytopenia, and transfusion dependence improved the DIPSS 
risk stratification system for which additional points are assigned (Table 103-5). 
More recent studies suggest that mutational analysis of the ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, 
and IDH1/2 genes further improves risk stratification for survival and leukemic 
transformation (Leukemia 27:1861, 2013), as can cytogenetic abnormalities 
(Leukemia 32:1631, 2018). These prognostic scoring systems are not accurate for risk 
assessment in polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytosis patients who have 
developed myelofibrosis (Haematologica 99:e55, 2014).

found in a majority of patients with PMF who lack mutations in either 
JAK2 or MPL. In some studies, type 1 mutations, the most common 
CALR mutation in PMF, had a survival advantage compared to JAK2 
or  MPL  mutations  but  not  with  respect  to  leukemic  transformation. 
PMF patients who lack a known MPN driver mutation appear to have 
the worst prognosis.

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Survival in PMF varies according to specific risk factors at diagnosis 
(Tables 103-4 and 103-5) but is shorter than in PV and ET patients. 
The natural history of PMF is one of increasing marrow failure with 
transfusion-dependent  anemia  and  increasing  organomegaly  due  to 
extramedullary  hematopoiesis.  As  with  CML,  PMF  can  evolve  from 
a  chronic  to  an  accelerated  phase  with  constitutional  symptoms  and 
increasing  marrow  failure.  About  10%  of  patients  spontaneously 
transform to an aggressive form of acute leukemia for which therapy is 
usually ineffective. Additional important prognostic factors for disease 
acceleration  during  the  course  of  PMF  include  the  presence  of  com-
plex  cytogenetic  abnormalities,  thrombocytopenia,  and  transfusion- 
dependent  anemia.  Mutations  in  the  ASXL1,  EZH2,  SRSF2,  and 
IDH1/2  genes  have  been  identified  as  risk  factors  for  early  death  or 
transformation to acute leukemia, as have complex cytogenetic abnor-
malities, and have proved to be more useful for PMF risk assessment 
than clinical scoring systems.

intracranial hypertension; intestinal or ureteral obstruction; pericardial 
tamponade; spinal cord compression; or skin nodules. Splenic enlarge-
ment can be sufficiently rapid to cause splenic infarction with fever and 
pleuritic chest pain. Hyperuricemia and secondary gout may ensue.
 ■ DIAGNOSIS
While  the  clinical  picture  described  above  is  characteristic  of  PMF, 
all of these clinical features can be observed in PV or CML. Massive 
splenomegaly  commonly  masks  erythrocytosis  in  PV,  and  reports  of 
intraabdominal thrombosis in PMF most likely represent instances of 
unrecognized PV. In some PMF patients, erythrocytosis has developed 
during  the  course  of  the  disease.  Furthermore,  because  many  other 
disorders have features that overlap with PMF but respond to distinctly 
different  therapies,  the  diagnosis  of  PMF  is  one  of  exclusion,  which 
requires that the disorders listed in Table 103-3 be ruled out.

The presence of teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, mye-
locytes, and promyelocytes establishes the presence of extramedullary 
hematopoiesis,  while  the  presence  of  leukocytosis,  thrombocytosis 
with large and bizarre platelets, and circulating myelocytes suggests the 
presence of an MPN as opposed to a secondary form of myelofibrosis 
(Table  103-3).  Marrow  is  usually  inaspirable  due  to  increased  mar-
row  reticulin,  but  marrow  biopsy  will  reveal  a  hypercellular  marrow 
with  trilineage  hyperplasia  and,  in  particular,  increased  numbers  of 
megakaryocytes in clusters and with large, dysplastic nuclei. However, 
there  are  no  characteristic  bone  marrow  morphologic  abnormalities 
that  distinguish  PMF  from  the  other  MPNs.  Splenomegaly  due  to 
extramedullary  hematopoiesis  may  be  sufficiently  massive  to  cause 
portal hypertension and variceal formation. In some patients, exuber-
ant  extramedullary  hematopoiesis  can  dominate  the  clinical  picture. 
An intriguing feature of PMF is the occurrence of autoimmune abnor-
malities such as immune complexes, antinuclear antibodies, rheuma-
toid factor, or a positive Coombs’ test. Whether these represent a host 
reaction to the disorder or are involved in its pathogenesis is unknown. 
Cytogenetic analysis of the blood is useful both to exclude CML and 
for  prognostic  purposes  because  the  development  of  complex  karyo-
type abnormalities portends a poor prognosis in PMF. For unknown 
reasons, the number of circulating CD34+ cells is markedly increased 
in  PMF  (>15,000/μL)  compared  to  the  other  MPNs,  unless  they  too 
develop extramedullary hematopoiesis.

Importantly, ∼55% of PMF patients, like patients with its companion 
MPNs, express the JAK2 V617F mutation, often as homozygotes. Such 
patients  are  usually  older  and  have  higher  hematocrits  than  patients 
with  MPL  (4%)  or  CALR  (36%)  mutations;  PMF  patients  expressing 
an MPL mutation tend to be more anemic and have lower leukocyte 
counts than JAK2 V617F–positive patients. Somatic mutations (due to 
deletions [type 1] or insertions [type 2]) in exon 9 of CALR have been

TREATMENT
Primary Myelofibrosis

No specific therapy exists for PMF. The causes for anemia are mul-
tifarious and include ineffective erythropoiesis uncompensated by 
splenic  extramedullary  hematopoiesis,  hemodilution  due  to  sple-
nomegaly,  splenic  sequestration,  blood  loss  secondary  to  throm-
bocytopenia or portal hypertension, folic acid deficiency, systemic 
inflammation,  and  autoimmune  hemolysis.  Neither  recombinant 
erythropoietin  nor  androgens  such  as  danazol  have  proven  to  be 
consistently  effective  as  therapy  for  anemia.  Erythropoietin  may 
worsen  splenomegaly  and  will  be  ineffective  if  the  serum  ery-
thropoietin  level  is  >125  mU/L.  Given  the  inflammatory  milieu 
that  characterizes  PMF,  glucocorticoids  can  ameliorate  anemia  as 
well as constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, 
anorexia, and weight loss, and combining these with low-dose tha-
lidomide  has  proved  effective  as  well.  Thrombocytopenia  can  be 
due to impaired marrow function, splenic sequestration, or autoim-
mune destruction and may also respond to low-dose thalidomide 
and prednisone.

Splenomegaly is by far the most distressing and intractable prob-
lem for PMF patients, causing abdominal pain, portal hypertension, 
easy  satiety,  and  cachexia,  whereas  surgical  removal  of  a  massive 
spleen  is  associated  with  significant  postoperative  complications 
including  mesenteric  venous  thrombosis,  hemorrhage,  rebound 
leukocytosis  and  thrombocytosis,  and  hepatic  extramedullary 
hematopoiesis with no amelioration of either anemia or thrombo-
cytopenia when present. For unexplained reasons, splenectomy also 
increases the risk of blastic transformation.

Splenic irradiation is, at best, temporarily palliative and associ-
ated with a significant risk of neutropenia, infection, and subsequent 
operative hemorrhage if splenectomy is attempted. Allopurinol can 
control significant hyperuricemia, and bone pain can be alleviated 
by local irradiation. Pegylated IFN-α can ameliorate fibrosis in early 
PMF, but in advanced disease, it may exacerbate the bone marrow 
failure.  The  JAK2  inhibitor  ruxolitinib  has  proved  effective  in 
reducing splenomegaly and alleviating constitutional symptoms in 
a majority of advanced PMF patients while possibly prolonging sur-
vival, although it usually does not significantly influence the JAK2 
V617F  neutrophil  allele  burden.  Although  anemia  and  thrombo-
cytopenia are its major side effects, these are dose-dependent, and 
with time, anemia stabilizes and thrombocytopenia may improve. 
Fedratinib, a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-FLT3 activity, 
has proved useful in patients with disease refractory to ruxolitinib.
In  some  patients,  hypomethylating  agents  such  as  azacytidine 
or decitabine in combination with high-dose ruxolitinib have been 
used  to  control  the  disease  or  prepare  patients  for  bone  marrow 
transplantation. Transformation to acute leukemia in PMF, like PV 
or ET, is usually refractory to treatment.

Allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation  is  the  only  curative 
treatment for PMF and should be considered in younger patients 
and  older  patients  with  high-risk  disease;  nonmyeloablative  con-
ditioning regimens permit hematopoietic cell transplantation to be 
extended to older individuals.

ESSENTIAL THROMBOCYTOSIS
ET  (other  designations  include  essential  thrombocythemia,  idiopathic 
thrombocytosis,  primary  thrombocytosis,  and  hemorrhagic  thrombo-
cythemia)  is  a  clonal  hematopoietic  stem  cell  disorder  associated 
with  mutations  in  JAK2  (V617F),  MPL,  or  CALR  and  manifested 
clinically by overproduction of platelets without a definable cause. ET 
has an incidence of 1–2/100,000 and a distinct female predominance. 
Canonical  MPN  driver  mutations  distinguish  90%  of  ET  patients 
from the more common nonclonal, reactive forms of thrombocytosis  
(Table 103-6); mutation-negative ET patients may have either uncom-
mon MPL mutations, JAK2 V617F expression limited to the platelets, 
or a hereditary form of thrombocytosis. Once considered a disease of 
the elderly and responsible for significant morbidity due to hemorrhage

or thrombosis, it is now clear that ET can occur at any age in adults and 
often  without  symptoms  or  disturbances  of  hemostasis.  There  is  an 
unexplained female predominance in contrast to PMF or the reactive 
forms  of  thrombocytosis  where  no  sex  difference  exists.  Because  no 
specific clonal marker is available, clinical and laboratory criteria have 
been  proposed  to  distinguish  ET  from  other  MPNs,  which  may  also 
present with initially with isolated thrombocytosis but have differing 
prognoses  and  therapies  (Table  103-6).  These  criteria  are  useful  in 
identifying disorders such as CML, PV, PMF, or myelodysplasia, which 
can  masquerade  as  ET.  Furthermore,  as  with  “idiopathic”  erythrocy-
tosis, nonclonal benign forms of thrombocytosis exist (e.g., hereditary 
overproduction of thrombopoietin and those with noncanonical JAK2 
driver mutations) that are not widely recognized because we currently 
lack diagnostic assays. Approximately 50% of ET patients express JAK2 
V617F, 30% CALR (both type 1 and type 2), and 8% MPL mutations. 
ET patients lacking a canonical MPN driver mutation usually have a 
benign prognosis.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
Megakaryocytopoiesis  and  platelet  production  depend  on  thrombo-
poietin  and  its  receptor  MPL.  As  in  the  case  of  early  erythroid  and 
myeloid  progenitor  cells,  early  megakaryocytic  progenitors  require 
the  presence  of  interleukin  3  (IL-3)  and  stem  cell  factor  for  optimal 
proliferation in addition to thrombopoietin. Their subsequent terminal 
development is also enhanced by the chemokine stromal cell-derived 
factor  1  (SDF-1).  Interestingly,  terminal  megakaryocyte  maturation 
and platelet production do not require thrombopoietin.

Megakaryocytes  are  unique  among  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells 
because  reduplication  of  their  genome  is  endomitotic  rather  than 
mitotic  and  promoted  by  thrombopoietin.  Unlike  erythropoietin, 
thrombopoietin  is  produced  primarily  in  the  liver  but  has  impor-
tant  functions  in  the  bone  marrow  where  it  functions  to  maintain 
hematopoietic  stem  cells  quiescent  in  their  endosteal  niches;  once 
released  from  their  niches,  thrombopoietin  promotes  the  prolifera-
tion of these cells in the sinusoidal niche. Like plasma erythropoietin 
and  its  target  erythroblasts,  an  inverse  correlation  exists  between 
the  platelet  count  and  plasma  thrombopoietin.  However,  unlike  ery-
thropoietin,  thrombopoietin  is  only  constitutively  produced  and  the 
plasma thrombopoietin level is controlled by the size of the platelet and 
megakaryocyte  progenitor  cell  pools.  Also,  in  contrast  to  erythropoi-
etin,  but  like  its  myeloid  counterparts,  granulocyte  and  granulocyte- 
macrophage  colony-stimulating  factors,  thrombopoietin  not  only 
enhances the proliferation of its target cells but also enhances the reac-
tivity of their end-stage product, the platelet. Paradoxically, in the three 
MPNs,  expression  of  the  thrombopoietin  receptor,  MPL,  is  impaired 
and plasma thrombopoietin is increased despite the increased number 
of megakaryocytes and platelets.

The  clonal  nature  of  ET  was  established  by  analysis  of  glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzyme expression in patients hemizygous 
for this gene. Although thrombocytosis is its principal manifestation,

like the other MPNs, a hematopoietic stem cell is involved in ET. Fur-
thermore, a number of families have been described in which ET was 
inherited, in one instance as an autosomal dominant trait. In addition 
to ET, PMF and PV have also been observed in such kindreds.

 ■ CLINICAL FEATURES
Clinically,  ET  is  most  often  identified  incidentally  when  a  platelet 
count  is  obtained  during  the  course  of  a  routine  medical  evaluation. 
Occasionally,  review  of  previous  blood  counts  will  reveal  that  an 
elevated  platelet  count  was  present  but  overlooked  for  many  years. 
No symptoms or signs are specific for ET, but these patients can have 
hemorrhagic  and  thrombotic  tendencies  expressed  as  easy  bruising 
for the former and microvascular occlusive events for the latter such 
as erythromelalgia, ocular migraine, or a TIA. Physical examination is 
generally unremarkable. Splenomegaly is indicative of another MPN, 
in particular PV, PMF, or CML.

Anemia  is  unusual,  but  a  mild  neutrophilic  leukocytosis  is  not. 
The blood smear is most remarkable for the number of platelets pres-
ent,  some  of  which  may  be  very  large.  The  large  mass  of  circulating 
platelets  may  prevent  the  accurate  measurement  of  serum  potassium 
due to release of platelet potassium upon blood clotting. This type of 
hyperkalemia is a test tube artifact and not associated with electrocar-
diographic abnormalities. Similarly, arterial oxygen measurements can 
be inaccurate unless thrombocythemic blood is collected on ice. The 
prothrombin  and  partial  thromboplastin  times  are  normal,  whereas 
abnormalities  of  platelet  function  such  as  a  prolonged  bleeding  time 
and  impaired  platelet  aggregation  can  be  present.  However,  despite 
much  study,  no  platelet  function  abnormality  is  characteristic  of  ET, 
and no platelet function test predicts the risk of clinically significant 
bleeding or thrombosis.

The  elevated  platelet  count  may  hinder  marrow  aspiration,  but 
marrow biopsy usually reveals megakaryocyte hypertrophy and hyper-
plasia, as well as an overall increase in marrow cellularity. If marrow 
reticulin  is  increased,  another  diagnosis  should  be  considered.  The 
absence  of  stainable  iron  demands  an  explanation  because  iron  defi-
ciency alone can cause thrombocytosis, and absent marrow iron in the 
presence of marrow hypercellularity is a feature of PV.

Nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities occur in ET but are uncom-
mon, and no specific or consistent abnormality is notable, even those 
involving chromosomes 3 and 1, where the genes for thrombopoietin 
and its receptor, MPL, respectively, are located.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS
Thrombocytosis is encountered in a broad variety of clinical disorders 
(Table  103-6),  in  many  of  which  inflammatory  cytokine  production 
is  increased.  The  absolute  level  of  the  platelet  count  is  not  a  useful 
diagnostic aid for distinguishing between benign and clonal causes of 
thrombocytosis.  About  50%  of  ET  patients  express  the  JAK2  V617F 
mutation. When JAK2 V617F is absent, cytogenetic evaluation is man-
datory to determine if the thrombocytosis is due to CML or a myelo-
dysplastic disorder such as the 5q– syndrome or sideroblastic anemia. 
Because the BCR-ABL translocation can be present in the absence of 
the Ph chromosome, and because the BCR-ABL reverse transcriptase 
polymerase  chain  reaction  is  associated  with  false-positive  results, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for BCR-ABL is the 
preferred assay in patients with thrombocytosis in whom a cytogenetic 
study for the Ph chromosome is negative. CALR mutations (type 1 or 
type  2)  are  present  in  30%  and  MPL  mutations  are  present  in  8%  of 
ET  patients  who  do  not  have  a  JAK2  mutation.  Anemia  and  ringed 
sideroblasts are not features of ET, but they are features of idiopathic 
refractory  sideroblastic  anemia,  and  in  some  of  these  patients,  the 
thrombocytosis occurs in association with expression of JAK2 V617F, 
CALR, or an MPL mutation. Significant splenomegaly should suggest 
the  presence  of  another  MPN,  and  in  this  setting,  a  red  cell  mass 
determination  should  be  performed  because  splenomegaly  can  mask 
the presence of erythrocytosis. Importantly, what appears to be ET can 
evolve into PV (usually in women with JAK2 V617F) or PMF (usually 
in men with type 1 CALR mutations) after a period of many years due 
to  clonal  evolution  or  succession.  There  is  sufficient  overlap  of  the 

JAK2  V617F  neutrophil  allele  burden  between  ET  and  PV  that  this 
cannot be used as a distinguishing diagnostic feature with the excep-
tion that, in ET, the quantitative JAK2 V617F neutrophil allele is never 
greater than 50%; only a red cell mass and plasma volume determina-
tion can distinguish PV from ET, and importantly in this regard, 64% 
of JAK2 V617F–positive ET patients in one study actually were found 
to have PV when red cell mass and plasma volume determinations were 
performed.  Claims  that  ET  and  PV  form  a  biological  continuum  are 
unfounded  as  these  disorders  have  different  gene  expression  profiles 
and different natural histories.

 ■ COMPLICATIONS
Perhaps  no  other  condition  in  clinical  medicine  has  caused  other-
wise  astute  physicians  to  intervene  inappropriately  more  often  than 
thrombocytosis, particularly if the platelet count is >1 × 106/μL. It is 
commonly believed that a high platelet count causes thrombosis; how-
ever, no controlled clinical study has ever established this association, 
and in patients younger than age 60 years, the incidence of thrombosis 
was not greater in patients with thrombocytosis than in age-matched 
controls, and tobacco use appears to be the most important risk factor 
for thrombosis in ET patients.

To  the  contrary,  very  high  platelet  counts  are  associated  primarily 
with hemorrhage due to acquired von Willebrand’s disease. This is not 
meant to imply that an elevated platelet count cannot cause symptoms 
in an ET patient, but rather that the focus should be on the patient, not 
the platelet count. For example, some of the most dramatic neurologic 
problems in ET are migraine-related and respond only to lowering of 
the  platelet  count,  whereas  other  symptoms  such  as  erythromelalgia 
respond simply to platelet cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors such as aspirin 
or ibuprofen, without a reduction in platelet number. Still others may 
represent  an  interaction  between  an  atherosclerotic  vascular  system 
and  a  high  platelet  count,  and  others  may  have  no  relationship  to 
the  platelet  count  whatsoever.  Recognition  that  PV  can  present  with 
thrombocytosis alone as well as the discovery of previously unrecog-
nized  causes  of  hypercoagulability  (Chaps.  116  and  117)  make  the 
older literature on the complications of thrombocytosis unreliable.

TREATMENT
Essential Thrombocytosis

Survival of ET patients is not different than the general population 
regardless  of  their  driver  mutation.  An  elevated  platelet  count  in 
an  asymptomatic  patient  without  cardiovascular  risk  factors  or 
tobacco use requires no therapy. Indeed, before any therapy is initi-
ated in a patient with thrombocytosis, the cause of symptoms must 
be  clearly  identified  as  due  to  the  elevated  platelet  count.  When 
the platelet count rises above 1 × 106/μL, a substantial quantity of 
high-molecular-weight  von  Willebrand  multimers  are  removed 
from  the  circulation  and  destroyed  by  the  enlarged  platelet  mass, 
resulting in an acquired form of von Willebrand’s disease. This can 
be  identified  by  a  reduction  in  ristocetin  cofactor  activity.  In  this 
situation, aspirin could promote hemorrhage. Bleeding in this situ-
ation is rarely spontaneous and usually responds to tranexamic acid 
or ε-aminocaproic acid, which can be given prophylactically before 
and after elective surgery.

Plateletpheresis  is  at  best  a  temporary  and  inefficient  remedy 
that is rarely required. Importantly, ET patients treated with 32P or 
alkylating agents are at risk of developing acute leukemia without 
any  proof  of  benefit;  combining  either  therapy  with  hydroxyurea 
increases this risk. If platelet reduction is deemed necessary on the 
basis of symptoms refractory to salicylates alone, pegylated IFN-α, 
the quinazoline derivative anagrelide, or hydroxyurea can be used 
to reduce the platelet count, but none of these is uniformly effective 
or  without  significant  side  effects.  Hydroxyurea  and  aspirin  were 
more  effective  than  anagrelide  and  aspirin  for  prevention  of  TIA 
because  hydroxyurea  is  a  nitric  oxide  donor,  but  they  were  not 
more effective for the prevention of other types of arterial throm-
bosis and actually less effective for venous thrombosis. The risk of 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   808

21/01/22   3:51 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologygastrointestinal  bleeding  is  also  higher  when  aspirin  is  combined 
with  anagrelide.  Normalizing  the  platelet  count  does  not  prevent 
either arterial or venous thrombosis. Pegylated interferon can pro-
duce a complete molecular remission in some ET patients, but a role 
for it or ruxolitinib in ET management has not yet been established.
As more clinical experience is acquired, ET appears more benign 
than previously thought. Evolution to acute leukemia is more likely 
to be a consequence of therapy than of the disease itself. In manag-
ing patients with thrombocytosis, the physician’s first obligation is 
to do no harm.

104 Acute Myeloid Leukemia

William Blum

INCIDENCE
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a neoplasm characterized by infil-
tration of the blood, bone marrow, and other tissues by proliferative, 
clonal, poorly differentiated cells of the hematopoietic system. These 
leukemias  comprise  a  spectrum  of  malignancies  that  untreated  are 
uniformly fatal. In 2020, the estimated number of new AML cases in 
the United States was 19,940. AML is the diagnosis in 1.3% of all cancer 
cases and 31% of all new acute leukemias but causes 62% of leukemic 
deaths.  AML  is  the  most  common  acute  leukemia  in  older  patients, 
with  a  median  age  at  diagnosis  of  67  years.  Long-term  survival  is 
infrequent; U.S. registry data report that only 27% of patients survive 
5 years.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
Most  cases  of  AML  are  idiopathic.  Genetic  predisposition,  radiation, 
chemical/other  occupational  exposures,  and  drugs  have  been  impli-
cated  in  the  development  of  AML,  but  AML  cases  with  established 
etiology are relatively rare. No direct evidence suggests a viral etiology. 
Genome sequencing studies suggest that most cases of AML arise from 
a  limited  number  of  mutations  that  accumulate  with  advancing  age. 
Indeed,  genome  sequencing  is  providing  paradigm-shifting  advances 
in  our  understanding  of  leukemogenesis.  The  Cancer  Genome  Atlas 
(TCGA) and other databases demonstrate that blood cells from up to 
5–6% of normal individuals aged >70 years contain potentially “prema-
lignant” mutations that are associated with clonal expansion.

Use  of  the  term  premalignant  to  describe  these  lesions  is  not  pre-
cisely accurate; rather, these mutations represent clonal hematopoiesis 
of indeterminate potential (CHIP; sometimes called age-related clonal 
hematopoiesis). The genes most commonly altered include the epige-
netic regulators DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1.

Study  of  CHIP  is  important  because  CHIP  has  relevance  not  just 
to  blood  cancer  evolution  but  also  other  medical  conditions.  Clonal 
expansion  driven  by  the  acquisition  of  new  mutations  is  associated 
with  a  10-fold  increase  in  risk  for  developing  a  hematologic  malig-
nancy  (compared  to  matched  patients  without  CHIP),  but  it  is  clear 
that  additional  “hits”  must  occur  to  drive  toward  leukemia.  We  do 

809

not  yet  fully  understand  why  or  how  these  secondary  lesions  occur. 
Patients with CHIP also have increased risk of cardiovascular mortality 
that is not fully explained. The link between these two seemingly unre-
lated  issues  (cardiovascular  and  hematologic  malignancy)  may  lie  in 
understanding the interactions between circulating clonally expanded 
blood  cells  and  vascular  endothelium.  A  “proinflammatory”  state 
caused  by  clonal,  infiltrating  monocytes  leads  to  accelerated  athero-
sclerotic plaque development and altered cardiac remodeling. Similar 
phenomena may occur in the marrow and blood—altered relationships 
between hematopoietic stem cells with the marrow microenvironment 
along with altered immune surveillance. Both increase the likelihood 
that a clone may survive, acquire additional mutations, and then fur-
ther  expand  eventually  to  leukemia.  Whether  early  identification  of 
CHIP  in  patients  will  provide  therapeutic  opportunities  for  patients 
remains to be seen. Certainly, modifying cardiovascular risk in patients 
with  CHIP  seems  prudent,  but  development  of  mutation-directed 
therapies to eliminate problematic clones to prevent leukemia is likely 
to be more elusive.

Genetic Predisposition  Myeloid neoplasms typically occur spo-
radically in adults; inherited predisposition is rare. Yet, it is clear that 
myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition represent an impor-
tant  and  growing  subset  of  disease.  Germline  mutations  associated 
with increased risk of developing a myeloid neoplasm include CEBPA, 
DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6, and GATA2 (Table 104-1). Like-
wise, myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition are a feature of 
several well-described clinical syndromes, including bone marrow fail-
ure disorders (e.g., Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, 
Diamond-Blackfan anemia) and telomere biology disorders (e.g., dys-
keratosis congenita). As new mutations and associations are added to a 
rapidly growing list, it is increasingly clear that genetic predisposition 
plays a larger role than has been previously understood.

Several  genetic  syndromes  with  somatic  cell  chromosome  aneu-
ploidy, such as Down syndrome with trisomy 21, are associated with 
an  increased  incidence  of  AML.  Down  syndrome–associated  AML 
in young children (<4 years) is typically of the acute megakaryocytic 
subtype  and  is  associated  with  mutation  in  the  GATA1  gene.  Such

aRecognition of familial myeloid neoplasms requires that physicians take a thorough 
patient and family history to assess for typical signs and symptoms of known 
syndromes, including data on malignancies and previous bleeding episodes. 
Molecular genetic diagnostics is guided by a detailed patient and family history. 
Diagnostics should be performed in close collaboration with a genetic counselor; 
patients with a suspected heritable myeloid neoplasm, who test negative for known 
predisposition genes, should ideally be entered on a research study to facilitate 
new syndrome discovery. bLymphoid neoplasms also reported.

patients have excellent clinical outcomes but require dose modification 
of  chemotherapy  due  to  high  treatment-related  toxicities.  Inherited 
diseases with defective DNA repair (e.g., Fanconi anemia, Bloom syn-
drome, and ataxia-telangiectasia) are also associated with AML. Each 
syndrome is associated with unique clinical features and atypical toxic-
ities with chemotherapy, requiring expert care. Congenital neutropenia 
(Kostmann  syndrome),  due  to  mutations  in  the  genes  encoding  the 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor and neutrophil elastase, 
is another disorder that may evolve into AML.

Chemical, Radiation, and Other Exposures  Anticancer drugs are 
the leading cause of therapy-associated AML. Alkylating agent–associated 
leukemias occur on average 4–6 years after exposure, and affected indi-
viduals often have multilineage dysplasia and monosomy/aberrations in 
chromosomes 5 and 7. Topoisomerase II inhibitor–associated leukemias 
occur  1–3  years  after  exposure,  and  affected  individuals  often  have 
AML with monocytic features and aberrations involving chromosome 
11q23. Exposure to ionizing radiation, benzene, chloramphenicol, phe-
nylbutazone, and other drugs can uncommonly result in bone marrow 
failure that may evolve into AML.
 ■ CLASSIFICATION
The current categorization of AML uses the World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification (Table 104-2), which defines biologically distinct 
groups based on cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in addition 
to  clinical  features  and  light  microscope  morphology.  Myeloid  neo-
plasms with germline predisposition, as introduced above, are included 
as  a  new  and  important  feature  of  this  classification  (Table  104-1).

Source: Adapted from DA Arber et al: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 
recurrent genetic abnormalities, in World Health Organization Classification 
of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, 4th revised ed. Geneva, 
Switzerland: World Health Organization; 2017.

The WHO classification enables the identification of subsets of disease 
that  may  be  treated  differently  (now  or  in  the  future)  and  enhances 
recognition of the molecular basis of disease from the time of diagno-
sis. Marrow (or blood) blast count of ≥20% is required to establish the 
diagnosis of AML, except for AML with the recurrent genetic abnor-
malities t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16), or t(16;16).

Clinical Features  Even with advances in molecular biology, recog-
nizing clinical features remains important in understanding AML. For 
example, therapy-related AML is a distinct entity that develops follow-
ing prior chemotherapy (e.g., alkylating agents, topoisomerase II inhib-
itors) or ionizing radiation. AML with myelodysplasia-related changes 
is recognized in part on morphology but also on a medical history of 
an  antecedent  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  or  myelodysplastic/
myeloproliferative neoplasm. These clinical features contribute to AML 
prognosis and are therefore in the WHO classification.

Genetic  Findings  Subtypes  of  AML  are  recognized  due  to 
the presence or absence of specific, recurrent cytogenetic, and/or 
genetic abnormalities. For example, the diagnosis of acute promy-
elocytic leukemia (APL) is based on the presence of either the t(15;17)
(q22;q12) cytogenetic rearrangement or the PML-RARA fusion prod-
uct of the translocation. Similarly, core binding factor (CBF) AML is 
designated  based  on  the  presence  of  t(8;21)(q22;q22),  inv(16)
(p13.1q22),  or  t(16;16)(p13.1;q22)  or  the  respective  fusion  products 
RUNX1-RUNX1T1  and  CBFB-MYH11.  Each  of  these  three  groups 
identifies patients with favorable clinical outcomes when appropriately 
treated.

Several cytogenetic or genetic AML subtypes often associate with a 
specific morphologic appearance, such as a complex karyotype (and/
or mutation of TP53) and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. 
Patients  with  such  changes  typically  fare  poorly  with  standard  treat-
ments.  However,  only  one  abnormality  is  invariably  associated  with 
specific  morphologic  features:  t(15;17)(q22;q12)  or  the  molecular 
fusion PML-RARA with APL. Other cytogenetic and genetic findings 
may  be  commonly,  but  not  always,  associated  with  a  morphologic 
description, highlighting the necessity of genetic and cytogenetic test-
ing  for  precise  diagnosis.  Several  chromosomal  abnormalities  often 
associate primarily with one morphologic/immunophenotypic group. 
Examples  include  inv(16)(p13.1q22)  with  AML  with  abnormal  bone 
marrow eosinophils; t(8;21)(q22;q22) with slender Auer rods, expres-
sion of CD19, and increased normal eosinophils; and t(9;11)(p22;q23) 
and  other  translocations  involving  11q23  with  monocytic  features. 
Mutation of nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin, 
NPM1),  especially  when  co-occurring  with  mutation  of  fms-related 
tyrosine  kinase  3  (FLT3),  often  presents  with  “cup-shaped”  nuclear 
morphology. Recurring chromosomal abnormalities in AML may also 
be loosely associated with specific clinical characteristics. More com-
monly associated with younger age are t(8;21) and t(15;17), and with 
older age, del(5q), del(7q), and mutated TP53. Myeloid sarcomas are 
associated with t(8;21); disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
is associated with t(15;17). 11q23 aberrations and monocytic leukemia 
are associated with extramedullary sites of involvement at presentation, 
especially  gingival  hypertrophy.  High  leukocyte  count  is  commonly 
observed with NPM1 or FLT3 mutation.

The WHO classification also incorporates molecular abnormalities 
by recognizing fusion genes or specific genetic mutations with a role 
in leukemogenesis. As a classic example, t(15;17) results in the fusion 
gene PML-RARA that encodes a chimeric protein, promyelocytic leu-
kemia (Pml)–retinoic acid receptor α (Rarα), which is formed by the 
fusion of the retinoic acid receptor α (RARA) gene from chromosome 
17 and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene from chromosome 15. 
Unique clinical therapy with retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide has rev-
olutionized the care of APL patients (see “Treatment of Acute Promy-
elocytic  Leukemia”  section).  Similar  examples  of  molecular  subtypes 
included in the category of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities 
are  those  characterized  by  the  leukemogenic  fusion  genes  RUNX1- 
RUNX1T1  and  CBFB-MYH11  and  the  so-called  CBF  AML  subtypes 
noted cytogenetically as t(8;21), inv(16), or t(16;16). Additional fusions

are  MLLT3-KMT2A  and  DEK-NUP214,  resulting  from  t(9;11)  and 
t(6;9)(p23;q34), respectively, among others.

The WHO classification of AML continues to expand as knowledge 
of  specific  genetic  or  cytogenetic  aberrations  grows.  Several  AML 
subtypes are defined by the presence of genetic mutations rather than 
chromosomal aberrations. For example, AML with mutated NPM1 and 
AML  with  biallelic  mutated  CEBPA,  respectively,  are  associated  with 
more  favorable  clinical  outcome,  though  the  presence  of  coexisting 
mutation in FLT3 affects NPM1 prognostic impact. Activating muta-
tions  of  FLT3  are  present  in  ∼30%  of  adult  AML  patients,  primarily  
due  to  internal  tandem  duplications  (ITDs)  in  the  juxtamembrane 
domain that have negative prognostic impact. In contrast, point muta-
tions of the activating loop of the kinase (called tyrosine kinase domain 
[TKD] mutations) have uncertain prognostic impact. Aberrant activa-
tion of the FLT3-encoded protein provides increased proliferation and 
antiapoptotic  signals  to  the  myeloid  progenitor  cell.  FLT3-ITD,  the 
more common of the FLT3 mutations, occurs preferentially in patients 
with  cytogenetically  normal  AML  (CN-AML).  The  importance  of 
identifying FLT3-ITD at diagnosis relates to the fact that it is not only 
useful  as  a  prognosticator  but  also  may  predict  response  to  specific 
treatment  such  as  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI).  Several  TKIs 
targeting  FLT3  are  either  approved  for  AML  (e.g.,  midostaurin,  only 
in  first-line  therapy  in  combination  with  chemotherapy;  gilteritinib, 
in relapse as monotherapy) or currently in clinical investigation (e.g., 
quizartinib,  crenolanib,  sorafenib,  and  others).  The  FLT3  allelic  ratio 
(of the number of mutated alleles to wild-type alleles) provides infor-
mation beyond the mere presence or absence of the mutation. Several 
mutational scenarios, such as one mutated gene and one wild-type gene 
or one mutated gene with no (deleted) wild-type gene, and the ratio 
of malignant to nonmalignant cells in the sample affect the ratio. The 
allelic ratio affects the prognostic impact of the FLT3-ITD mutation; 
patients with FLT3-ITD “low” allelic ratio (<0.5) fare better. Accord-
ingly, mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD or with FLT3-ITDlow is viewed 
as favorable risk by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk stratifica-
tion  schema  (Table  104-3).  Conversely,  FLT3-ITDhigh  has  an  adverse 
prognostic impact; patients with both mutated NPM1 and FLT3-ITD 
with  an  allelic  ratio  >0.5  are  intermediate  risk  by  ELN  stratification. 
Involving a different tyrosine kinase, AML with BCR-ABL1 fusion is a 
new WHO provisional entity to recognize rare cases that may benefit 
from BCR-ABL TKI therapy (Table 104-2).

Immunophenotypic Findings  The immunophenotype of human 
leukemia cells can be studied by multiparameter flow cytometry after 
the  cells  are  labeled  with  monoclonal  antibodies  to  cell-surface  anti-
gens. This can be important in quickly distinguishing AML from acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  and  for  identifying  some  subtypes  of  AML. 
For  example,  AML  with  minimal  differentiation,  characterized  by 
immature morphology and no lineage-specific cytochemical reactions, 
may be diagnosed by flow-cytometric demonstration of the myeloid- 
specific  antigens  cluster  designation  (CD)  13  and/or  117.  Simi-
larly,  acute  megakaryoblastic  leukemia  can  often  be  diagnosed  only 
by  expression  of  the  platelet-specific  antigens  CD41  and/or  CD61. 
Although flow cytometry is widely used, and in some cases essential for 
the diagnosis of AML, it has only a supportive role in establishing the 
different  subtypes  of  AML  through  the  WHO  classification.  Increas-
ingly, multiparameter flow cytometry is used for the measurement of 
measurable residual disease (MRD) after remission is achieved.

 ■ PROGNOSTIC FACTORS
Several  factors  predict  outcome  of  AML  patients  treated  with  che-
motherapy;  they  should  be  used  for  risk  stratification  and  treatment 
guidance.

Chromosome and molecular investigations performed at diagnosis 
currently provide the most important prognostic information. WHO 
has categorized patients as having favorable, intermediate, or adverse 
risk  based  on  the  presence  of  structural  and/or  numerical  chromo-
somal or genetic aberrations. Patients with t(15;17) have a very good 
prognosis  (∼85%  cured),  and  those  with  t(8;21)  and  inv(16)  have  a 
good  prognosis  (∼55%  cured),  whereas  those  with  no  cytogenetic

aThis table excludes acute promyelocytic leukemia. Frequencies, response rates, 
and outcome measures should be reported by risk category and, if sufficient 
numbers are available, by specific genetic lesions indicated. bPrognostic impact of 
a marker is treatment-dependent and may change with new therapies. cLow, low 
allelic ratio (<0.5); high, high allelic ratio (≥0.5); semiquantitative assessment of FLT3-
ITD allelic ratio (using DNA fragment analysis) is determined as ratio of the area 
under the curve (AUC) “FLT3-ITD” divided by AUC “FLT3-wild type”; recent studies 
indicate that acute myeloid leukemia with NPM1 mutation and FLT3-ITD low allelic 
ratio may also have a more favorable prognosis and patients should not routinely be 
assigned to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. dThe presence of

abnormality have an intermediate outcome risk (∼40% cured). Patients 
with a TP53 mutation, complex karyotype, t(6;9), inv(3), or –7 have a 
very  poor  prognosis.  Another  cytogenetic  subgroup,  the  monosomal 
karyotype,  has  been  suggested  to  adversely  influence  the  outcome 
of  AML  patients  other  than  those  with  t(15;17),  t(8;21),  or  inv(16) 
or  t(16;16).  The  monosomal  karyotype  subgroup  is  defined  by  the 
presence of at least two autosomal monosomies (loss of chromosomes 
other than Y or X) or a single autosomal monosomy with additional 
structural abnormalities.

For patients lacking prognostic cytogenetic abnormalities, i.e., those 
with  CN-AML,  testing  for  several  mutated  genes  can  help  to  risk- 
stratify.  In  addition  to  NPM1  mutation  and  FLT3-ITD  as  described 
above,  biallelic  CEBPA  mutations  have  prognostic  value.  Such  muta-
tions predict favorable outcome. Given the proven prognostic impor-
tance of NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3, molecular assessment of these genes 
at diagnosis has been incorporated into AML management guidelines 
by  the  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN)  and  the 
ELN.  The  same  markers  help  to  define  genetic  groups  in  the  ELN 
standardized reporting system, which is based on both cytogenetic and 
molecular  abnormalities  and  is  used  for  comparing  clinical  features/
treatment response among subsets of patients reported across different 
clinical studies (Table 104-3). These genetic groups should be used for 
risk stratification and treatment guidance.

In addition to NPM1, CEBPA , FLT3, and TP53 mutations, molec-
ular  aberrations  in  other  genes  may  be  routinely  used  for  prognosti-
cation (Table 104-4). Among these mutated genes are those encoding 
receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (KIT),  transcription  factors  (RUNX1  and 
WT1),  and  epigenetic  modifiers  (ASXL1,  DNMT3A,  isocitrate  dehy-
drogenase 1 [IDH1], IDH2, KMT2A [also known as MLL], and TET2). 
Although KIT mutations are almost exclusively present in CBF AML 
and impact adversely the outcome, the remaining markers have been 
reported primarily in CN-AML. Mutations of ASXL1 and RUNX1 are 
associated with adverse outcome, independent of other prognostic fac-
tors. However, for some of these mutations, data remain unclear on the 
prognostic impact due to conflicting reports (e.g., TET2, IDH1, IDH2). 
Increasingly,  novel  drugs  that  inhibit/modulate  aberrant  pathways 
activated by some of these genes (especially FLT3, IDH1, and IDH2) 
have  been  remarkably  effective  in  subsets  of  disease,  leading  to  U.S. 
Food  and  Drug  Administration  approvals  (see  section  on  treatment 
of AML).

In  addition  to  gene  mutations,  deregulation  of  the  expression 
levels  of  coding  genes  and  of  short  noncoding  RNAs  (microRNAs) 
also  provides  prognostic  information  (Table  104-4).  Overexpression 
of  genes  such  as  BAALC,  ERG,  MN1,  and  MDS1  and  EVI1  complex 
locus (MECOM; also known as EVI1) predict poor outcome, especially 
in  CN-AML.  Similarly,  deregulated  expression  levels  of  microRNAs, 
naturally  occurring  noncoding  RNAs  that  regulate  the  expression 
of  proteins  via  degradation  or  translational  inhibition  of  their  target 
coding RNAs, have also been associated with prognosis in AML. Over-
expression  of  miR-155  and  miR-3151  predicts  unfavorable  outcome 
in  CN-AML,  whereas  overexpression  of  miR-181a  predicts  favorable 
outcome both in CN-AML and cytogenetically abnormal AML.

Because  prognostic  molecular  markers  in  AML  are  not  mutually 
exclusive  and  often  occur  concurrently  (>80%  patients  have  at  least 
two  or  more  prognostic  gene  mutations),  the  likelihood  that  distinct 
marker combinations may be more informative than single markers is 
increasingly clear.

Epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation and/or posttranslational 
histone  modification)  and  microRNAs  are  often  involved  in  deregu-
lation  of  genes  involved  in  hematopoiesis,  contribute  to  leukemo-
genesis,  and  may  associate  with  the  previously  discussed  prognostic 
gene  mutations.  These  changes  have  been  shown  to  provide  biologic 
insights  into  leukemogenic  mechanisms  and  provide  independent 
prognostic  information.  Therapeutic  progress  based  on  advances  in 
understanding  the  role  of  epigenetic  changes  in  AML  is  currently 
unfolding. For example, in patients with mutations of IDH1 or IDH2, 
novel active enzymes produced from these respective mutations hijack 
the citric acid cycle, leading to production of a novel “oncometabolite,” 
2-hydroxyglutarate,  which  disrupts  a  myriad  of  epigenetic  processes. 
Pharmacologic inhibition of these aberrant enzymes can reverse these 
leukemogenic activities.

In addition to cytogenetic and molecular aberrations, several other 
factors are associated with outcome in AML. Age at diagnosis is one 
of the most important risk factors. Advancing age is associated with a 
poor prognosis for two reasons: (1) its influence on the ability to sur-
vive  induction  therapy  due  to  coexisting  medical  comorbidities,  and 
(2) with each successive decade of age, a greater proportion of patients 
have  intrinsically  more  resistant  disease.  A  prolonged  symptomatic 
interval  with  cytopenias  preceding  AML  diagnosis  or  a  history  of 
antecedent hematologic disorders including MDS or myeloproliferative 
neoplasms is often found in older patients. Cytopenia is a clinical fea-
ture associated with a lower complete remission (CR) rate and shorter 
survival time. The CR rate is lower in patients who have had anemia, 
leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia for >3 months before the diag-
nosis of AML, when compared to those without such a history. Respon-
siveness  to  chemotherapy  declines  as  the  duration  of  the  antecedent 
disorder  increases.  Likewise,  AML  developing  after  treatment  with 
cytotoxic  agents  for  other  malignancies  is  usually  difficult  to  treat 
successfully. In addition, older patients less frequently harbor favorable 
cytogenetic abnormalities (i.e., t[8;21], inv[16], and t[16;16]) and more 
frequently harbor adverse cytogenetic (e.g., complex and monosomal 
karyotypes) and/or molecular (e.g., ASXL1, TP53) abnormalities.

Other  factors  independently  associated  with  worse  outcome  are  a 
poor  performance  status  that  influences  ability  to  survive  induction 
therapy and a high presenting leukocyte count that in some series is 
an adverse prognostic factor for attaining a CR. Among patients with 
hyperleukocytosis (>100,000/μL), early central nervous system bleed-
ing and pulmonary leukostasis contribute to poor outcomes.

Following  administration  of  therapy,  achievement  of  CR  is  asso-
ciated  with  better  outcome  and  longer  survival.  CR  is  defined  after 
examination of both blood and bone marrow and essentially represents 
eradication of detectable leukemia and restoration of normal hemato-
poiesis. The blood neutrophil count must be ≥1000/μL and the platelet 
count  ≥100,000/μL.  Hemoglobin  concentration  is  not  considered  in 
determining  CR.  Circulating  blasts  should  be  absent.  Although  rare 
blasts  may  be  detected  in  the  blood  during  marrow  regeneration, 
they should disappear on successive studies. At CR, the bone marrow 
should contain <5% blasts, and Auer rods should be absent. Extramed-
ullary leukemia should not be present.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Symptoms  Patients  with  AML  usually  present  with  nonspecific 
symptoms that begin gradually, or abruptly, and are the consequence 
of anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia/leukocyte dysfunction, or throm-
bocytopenia.  Nearly  half  have  symptoms  for  ≤3  months  before  the 
leukemia is diagnosed.

Fatigue is a frequent first symptom among AML patients. Anorexia 
and  weight  loss  are  common.  Fever  with  or  without  an  identifiable 
infection  is  the  initial  symptom  in  ∼10%  of  patients.  Signs  of  abnor-
mal  hemostasis  (bleeding,  easy  bruising)  are  common.  Bone  pain,

PART 4Oncology and Hematologylymphadenopathy,  nonspecific  cough,  headache,  or  diaphoresis  may 
also occur.

Rarely,  patients  may  present  with  symptoms  from  a  myeloid  sar-
coma (a tumor mass consisting of myeloid blasts occurring at anatomic 
sites other than bone marrow). Sites involved are most commonly the 
skin, lymph node, gastrointestinal tract, soft tissue, and testis. This rare 
presentation,  often  characterized  by  chromosome  aberrations  (e.g., 
monosomy  7,  trisomy  8,  11q23  rearrangement,  inv[16],  trisomy  4, 
t[8;21]), may precede or coincide with blood and/or marrow involve-
ment  by  AML.  Patients  who  present  with  isolated  myeloid  sarcoma 
typically develop blood and/or marrow involvement quickly thereafter 
and cannot be cured with local therapy (radiation or surgery) alone.

Physical  Findings  Fever,  infection,  and  hemorrhage  are  often 
found at the time of diagnosis; splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphade-
nopathy, and “bone pain” may also be present less commonly. Hemor-
rhagic complications are most commonly and, classically, found in APL. 
APL patients often present with DIC-associated minor hemorrhage but 
may have significant gastrointestinal bleeding, intrapulmonary hemor-
rhage, or intracranial hemorrhage. Likewise, thrombosis is another less 
frequent but well recognized clinical feature of DIC in APL. Bleeding 
associated with coagulopathy may also occur in monocytic AML and 
with  extreme  degrees  of  leukocytosis  or  thrombocytopenia  in  other 
morphologic  subtypes.  Retinal  hemorrhages  are  detected  in  15%  of 
patients. Infiltration of the gingiva, skin, soft tissues, or meninges with 
leukemic blasts at diagnosis is characteristic of the monocytic subtypes 
and those with 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities.

Hematologic  Findings  Anemia  is  usually  present  at  diagnosis, 
although it is not typically severe. The anemia is usually normocytic 
normochromic. Decreased erythropoiesis in the setting of AML often 
results in a reduced reticulocyte count, and red blood cell (RBC) sur-
vival  is  decreased  by  accelerated  destruction.  Active  blood  loss  may 
rarely contribute to the anemia.

The  median  presenting  leukocyte  count  is  ∼15,000/μL.  Lower 
presenting  leukocyte  counts  are  more  typical  of  older  patients  and 
those  with  antecedent  hematologic  disorders.  Between  25  and  40% 
of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. 
Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. In AML, 
the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the 
nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli charac-
teristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer 
rods  are  not  uniformly  present,  but  when  they  are,  AML  is  virtually 
certain (Fig. 104-1).

Platelet  counts  <100,000/μL  are  found  at  diagnosis  in  ∼75%  of 
patients,  and  ∼25%  have  counts  <25,000/μL.  Both  morphologic  and 
functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and 
bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to 
aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment  Evaluation  Once  the  diagnosis  of  AML  is  sus-
pected,  thorough  evaluation  and  initiation  of  appropriate  therapy 
should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial 
studies  should  evaluate  the  overall  functional  integrity  of  the  major 
organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and

renal systems (Table 104-5). Factors that have prognostic significance, 
either  for  achieving  CR  or  for  CR  duration,  should  also  be  assessed 
before  initiating  treatment  including  cytogenetics  and  molecular 
markers.  Leukemic  cells  should  be  obtained  from  all  patients  and 

cryopreserved  for  future  investigational  testing  as  well  as  potential 
future  use  as  new  diagnostics  and  therapeutics  become  available.  All 
patients should be evaluated for infection. During the ongoing global 
pandemic,  testing  for  the  presence  of  the  novel  coronavirus,  SARS-
COV2, is recommended before initiation of chemotherapy.

Most  patients  are  anemic  and  thrombocytopenic  at  presentation. 
Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should 
begin  promptly.  Because  qualitative  platelet  dysfunction  or  the  pres-
ence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence 
of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even 
if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

About 50% of patients have a mild to moderate elevation of serum 
uric acid at presentation. Only 10% have marked elevations, but renal 
precipitation of uric acid and the nephropathy that may result is a seri-
ous but uncommon complication. The initiation of chemotherapy may 
aggravate hyperuricemia, and patients are usually started immediately 
on allopurinol and hydration at diagnosis. Rasburicase (recombinant 
uric oxidase) is also useful for treating uric acid nephropathy and often 
can  normalize  the  serum  uric  acid  level  within  hours  with  a  single 
dose  of  treatment,  although  its  expense  suggests  that  limiting  its  use 
to  patients  with  severe  hyperuricemia  and/or  kidney  injury  may  be 
prudent. The presence of high concentrations of lysozyme, a marker for 
monocytic differentiation, may be etiologic in renal tubular dysfunc-
tion for a minority of patients.

TREATMENT
Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Treatment  of  the  newly  diagnosed  patient  with  AML  is  usually 
divided into two phases, induction and postremission management 
(consolidation) (Fig. 104-2). The initial goal is to induce CR. Once 
CR is obtained, further therapy must be given to prolong survival 
and achieve cure. The initial induction treatment and subsequent 
postremission therapy are chosen based on the patient’s age, overall 
fitness, and cytogenetic/molecular risk. Intensive therapy with cyta-
rabine and anthracycline in younger patients (<60 years) increases 
the  cure  rate  of  AML.  In  older  patients,  the  benefit  of  intensive 
therapy  is  controversial  in  all  but  favorable-risk  patients;  novel 
approaches for selecting patients predicted to be responsive to treat-
ment and new therapies are being pursued. Additional options for 
therapy have emerged for older AML patients such as the addition 
of the BCL2 antagonist venetoclax to one of several low-intensity 
chemotherapies.  Likewise,  novel  oral  drugs  targeting  IDH1  or 
IDH2,  alone  or  in  combination  with  low-intensity  chemotherapy, 
may  be  considered  as  initial  therapy  for  older  patients  who  have 
mutations in those respective pathways. 
INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY
The  most  commonly  used  induction  regimens  (for  patients  other 
than  those  with  APL)  consist  of  combination  chemotherapy  with 
cytarabine  and  an  anthracycline  (e.g.,  daunorubicin,  idarubicin). 
Cytarabine  is  a  cell  cycle  S-phase–specific  antimetabolite  that 
becomes  phosphorylated  intracellularly  to  an  active  triphosphate 
form that interferes with DNA synthesis. Anthracyclines are DNA 
intercalators. Their primary mode of action is thought to be inhibi-
tion of topoisomerase II, leading to DNA breaks.

In adults, cytarabine used at standard dose (100–200 mg/m2) is 
administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days. With 
cytarabine,  anthracycline  therapy  generally  consists  of  daunoru-
bicin  (60–90  mg/m2)  or  idarubicin  (12  mg/m2)  intravenously  on 
days 1, 2, and 3 (the 7 and 3 regimen). Other agents can be added 
(e.g.,  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin)  when  60  mg/m2  of  daunorubicin 
is used. With the 7 and 3 regimen, it is now clearly established that 
45  mg/m2  dosing  of  daunorubicin  results  in  inferior  outcomes; 
patients  should  receive  higher  doses  as  described.  Patients  failing 
remission after one induction are offered reinduction with the same 
(or slightly modified) therapy. The CD33-targeting immunoconju-
gate gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be added to induction therapy 
for subsets of patients, especially those with CBF AML.

FIGURE  104-2  Algorithm  for  the  therapy  of  newly  diagnosed  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML).  aRisk  stratification  according  to  the  European  LeukemiaNet  (see  Table 
104-3).  bYounger patients (<60–65 years) should routinely be offered investigational therapy on a backbone of standard chemotherapy for induction and consolidation. 
cOlder patients, especially those >65 years or with adverse risk disease, or those who are unfit for intensive anthracycline + cytarabine regimens, may be considered for 
investigational therapy alone or in combination with lower intensity chemotherapy (azacitidine, decitabine, cytarabine), or lower intensity chemotherapy in combination 
with venetoclax. dInvestigational therapy as maintenance should be considered if available (after consolidation for younger patients and older patients with favorable-risk 
disease, and for all other older patients after induction).
    Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a consideration for all eligible patients in first complete remission (CR) with non–favorable-risk disease and highly 
recommended for older patients (60–75 years) and those with adverse risk.
    For all forms of AML in fit patients, except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), standard induction therapy includes a regimen based on a 7-day continuous infusion 
of cytarabine (100–200 mg/m2/d) and a 3-day course of daunorubicin (60–90 mg/m2/d) with or without additional drugs. Idarubicin (12 mg/m2/d) can be used in place of 
daunorubicin (not shown). The value of postremission/consolidation therapy for older patients (>60 years) who do not have favorable-risk disease is uncertain. Patients who 
achieve CR undergo postremission consolidation therapy, including sequential courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine, allogeneic HCT, autologous HCT, or novel therapies, 
based  on  their  predicted  risk  of  relapse  (i.e.,  risk-stratified  therapy).  Patients  receiving  induction  of  lower  intensity  chemotherapy  with  venetoclax  (or  investigational 
therapy) typically receive repetitive cycles of same on an attenuated schedule, if necessary due to myelotoxicity, after achieving remission. Patients with APL (see text for 
treatment) usually receive tretinoin and arsenic trioxide–based regimens with or without anthracycline-based chemotherapy and possibly maintenance with tretinoin. HLA,

In older patients (age ≥60–65 years), the outcome with conven-
tional intensive therapy is generally poor due to a higher frequency 
of  resistant  disease  and  increased  rate  of  treatment-related  mor-
tality.  This  is  especially  true  in  patients  with  prior  hematologic 
disorders (MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasms), therapy-related 
AML,  or  cytogenetic  and  genetic  abnormalities  that  adversely 
influence clinical outcome. Patients still fare far better with treat-
ment than with supportive care only. Conventional therapy for fit 
older  patients  is  similar  to  that  for  younger  patients:  the  7  and  3 
regimen with standard-dose cytarabine and idarubicin (12 mg/m2), 
or  daunorubicin  (60  mg/m2).  For  patients  aged  >65  years,  high-
dose  daunorubicin  (90  mg/m2)  has  increased  toxicity  and  is  not 
recommended.  A  novel  liposomal  preparation  of  cytarabine  and 
daunorubicin in a fixed molar ratio may instead be administered to 
fit patients with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes or aris-
ing from MDS. Older patients and those unable to receive intensive 
therapy  due  to  medical  comorbidity  may  receive  repetitive  cycles 
of  lower  intensity  therapy  with  a  hypomethylating  agent  (HMA; 
decitabine  or  azacitidine)  or  low-dose  cytarabine,  in  combination 
with daily venetoclax. As noted, targeted IDH1- or IDH2-directed 
therapy is another consideration. All patients should be considered 
for clinical trials. Investigational therapy remains the best option for 
many older patients but especially those with adverse-risk features. 
(Table 104-6).

With  the  7  and  3  regimen,  60–80%  of  younger  and  33–60% 
of  older  patients  (among  those  who  are  candidates  for  intensive 

therapy)  with  primary  AML  achieve  CR.  Response  rates  around 
60%  have  been  similarly  reported  with  the  combination  of  HMA 
plus venetoclax in older or infirm patient groups. Of patients who 
do not achieve CR, most have drug-resistant leukemia. Induction 
death is more frequent with advancing age and medical comorbid-
ity. Patients with refractory disease after induction should be con-
sidered for salvage treatments, preferably on clinical trials. Planning 
for the possibility of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanta-
tion (HCT) for all eligible patients under age 75 years is part of opti-
mal  initial  AML  care.  Typically,  allogeneic  HCT  is  performed  for 
patients in CR but at risk for relapse, but fit younger patients with 
primary refractory disease (not in remission after initial induction) 
have ∼15–20% cure rates with allogeneic HCT (after myeloablative 
conditioning).  For  this  reason,  early  planning  for  possible  future 
allogeneic HCT (including human leukocyte antigen [HLA] typing, 
donor search, etc.) should be part of the initial approach for most 
AML patients. 

POSTREMISSION THERAPY
Induction  of  a  durable  first  CR  (CR1)  is  critical  to  long-term 
survival  in  AML.  However,  without  further  therapy,  virtually  all 
CR  patients  will  eventually  relapse.  Thus,  postremission  therapy 
is designed to eradicate residual (typically undetectable) leukemic 
cells to prevent relapse and prolong survival. As with induction, the 
type of postremission therapy in AML is selected for each individ-
ual patient based on age, fitness, and cytogenetic/molecular risk.

The  choice  between  consolidation  with  chemotherapy  or  with 
transplantation  is  complex  and  based  on  age,  risk,  and  practical 
considerations. In younger patients receiving chemotherapy, postre-
mission therapy with intermediate- or high-dose cytarabine for two 
to four cycles is standard practice. Higher doses of cytarabine during 
postremission  therapy  appear  more  effective  than  standard  doses 
(such as are used in induction) for those who do not have adverse-
risk genetics. Recent studies suggest that the long-standing practice 
of high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2, every 12 h on days 1, 3, and 5) may 
not  improve  survival  over  intermediate-dose  cytarabine  (IDAC; 
1–1.5  g/m2)  for  such  patients.  Thus,  the  ELN  has  recommended 
IDAC at 1–1.5 g/m2, every 12 h, on days 1–3, as the optimal postrem-
ission chemotherapy approach for favorable- and intermediate-risk 
younger patients, for two to four cycles. While high-dose cytarabine 
may not be necessary, it is important to note that younger, favorable- 
risk  patients  have  worse  outcomes  when  doses  <1  g/m2  are  used. 
In  contrast  to  favorable-risk  patients,  intermediate-  or  adverse-
risk  patients  should  proceed  with  allogeneic  HCT  in  CR1  when 
feasible  (see  transplant  discussion  below).  Because  older  patients 
have  increased  toxicities  with  higher  doses  of  cytarabine,  ELN 
recommends  relatively  attenuated  cytarabine  doses  (0.5–1  g/m2,   
every 12 h, on days 1–3) in favorable-risk older patients. There is no 

clear  value  for  intensive  postremission  therapy  in  non–favorable- 
risk older patients; allogeneic HCT in CR1 (up to age 75 years) or 
investigational  postremission  therapy  is  recommended.  Indeed, 
postremission therapy is an appropriate setting for introduction of 
new agents in both older and younger patients (Table 104-6).

For patients treated initially with lower intensity regimens that 
include  venetoclax,  the  current  practice  is  to  continue  repetitive 
cycles of the same combination of agents after remission until dis-
ease progression. Therapy often must be abbreviated over time due 
to cumulative myelotoxicity.

Allogeneic HCT is the best relapse-prevention strategy currently 
available  for  AML.  Allogeneic  HCT  is  probably  best  understood 
as  an  opportunity  for  immunotherapy;  residual  leukemia  cells 
potentially  elicit  an  immunologic  response  from  donor  immune 
cells, the so-called graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The benefit 
of GVL in relapse risk reduction, unfortunately, is offset somewhat 
by increased morbidity and mortality from complications of allo-
geneic  HCT  including  graft-versus-host  disease  (GVHD).  Given 
that relapsed AML is typically resistant to chemotherapy, allogeneic 
HCT in CR1 (e.g., before relapse ever occurs) is a favored strategy. 
We have often explained to patients that transplant can effectively 
“eliminate  the  needle  in  a  haystack,  but  not  a  stack  of  needles.” 
Transplant is recommended for patients age <75 years who do not 
have favorable-risk disease and who have an HLA-matched donor 
(related or unrelated). We also recommend allogeneic HCT in CR1 
for patients with intermediate-risk disease (Table 104-3). However, 
considerable  debate  exists  regarding  whether  allogeneic  HCT  in 
CR1  is  a  requirement  for  younger  patients  with  intermediate-risk 
AML,  as  one  large  series  from  the  Medical  Research  Council 
reported  that  such  patients  have  similar  outcomes  if  transplanted 
only  after  relapse  (and  achievement  of  CR2),  sparing  some  the 
long-term morbidity of transplantation. That said, allogeneic HCT 
is generally recommended as soon as possible after CR1 is achieved 
unless the patient is in a favorable-risk group. Increasingly, patients 
without HLA-matched donors are considered for alternative donor 
transplants (e.g., HLA-mismatched unrelated, haploidentical related, 
and  umbilical  cord  blood)  even  in  CR1.  More  effective  and  safe 
methods of in vivo T-cell depletion (i.e., posttransplant cyclophos-
phamide  following  mismatched  transplantation)  have  broadened 
the availability of potential allogeneic HCT donors. Now, virtually 
any patient with a healthy parent or child (i.e., haploidentical) has 
an  available  donor  suitable  for  allogeneic  HCT  if  desired.  Long-
term outcomes with conventional chemotherapy for older patients 
are dismal; transplantation for such patients is expanding. Even for 
older patients, nonrandomized data demonstrate curative potential 
for older patients in CR1 treated with reduced-intensity condition-
ing regimens and allogeneic HCT.

Trials  comparing  allogeneic  HCT  with  intensive  chemotherapy 
or  autologous  HCT  have  shown  improved  duration  of  remission 
with allogeneic HCT. However, the relapse risk reduction observed 
with  allogeneic  HCT  is  partially  offset  by  the  increase  in  fatal   
treatment-related  toxicity  (GVHD,  organ  toxicity).  Despite  this, 
there  is  no  debate  that  patients  with  adverse-risk  AML  have 
improved  long-term  survival  with  early  allogeneic  HCT.  Alter-
natively,  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  autologous  HCT  rescue 
is  another  postremission  approach  in  non–adverse-risk  subsets. 
Autologous  HCT  patients  receive  their  own  stem  cells  (collected 
during  remission  and  cryopreserved),  following  administration 
of  myeloablative  chemotherapy.  The  toxicity  is  relatively  low 
with  autologous  HCT  (5%  mortality  rate),  but  the  relapse  rate  is 
higher  than  with  allogeneic  HCT  due  to  the  absence  of  the  GVL 
effect. Favorable- and intermediate-risk patients may benefit from 
autologous  HCT  more  so  than  adverse-risk  patients.  Practically 
speaking,  however,  autologous  HCT  in  AML  patients  is  less  fre-
quently employed currently due to enhanced relapse risk reduction 
seen  with  allogeneic  HCT  and  the  growing  availability  of  HLA- 
mismatched donors (in novel transplantation approaches).

Prognostic  factors  help  to  select  the  appropriate  postremission 
therapy in patients in CR1. Our approach includes allogeneic HCT

in  CR1  for  patients  without  favorable  cytogenetics  or  genotype. 
Patients  with  adverse-risk  disease  should  proceed  to  allogeneic 
HCT  at  CR1  if  possible.  The  decision  for  allogeneic  HCT  for 
younger intermediate-risk patients is complex and individualized as 
described above; we recommend it when an HLA-matched donor 
is  available.  Subsets  of  patients  may  benefit  from  targeted  ther-
apy  given  during  remission;  emerging  data  demonstrate  survival 
benefit from incorporation of the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin, for 
example,  into  induction  and  postremission  therapies  for  patients 
with FLT3-mutated AML. Allogeneic transplantation in CR1 is still 
recommended for these patients.

For  patients  in  morphologic  CR,  measurement  of  MRD 
remains  a  very  important  and  challenging  research  area.  Cyto-
genetics  are  a  mainstay  of  disease  assessment,  and  persistence 
of  abnormal  karyotype  (in  spite  of  morphologic  CR)  is  clearly 
associated  with  poor  clinical  outcomes.  Immunophenotyping  to 
detect  minute  populations  of  blasts  or  sensitive  molecular  assays 
(e.g.,  reverse  transcriptase  polymerase  chain  reaction  [RT-PCR]) 
to  detect  AML-associated  molecular  abnormalities  (e.g.,  NPM1, 
RUNX1/RUNX1T1  and  CBFB/MYH11  transcripts,  PML/RARA) 
can be performed to assess whether MRD is present at sequential 
time  points  during  or  after  treatment.  Whether  emerging  next- 
generation sequencing or serial quantitative assessment using flow 
or RT-PCR, performed during remission, can effectively direct suc-
cessful subsequent therapy and improve clinical outcome remains 
to  be  determined.  Currently,  no  consensus  exists  for  the  optimal 
MRD  measurement  technique  or  its  application,  although  it  is 
increasingly employed in clinical practice. Data suggest that MRD 
measurement  can  in  some  settings  be  a  reliable  discriminator 
between patients who will continue in CR or relapse, but whether 
subsequent  therapy  (i.e.,  allogeneic  HCT  or  additional  therapy) 
can  effectively  eradicate  disease  in  such  patients  is  not  yet  clear. 
However, in the subset of patients with APL, serial RT-PCR (for the 
PML/RARA transcript) is a very useful and reliable tool to detect 
early  relapse  and  to  direct  initiation  of  reinduction  therapy  prior 
to  onset  of  overt  relapse.  Critical  in  the  general  understanding  of 
MRD in all disease subsets is the recognition that even patients with 
undetectable levels of MRD remain at risk for leukemic relapse. 

SUPPORTIVE CARE
Measures  geared  to  supporting  patients  through  several  weeks  of 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are critical to successful AML 
therapy. Patients with AML should be treated in centers expert in 
providing  supportive  care.  Multi-lumen  central  venous  catheters 
should be inserted as soon as newly diagnosed AML patients have 
been stabilized. They should be used thereafter for administration 
of intravenous medications/chemotherapy and transfusions, as well 
as  for  blood  drawing  instead  of  venipuncture  during  prolonged 
periods of myelosuppression.

Adequate and prompt blood bank support is critical to therapy 
of AML. Platelet transfusions should be given as needed to main-
tain a platelet count ≥10,000/μL. The platelet count should be kept 
at  higher  levels  in  febrile  patients  and  during  episodes  of  active 
bleeding or DIC. Patients with poor posttransfusion platelet count 
increments  may  benefit  from  administration  of  ABO-matched 
platelets or platelets from HLA-matched donors. RBC transfusions 
should  be  considered  to  keep  the  hemoglobin  level  >70–80  g/L   
(7–8 g/dL) in the absence of active bleeding, DIC, or congestive heart 
failure,  which  require  higher  hemoglobin  levels.  Blood  products 
leukodepleted  by  filtration  should  be  used  to  avert  or  delay  allo-
immunization as well as febrile reactions. Blood products may also 
be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD. Cytomega-
lovirus (CMV)-negative blood products should be used for CMV- 
seronegative  patients  who  are  potential  candidates  for  allogeneic 
HCT;  fortunately,  white  blood  cell  filtration  is  quite  effective  at 
reducing CMV exposure as well.

Neutropenia  (neutrophils  <500/μL  or  <1000/μL  and  predicted 
to decline to <500/μL over the next 48 h) can be part of the initial 
presentation and/or a side effect of the chemotherapy treatment in 

AML  patients.  Thus,  infectious  complications  remain  the  major 
cause of morbidity and death during induction and postremission 
chemotherapy  for  AML.  Antibacterial  (i.e.,  quinolones)  and  anti-
fungal  (i.e.,  posaconazole)  prophylaxis,  especially  in  conjunction 
with regimens that cause mucositis, is beneficial. For patients who 
are  herpes  simplex  virus  or  varicella-zoster  seropositive,  antiviral 
prophylaxis should be initiated (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir).

Fever  develops  in  most  patients  with  AML,  but  infections  are 
documented  in  only  half  of  febrile  patients.  Early  initiation  of 
empirical  broad-spectrum  antibacterial  and  antifungal  antibiotics 
has  significantly  reduced  the  number  of  patients  dying  of  infec-
tious  complications  (Chap.  74).  An  antibiotic  regimen  adequate  to 
treat  gram-negative  organisms  should  be  instituted  at  the  onset  of 
fever  in  a  neutropenic  patient  after  clinical  evaluation,  including 
a  detailed  physical  examination  with  inspection  of  the  indwelling 
catheter exit site and a perirectal examination (for perirectal abscess), 
as  well  as  procurement  of  cultures  and  radiographs  aimed  at  doc-
umenting  the  source  of  fever.  Specific  antibiotic  regimens  should 
be  based  on  institutional  antibiotic  sensitivity  data  obtained  from 
where  the  patient  is  being  treated.  Acceptable  regimens  for  empiric 
antibiotic  therapy  include  monotherapy  with  imipenem-cilastatin, 
meropenem,  piperacillin/tazobactam,  or  an  extended-spectrum 
antipseudomonal  cephalosporin  (cefepime  or  ceftazidime).  The 
combination of an aminoglycoside with an antipseudomonal peni-
cillin (e.g., piperacillin) or an aminoglycoside in combination with 
an  extended-spectrum  antipseudomonal  cephalosporin  should 
be  considered  in  complicated  or  resistant  cases.  Aminoglycosides 
should be avoided, if possible, in patients with renal insufficiency. 
Empirical  vancomycin  should  be  added  in  neutropenic  patients 
with  catheter-related  infections,  blood  cultures  positive  for  gram- 
positive  bacteria  before  final  identification  and  susceptibility  test-
ing, hypotension or shock, or known colonization with penicillin/ 
cephalosporin-resistant  pneumococci  or  methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus  aureus.  In  special  situations  where  decreased  sus-
ceptibility to vancomycin, vancomycin-resistant organisms, or van-
comycin toxicity is documented, other options including linezolid 
and daptomycin need to be considered.

Caspofungin  (or  a  similar  echinocandin),  voriconazole,  isavu-
conazonium,  or  liposomal  amphotericin  B  should  be  considered 
for  antifungal  treatment  if  fever  persists  for  4–7  days  following 
initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy. Although liposomal formu-
lations of amphotericin B have improved the toxicity profile of this 
agent, use has been limited to situations with high risk of or docu-
mented mold infections, especially in those in whom an azole fails. 
Caspofungin has been approved for empiric antifungal treatment. 
Voriconazole has also been shown to be equivalent in efficacy and 
less toxic than amphotericin B; isavuconazonium may also be effec-
tive with fewer drug-drug interactions. Antibacterial and antifungal 
antibiotics should be continued until patients are no longer neutro-
penic, regardless of whether a specific source has been found for the 
fever. Unfortunately, this practice likely contributes to development 
of resistance and increased incidence of nosocomial infections such 
as Clostridium difficile colitis, so great care should be taken prefer-
ably in hospital-wide antibiotic surveillance and isolation strategies 
to reduce these complications. Recombinant hematopoietic growth 
factors have a limited role in AML; myeloid growth factors may be 
useful  in  the  postremission  setting  but  are  not  recommended  in 
induction or for “palliative” care for patients not in remission. 

TREATMENT FOR REFRACTORY OR RELAPSED AML
In patients who relapse after achieving CR, the length of first CR is 
predictive of response to salvage chemotherapy treatment; patients 
with  longer  first  CR  (>12  months)  generally  relapse  with  drug- 
sensitive disease and have a higher chance of attaining a CR, even 
with  the  same  chemotherapeutic  agents  used  for  first  remission 
induction.  Patients  with  short  prior  CR  duration  are  at  high  risk 
for  treatment  failure.  Similar  to  patients  with  refractory  disease, 
patients  with  relapsed  disease  are  rarely  cured  by  salvage  che-
motherapy  treatments  alone.  Therefore,  patients  who  eventually

achieve a second CR and are eligible for allogeneic HCT should be 
transplanted. For patients who relapse after allogeneic HCT, no con-
sensus for best therapy exists; outcomes in this setting are very poor.
Because achievement of a second CR with routine salvage ther-
apies  is  relatively  uncommon,  especially  in  patients  who  relapse 
rapidly after achievement of first CR (<12 months), these patients 
and  those  lacking  HLA-compatible  donors  or  who  are  not  can-
didates  for  allogeneic  HCT  should  be  considered  for  innovative 
approaches on clinical trials. Many new agents are in current testing  
(Table 104-6). The discovery of novel gene mutations and mecha-
nisms of leukemogenesis that might represent actionable therapeu-
tic  targets  has  prompted  the  development  of  many  new  targeting 
agents.  In  addition  to  kinase  inhibitors  for  FLT3-mutated  AML, 
other compounds targeting the aberrant activity of mutant proteins 
(e.g., IDH1/2 inhibitors) and numerous other biologic mechanisms 
are  being  tested  in  clinical  trials.  Inhibitors  of  FLT3  (gilteritinib), 
IDH1  (ivosidenib),  or  IDH2  (enasidenib)  are  monotherapies  for 
relapsed  AML  patients  who  have  targetable  mutations.  Further-
more,  approaches  with  antibodies  targeting  markers  commonly 
expressed  on  leukemia  blasts  (e.g.,  CD33)  or  leukemia-initiating 
cells  (e.g.,  CD123)  are  also  under  investigation.  Once  these  com-
pounds  have  demonstrated  safety  and  activity  as  single  agents, 
investigation of combinations with other molecular targeting com-
pounds and/or chemotherapy should be pursued. 

TREATMENT OF ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA
APL is a highly curable AML subtype, and ∼85% of these patients 
achieve long-term survival with current approaches. APL has long 
been shown to be responsive to cytarabine and daunorubicin, but in 
the past, patients who were treated with these drugs alone frequently 
died from DIC induced by the release of granule components by the 
chemotherapy-treated  leukemia  cells.  However,  the  prognosis  of 
APL  patients  has  changed  dramatically  with  the  introduction  of 
tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid [ATRA]), an oral drug that induces 
the  differentiation  of  leukemic  cells  bearing  the  t(15;17),  where 
disruption  of  the  RARA  gene  encoding  a  retinoid  acid  receptor 
occurs. ATRA decreases the frequency of DIC but often produces 
another  complication  called  the  APL  (differentiation)  syndrome. 
Occurring within the first 3 weeks of treatment, it is characterized 
by fever, fluid retention, dyspnea, chest pain, pulmonary infiltrates, 
pleural  and  pericardial  effusions,  and  hypoxemia.  The  syndrome 
is  related  to  adhesion  of  differentiated  neoplastic  cells  to  the  pul-
monary  vasculature  endothelium.  Glucocorticoids,  chemotherapy 
for cytoreduction, and/or supportive measures can be effective for 
management of the APL syndrome. Temporary discontinuation of 
ATRA is necessary in cases of severe APL syndrome (i.e., patients 
developing  renal  failure  or  requiring  admission  to  the  intensive 
care  unit  due  to  respiratory  distress).  The  mortality  rate  of  this 
syndrome is ∼10%. APL syndrome may also occur, less commonly, 
with arsenic trioxide (ATO) in APL.

In  adults  with  low-risk  APL  (low  leukocyte  count  at  presenta-
tion), ATRA (45 mg/m2/d) plus ATO (0.15 mg/kg/d) was recently 
compared  to  ATRA  plus  concurrent  idarubicin  chemotherapy. 
ATRA/ATO  was  superior  and  is  the  new  standard  of  care  for 
such  patients.  CR  rates  in  low-risk  disease  approach  100%,  with 
excellent long-term survival. Notably, patients with high-risk APL 
(defined as leukocyte count >10,000/μL) must be uniquely treated, 
as they require immediate cytoreduction with chemotherapy due to 
life-threatening APL syndrome and rapidly rising leukocyte count 
after initiation of ATRA. High-risk patients are at increased risk for 
induction death due to this syndrome as well as increased frequency 
of hemorrhagic complications (related to DIC).

Assessment of residual disease by RT-PCR amplification of the 
t(15;17)  chimeric  gene  product  PML-RARA  following  the  final 
cycle  of  treatment  is  important.  Disappearance  of  the  signal  is 
associated  with  long-term  disease-free  survival;  its  persistence  or 
reemergence  invariably  predicts  relapse.  Sequential  monitoring  of 
RT-PCR for PML-RARA is now considered standard for postremis-
sion monitoring of APL, at least in high-risk patients.

Patients in molecular, cytogenetic, or clinical relapse should be 
salvaged  with  ATO  with  or  without  ATRA;  in  patients  who  were 
treated  with  ATRA  plus  chemotherapy  in  the  front-line  setting, 
ATO-based  therapy  at  relapse  produces  meaningful  responses  in 
up  to  85%  of  patients.  Although  experience  with  relapsed  APL 
in  patients  who  received  ATO  during  initial  induction  is  limited 
(given that few relapses occur in low-risk patients and widespread 
use  of  ATO  during  first-line  therapy  is  relatively  new),  ATO 
remains the preferred reinduction therapy for patients who relapse, 
although the duration of prior remission should be a factor in this 
choice.  Achievement  of  CR2  should  be  followed  by  consolidation 
with autologous HCT (for patients who achieve RT-PCR-negative 
status).  In  the  minority  who  do  not  achieve  negative  RT-PCR  or 
who relapse again, allogeneic HCT may still be potentially curative.

105 Chronic Myeloid  
Leukemia
Hagop Kantarjian, Elias Jabbour, Jorge Cortes

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic myelopro-
liferative stem cell neoplasm. The disease is driven by the BCR/ABL1 
chimeric  gene  that  codes  for  a  constitutively  active  tyrosine  kinase, 
resulting  from  a  reciprocal  balanced  translocation  between  the  long 
arms  of  chromosomes  9  and  22,  t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2),  known  as  the

FIGURE 105-1  A. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome cytogenetic abnormality. B. Breakpoints in the long arms of chromosome 9 (ABL1 locus) and chromosome 22 (BCR 
regions) result in at least three different BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein messages, p210BCR-ABL1 (most common message in chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]), p190BCR-ABL1 (present 
in  two-thirds  of  patients  with  Ph-positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia;  rare  in  CML),  and  p230BCR-ABL1  (rare  in  CML  and  associated  with  an  indolent  course).  Other 
rearrangements (e.g., e14a3, e14a3) are less common. (© 2013 The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.)

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) (Fig. 105-1). Untreated, the course of 
CML is typically biphasic or triphasic, with an early indolent or chronic 
phase,  followed  often  by  an  accelerated  phase  and  a  terminal  blastic 
phase. Before the era of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), 
the median survival in CML was 3–7 years, and the 10-year survival 
rate was 30% or less. Introduced into standard CML therapy in 2000, 
TKIs have revolutionized the treatment, natural history, and progno-
sis  of  CML.  Today,  the  estimated  10-year  survival  rate  with  imatinib 
mesylate, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI approved, is greater than 85% and 
approaches that of the general population. Allogeneic stem cell trans-
plantation (SCT), a curative approach but one that involves more risks, 
is now offered as second- or third-line therapy after failure of TKIs.

 ■ INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
CML  accounts  for  ∼15%  of  all  cases  of  leukemia.  There  is  a  slight 
male  predominance  (male-to-female  ratio  1.6:1).  The  median  age 
at  diagnosis  is  55–65  years.  It  is  uncommon  in  children;  only  3%  of 
patients with CML are younger than 20 years, although in recent years, 
a  higher  proportion  of  young  patients  are  diagnosed.  The  incidence 
of  CML  increases  gradually  with  age,  with  a  steeper  increase  after 
the age of 40–50 years. The annual incidence of CML is 1.6 cases per 
100,000  individuals.  In  the  United  States,  this  translates  into  about 
8500–9000 new cases per year. The incidence of CML has not changed 

over several decades. By extrapolation, the worldwide annual incidence 
of CML is about 200,000 cases. With a median survival of 3–6 years 
before 2000, the disease prevalence in the United States was ~30,000 
cases. With TKI therapy, the annual mortality has been reduced from 
10–20% to about 2%. Therefore, the prevalence of CML is expected to  
continue  to  increase.  Based  on  an  estimated  annual  mortality  of  2% 
and an incidence of 8500 cases per year, the plateau prevalence of CML 
is  estimated  to  be  reached  at  ~425,000  in  the  United  Stated  (8500  × 
100/2)  by  about  2040,  with  full  TKI  optimal  treatment  penetration. 
The  worldwide  prevalence  will  depend  on  the  treatment  penetration 
of TKIs and their effect on reduction of worldwide annual mortality. 
Ideally, with full TKI treatment penetration, the worldwide prevalence 
should  plateau  at  35  times  the  incidence,  or  ~9–10  million  patients. 
These estimates are all based on extrapolations from the incidence and 
prevalence of CML in the United States, as well as an estimated annual 
mortality of 2% with modern TKI therapy; they could vary consider-
ably if the estimates were to change.

 ■ ETIOLOGY
There are no familial associations in CML. The risk of developing CML 
is not increased in monozygotic twins or in relatives of patients with 
CML. No etiologic agents are incriminated, and no associations exist 
with exposures to benzene or other toxins, fertilizers, insecticides, or

viruses. CML is not a frequent secondary leukemia following therapy 
of  other  cancers  with  alkylating  agents  and/or  radiation.  Exposure 
to  ionizing  radiation  (e.g.,  nuclear  accidents,  radiation  treatment  for 
ankylosing  spondylitis  or  cervical  cancer)  has  increased  the  risk  of 
CML, which peaks at 5–10 years after exposure and is dose-related. The 
median time to development of CML among atomic bomb survivors 
was  6.3  years.  Following  the  Chernobyl  accident,  no  increase  in  the 
incidence of CML was reported, suggesting that larger dose exposures 
of radiation are required to cause CML. Because of adequate protec-
tion, the risk of CML has not increased among individuals working in 
the nuclear industry or among radiologists.

 ■ PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The  t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)  is  present  in  >90%  of  classical  CML  cases. 
It  results  from  a  balanced  reciprocal  translocation  between  the  long 
arms  of  chromosomes  9  and  22.  It  is  present  in  hematopoietic  cells 
(myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytes, and monocytes; less often mature 
B  lymphocytes;  rarely  mature  T  lymphocytes,  but  not  stromal  cells), 
but  not  in  other  cells  in  the  human  body.  As  a  result  of  the  genetic 
translocation,  DNA  sequences  from  the  cellular  oncogene  ABL1  are 
juxtaposed to the major breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chro-
mosome 22, generating a hybrid oncogene, BCR/ABL1. Depending on 
the breakpoint site in the major BCR region on chromosome 22 (e13 
or e14), two main messenger RNA transcripts occur, e13a2 (previously 
b2a2)  and  e14a2  (previously  b3a2).  Both  of  them  encode  for  a  novel 
oncoprotein  of  molecular  weight  210  kDa,  referred  to  as  p210BCR-ABL1 
(Fig.  105-1B).  This  oncoprotein  exhibits  constitutive  kinase  activity 
that  leads  to  excessive  proliferation  and  reduced  apoptosis  of  CML 
cells,  endowing  them  with  a  growth  advantage  over  their  normal 
counterparts.  Over  time,  normal  hematopoiesis  is  suppressed,  but 
normal stem cells can persist and reemerge following effective therapy, 
for  example  with  TKIs.  In  most  instances  of  Ph-positive  acute  lym-
phoblastic  leukemia (ALL) and in rare cases of CML, the breakpoint 
in BCR is more centromeric, in a region called the minor BCR region 
(mBCR). As a result, a shorter sequence of BCR is fused to ABL1, with 
a  consequent  e1a2  transcript  and  a  smaller  BCR-ABL1  oncoprotein, 
p190BCR-ABL1.  When  occurring  in  Ph-positive  CML,  this  translocation 
is associated with a worse outcome. A rarer breakpoint in BCR occurs 
telomeric to the major BCR region in the micro-BCR (μ-BCR) region. It 
juxtaposes a larger fragment of the BCR gene to ABL1 and produces an 
e19a2 transcript and a larger p230BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein (associated with a 
more indolent CML course). Other rearrangements (based on different 
breakpoints in the ABL region), such as e13a3 or e14a3 (also resulting 
in  a  p210BCR-ABL1  oncoprotein),  occur  much  less  frequently.  These  are 
not  readily  identifiable  nor  quantifiable  with  the  routine  polymerase 
chain  reaction  (PCR)  probes,  thus  producing  falsely  negative  PCR 
levels on follow-up studies if not tested at diagnosis.

The constitutive activation of BCR/ABL1 results in autophosphory-
lation and activation of multiple downstream pathways that affect gene 
transcription,  apoptosis,  stromal  adherence,  skeletal  organization,  and 
degradation of inhibitory proteins. These transduction pathways involve 
RAS,  mitogen-activated  protein  (MAP)  kinases,  signal  transducers 
and  activators  of  transcription  (STAT),  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase 
(PI3k),  MYC,  and  others.  These  interactions  are  mostly  mediated 
through tyrosine phosphorylation and require binding of BCR-ABL1 
to adapter proteins such as GRB-2, CRK, CRK-like (CRK-L) protein, 
and Src homology containing proteins (SHC). Most BCR-ABL1 TKIs 
bind  to  the  BCR-ABL1  ATP-binding  domain,  inhibiting  its  kinase 
activity,  preventing  the  activation  of  transformation  pathways,  and 
inhibiting  downstream  signaling.  As  a  result,  proliferation  of  CML 
cells is inhibited and apoptosis induced, allowing the reemergence of 
normal hematopoiesis. An additional layer of complexity is related to 
differences  in  signal  transduction  between  CML-differentiated  cells 
and  early  progenitors.  Beta-catenin,  Wnt1,  Foxo3a,  transforming 
growth  factor  β,  interleukin-6,  PP2A,  SIRT1,  and  others  have  been 
implicated in CML stem cell survival. ABL1 also has a myristoyl site 
that  functions  as  a  negative  regulator  of  its  kinase  activity.  This  site 
and  its  negative  regulatory  activity  are  lost  upon  fusion  with  BCR. 
Novel  ABL1  inhibitors  (e.g.,  asciminib)  bind  this  myristoyl  site 

and  restore  the  lost  inhibitory  activity.  Mutations  in  other  cancer- 
associated genes may also occur at diagnosis, most frequently in ASXL1, 
IKZF1, and RUNX1; their presence is associated with worse response to 
therapy and a higher risk of transformation to blastic phase.

Experimental  models  have  established  the  causal  relationship 
between the BCR/ABL1 rearrangement and the development of CML. 
In  animal  models,  expression  of  BCR/ABL1  in  normal  hematopoietic 
cells produced CML-like disorders or lymphoid leukemia, demonstrat-
ing  the  leukemogenic  potential  of  BCR/ABL1  as  a  single  oncogenic 
abnormality. Other models, however, suggest the need for a “second hit.”
The cause of the BCR/ABL1 rearrangement is unknown. Molecular 
techniques  that  detect  BCR/ABL1  at  a  level  of  1  in  108  cells  identify 
this molecular abnormality in the blood of up to 25% of normal adults 
and  5%  of  infants,  but  0%  of  cord  blood  samples.  This  suggests  that 
BCR/ABL1 is not sufficient to cause overt CML in the overwhelming 
majority of individuals in whom it occurs. Because CML develops in 
only 1.6 of 100,000 individuals annually, additional molecular events 
or poor immune recognition of the rearranged cells may contribute to 
overt CML.

CML  is  defined  by  the  presence  of  the  BCR/ABL1  fusion  gene  in  a 
patient with a myeloproliferative neoplasm. In some patients with a typ-
ical morphologic picture of CML, the Ph chromosome is not detectable 
by standard G-banding karyotype, but fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) and/or molecular studies (PCR) detect BCR/ABL1. These patients 
have a course similar to patients with Ph-positive CML and respond to 
TKI therapy. Many of the remaining patients have atypical morphologic 
or clinical features and have other diseases, such as atypical CML, chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neo-
plasms (MDS/MPN). These individuals do not respond to TKI therapy 
and  usually  have  a  poor  prognosis  with  a  median  survival  of  about  
2–3 years. Detection of mutations in the granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor  receptor  (CSF3R)  in  chronic  neutrophilic  leukemia  (80%  of 
cases) and in some cases of atypical CML (5–10% of cases), mutations 
in  SETBP1  in  atypical  CML  (25%  of  cases),  and  mutations  in  SF3B1 
in  MDS/MPN  with  ringed  sideroblasts  and  marked  thrombocytosis 
(MDS/MPN-RS-T;  50–70%  of  cases,  associated  with  longer  median 
survival  of  7  years  vs  3.3  years  with  wild-type  SF3B1)  supports  the 
notion that these are distinct molecular and biologic entities. Patients 
with  chronic  neutrophilic  leukemia  or  atypical  CML  whose  disease 
is  associated  with  CSF3R  mutation  may  respond  well  to  ruxolitinib 
(a  JAK2  inhibitor)  therapy  (complete  response  in  50–60%  of  such 
patients).

The  events  associated  with  the  transition  of  CML  from  a  chronic 
to  accelerated-blastic  phase  are  poorly  understood.  Characteristic 
chromosomal  abnormalities  such  as  a  double  Ph,  trisomy  8,  isoch-
romosome 17 or deletion of 17p (loss of TP53), 20q–, translocations 
involving  3q26,  and  others  may  be  seen  with  disease  acceleration. 
Molecular  events  associated  with  transformation  include  mutations 
in  TP53,  retinoblastoma  1  (RB1),  myeloid  transcriptions  factors  like 
RUNX1, and cell cycle regulators like p16. A plethora of other muta-
tions or functional abnormalities have been implicated in blastic trans-
formation, but no unifying theme has emerged other than the fact that 
BCR/ABL1 itself induces genetic instability that favors the acquisition 
of additional molecular defects and eventually results in blastic trans-
formation. One critical effect of TKIs is to stabilize the CML genome, 
leading to a reduced transformation rate. In particular, the previously 
observed sudden blastic transformations (i.e., abrupt transformation to 
blastic phase in a patient who had been in cytogenetic response) have 
become uncommon, occurring rarely in younger patients in the first 
1–2 years of TKI therapy (usually sudden lymphoid blastic transforma-
tions). Sudden transformations beyond the third year of TKI therapy 
are rare in patients who continue on TKI therapy. Moreover, the course 
of CML is now frequently more indolent in patients treated with TKI, 
even without cytogenetic response, compared to previous experience 
with  hydroxyurea/busulfan,  suggesting  a  definite  clinical  benefit  of 
continued inhibition of the kinase activity.

Among  patients  developing  resistance  to  TKIs,  several  resistance 
mechanisms have been observed. The most clinically relevant one is the 
development of ABL1 kinase domain mutations that may prevent the 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   820

21/01/22   3:51 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologybinding of TKIs to the catalytic site (ATP-binding site) of the kinase or 
maintain the kinase activity despite the presence of a TKI. More than 100 
ABL1 kinase domain mutations have now been described, many of which 
confer relative or absolute resistance to imatinib. Consequently, second- 
generation  (i.e.,  dasatinib,  nilotinib,  bosutinib)  and  third-generation 
(ponatinib)  TKIs  were  developed,  the  latter  with  significant  efficacy 
against  T315I,  a  “gatekeeper”  mutation  that  prevents  binding  of  and 
causes  resistance  to  all  other  currently  available  TKIs.  Asciminib,  
olverembatinib (HQP1351) and other novel TKIs under development 
are also active against the T315I mutation.

 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION
The presenting signs and symptoms in CML depend on the availabil-
ity of and access to health care, including physical examinations and 
screening  tests.  In  the  United  States,  because  of  the  wider  access  to 
health  care  screening  and  physical  examinations,  50–60%  of  patients 
are diagnosed on routine blood tests and have minimal symptoms at 
presentation, such as fatigue. In geographic locations where access to 
health care is more limited, patients often present with high CML bur-
den including splenomegaly, anemia, and related symptoms (abdom-
inal pain, weight loss, fatigue), associated with a higher frequency of 
high-risk CML. Presenting findings in patients diagnosed in the United 
States are shown in Table 105-1.

Symptoms  Most patients with CML (90%) present in the indolent 
or chronic phase. Depending on the timing of diagnosis, patients are 
often asymptomatic (if the diagnosis is discovered during health care 
screening  tests).  Common  symptoms,  when  present,  are  manifesta-
tions of anemia and splenomegaly. These may include fatigue, malaise, 
weight loss (if high leukemia burden), or early satiety and left upper 
quadrant  pain  or  masses  (from  splenomegaly).  Less  common  pre-
senting  findings  include  thrombotic  or  hyperviscosity-related  events 
from severe leukocytosis or thrombocytosis. These include priapism, 
cardiovascular complications, myocardial infarction, venous thrombo-
sis, visual disturbances, dyspnea and pulmonary insufficiency, drows-
iness,  loss  of  coordination,  confusion,  or  cerebrovascular  accidents.

Physical  Findings  Splenomegaly  is  the  most  common  physical 
finding,  occurring  in  20–70%  of  patients  depending  on  health  care 
screening frequency. Other less common findings include hepatomeg-
aly  (5–10%),  lymphadenopathy  (5–10%),  and  extramedullary  disease 
(skin  or  subcutaneous  lesions).  The  latter  indicates  CML  transfor-
mation  if  a  biopsy  confirms  predominance  of  blasts.  Other  physical 
findings  are  manifestations  of  complications  of  high  tumor  burden 
described earlier (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, bleeding). High 
basophil  counts  may  be  associated  with  histamine  overproduction 
causing pruritus, diarrhea, flushing, and even gastrointestinal ulcers.

Hematologic and Marrow Findings 
In untreated CML, leuko-
cytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood 
differential  shows  left-shifted  hematopoiesis  with  predominance  of 
neutrophils  and  the  presence  of  bands,  myelocytes,  metamyelocytes, 
promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils 
are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocy-
topenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease 
acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of 
patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 10–20% of patients 
without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte 
alkaline  phosphatase  score  and  high  levels  of  vitamin  B12,  uric  acid, 
lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and 
sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a 
marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.

The bone marrow is hypercellular with marked myeloid hyperpla-
sia  and  a  high  myeloid-to-erythroid  ratio  of  15–20:1.  Marrow  blasts 
are  typically  5%  or  less;  when  higher,  they  carry  a  worse  prognosis 
or  represent  transformation  to  accelerated  phase  (if  they  are  ≥15%). 
Increased  reticulin  fibrosis  (detected  with  silver  stain)  is  common, 
with  30–40%  of  patients  demonstrating  grade  3–4  reticulin  fibrosis. 
This  was  considered  adverse  in  the  pre-TKI  era.  With  TKI  therapy, 
reticulin  fibrosis  resolves  in  most  patients  and  is  not  an  indicator  of 
poor  prognosis.  Collagen  fibrosis  (Wright-Giemsa  stain)  is  rare  at 
diagnosis.  Disease  progression  with  a  “spent  phase”  of  myelofibrosis 
(myelophthisis,  or  burnt-out  marrow)  was  a  relatively  common  end-
stage CML condition with busulfan therapy (20–30%); it is extremely 
rare now with TKI therapy.

Cytogenetic and Molecular Findings  The diagnosis of CML is 
straightforward and depends on documenting the t(9;22) (q34.1;q11.2), 
which is identified by G-banding in 90% of cases. This is known as the 
Philadelphia chromosome (initially identified in Philadelphia as a minute 
chromosome, later identified to be chromosome 22) (Fig. 105-1). Some 
patients  (~10%)  may  have  complex  translocations  (complex  variant 
Ph) involving three or more chromosomes including chromosomes 9 
and 22 and one or more additional chromosomes. Others may have a 
“masked  Ph,”  involving  translocations  between  chromosome  9  and  a 
chromosome other than 22 (but molecularly showing the BCR/ABL1 
rearrangement; known as simple variant Ph). The prognosis of these 
patients  and  their  response  to  TKI  therapy  are  similar  to  those  in 
patients with Ph. About 5–10% of patients may have additional chro-
mosomal  abnormalities  (ACAs)  in  the  Ph-positive  cells  at  diagnosis. 
These  usually  involve  trisomy  8,  a  double  Ph,  isochromosome  17  or 
17p deletion, 20q–, or others. This is referred to as cytogenetic clonal 
evolution and was historically a sign of adverse prognosis, particularly 
when  trisomy  8,  double  Ph,  or  chromosome  17  abnormalities  were 
noted.  A  less  common  abnormality  involving  chromosome  3q26.2 
occurs with disease progression and carries a poor prognosis.

Techniques such as FISH and PCR are now used to aid in the diag-
nosis of CML. They are more sensitive to estimate the CML burden in 
patients  on  TKI  therapy.  They  can  be  done  on  peripheral  blood  and 
thus are more convenient to patients. Patients with CML at diagnosis

should have a FISH analysis to quantify the percentage of Ph-positive 
cells, if FISH is used to replace marrow cytogenetic analysis in mon-
itoring  response  to  therapy.  FISH  will  not  detect  additional  chromo-
somal abnormalities (clonal evolution); thus, a cytogenetic analysis is 
recommended at the time of diagnosis. In addition, 10–15% of patients 
may  develop  chromosomal  abnormalities  in  Ph-negative  metaphases 
after responding to TKIs. These abnormalities may carry a worse prog-
nosis but are not detected by FISH unless already identified and FISH 
is  used  to  follow  them.  Molecular  studies  at  diagnosis  are  important 
to document the type and presence of BCR-ABL1 transcripts to avoid 
spurious  “undetectable”  BCR-ABL1  transcripts  on  follow-up  studies, 
with the false impression of a complete molecular response. The pres-
ence of the Philadelphia chromosome with “negative” PCR with stan-
dard methodology should prompt investigation of atypical transcripts.
Both  FISH  and  PCR  studies  can  be  falsely  positive  at  low  levels 
or  falsely  negative  because  of  technical  issues.  Therefore,  a  diagnosis 
of  CML  must  always  rely  on  a  marrow  analysis  with  routine  cytoge-
netics. The diagnostic bone marrow confirms the presence of the Ph 
chromosome,  detects  clonal  evolution,  and  quantifies  the  percentage 
of marrow blasts and basophils. In 10% of patients, the percentage of 
marrow  blasts  and  basophils  can  be  significantly  higher  than  in  the 
peripheral  blood,  conferring  poorer  prognosis  or  even  representing 
disease transformation.

Monitoring  patients  on  TKI  therapy  by  cytogenetics,  FISH,  and 
PCR  has  become  an  important  standard  practice  to  assess  response 
to  therapy,  emphasize  compliance,  evaluate  possible  treatment  resis-
tance,  identify  the  need  to  change  TKI  therapy,  and  determine  the 
need to assess for kinase domain mutations. Because of the decreasing 
reliance of bone marrow aspirations to monitor response, equivalence 
has been established to correlate cytogenetic results with PCR values. 
These are not absolute correlations but provide adequate guidance. A 
partial cytogenetic response is defined as the presence of 35% or less 
Ph-positive metaphases by routine cytogenetic analysis. This is roughly 
equivalent to BCR-ABL1 transcripts by the International Scale (IS) of 
10%  or  less.  A  complete  cytogenetic  response  refers  to  the  absence 
of  Ph-positive  metaphases  (0%  Ph  positivity).  This  is  approximately 
equivalent to BCR-ABL1 transcripts (IS) of 1% or less. A major molec-
ular  response  (MMR  or  MR3)  refers  to  BCR-ABL1  transcripts  (IS) 
≤0.1%, or roughly a 3-log or greater reduction of BCR-ABL1 transcripts 
from a standardized baseline. MR4 refers to BCR-ABL1 transcripts (IS) 
≤0.01%,  and  MR4.5  (deep  molecular  response)  refers  to  BCR-ABL1 
transcripts (IS) ≤0.0032%, roughly equivalent to a 4.5-log reduction or 
greater of transcripts.

Findings in CML Transformation  Progression of CML is usu-
ally associated with leukocytosis resistant to therapy, increasing anemia, 
fever and constitutional symptoms, and increased blasts and basophils 
in the peripheral blood or marrow. Criteria of accelerated-phase CML, 
historically associated with median survival of <1.5 years, include the 
presence  of  15%  or  more  peripheral  blasts,  30%  or  more  peripheral 
blasts  plus  promyelocytes,  20%  or  more  peripheral  basophils,  cyto-
genetic  clonal  evolution  (presence  of  chromosomal  abnormalities  in 
addition  to  Ph),  and  thrombocytopenia  <100  ×  109/L  (unrelated  to 
therapy).  About  5–10%  of  patients  present  with  de  novo  accelerated 
phase  or  blastic  phase.  The  prognosis  of  de  novo  accelerated  phase 
with TKI therapy has improved significantly, with an estimated 8-year 
survival rate of 75%. The median survival of accelerated phase evolv-
ing  from  chronic  phase  has  also  improved  from  a  historical  median 
survival of 18 months to an estimated 4-year survival rate of 70% on 
TKI therapy. Therefore, the criteria for accelerated-phase CML should 
be  revisited  because  most  clinical  criteria  defining  accelerated  phase 
have lost much of their prognostic significance. Blastic-phase CML is 
defined by the presence of 30% or more peripheral or marrow blasts or 
the presence of sheets of blasts in extramedullary disease (usually skin, 
soft  tissues,  or  lytic  bone  lesions).  Blastic-phase  CML  is  commonly 
myeloid (60%) but can present uncommonly as erythroid, promyelo-
cytic,  monocytic,  or  megakaryocytic.  Lymphoid  blastic  phase  occurs 
in about 25% of patients. Lymphoblasts are terminal deoxynucleotide 
transferase  positive  and  peroxidase  negative  (although  occasionally 

with low positivity up to 3–5%) and express lymphoid markers (CD10, 
CD19, CD20, CD22). However, they also often express myeloid mark-
ers (50–80%), resulting in diagnostic challenges. Proper immunophe-
notypic  diagnosis  is  important  because  lymphoid  blastic-phase  CML 
is quite responsive to anti-ALL-type chemotherapy (e.g., hyper-CVAD 
[cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone]) in 
combination with TKIs (complete response rate 70%; median survival 
3 years; high rates of bridging to allogeneic SCT and possible cure).

 ■ PROGNOSIS AND CML COURSE
Before the imatinib era, the annual mortality in CML was 10% in the 
first 2 years and 15–20% thereafter. The median survival in CML was 
3–7  years  (with  hydroxyurea-busulfan  and  interferon  α).  Without 
a  curative  option  of  allogeneic  SCT,  the  course  of  CML  was  toward 
transformation  to,  and  death  from,  accelerated  or  blastic  phases  for 
most patients as the rate of complete cytogenetic response with inter-
feron was low. Even apparent disease stability was unpredictable, with 
some patients demonstrating sudden transformation to a blastic phase. 
With imatinib therapy, the annual mortality in CML has decreased to 
1–2% in the first 20 years of observation. More than half of the deaths 
are from conditions other than CML, such as old age, comorbidities, 
accidents, suicides, other cancers, and other medical conditions (e.g., 
infections, surgical procedures). The estimated 10-year survival rate is 
86%, or 92% if only CML-related deaths are considered (Fig. 105-2). 
The  course  of  CML  has  also  become  quite  predictable.  In  the  first  2 
years  of  TKI  therapy,  rare  sudden  transformations  are  still  reported 
(1–2%),  usually  lymphoid  blastic  transformations  that  respond  to 
combinations  of  chemotherapy  and  TKIs  followed  by  allogeneic 
SCT. These may be explained by the intrinsic mechanisms of sudden 
transformation  already  existing  in  the  CML  clones  before  the  start  
of therapy that were not amenable to TKI inhibition, in particular ima-
tinib.  Second-generation  TKIs  (nilotinib,  dasatinib,  bosutinib)  used  as 
frontline  therapy  have  reduced  the  incidence  of  transformation  in  the 
first 2–3 years from 6–8% with imatinib to 2–5% with second-generation 
TKIs.  Disease  transformation  to  accelerated  or  blastic  phase  is  rare 
with continued TKI therapy, estimated at <1% annually in years 4–10 
of  follow-up  on  the  original  imatinib  trials.  Patients  usually  develop 
resistance in the form of cytogenetic resistance or relapse, followed by 
hematologic  relapse  and  subsequent  transformation,  rather  than  the 
previously feared sudden transformations without the warning signals 
of cytogenetic-hematologic relapse.

Before  the  imatinib  era,  several  pretreatment  prognostic  factors 
predicted for worse outcome in CML and have been incorporated into 
prognostic models and staging systems. These have included older age, 
significant  splenomegaly,  anemia,  thrombocytopenia  or  thrombocy-
tosis,  high  percentages  of  blasts  and  basophils  (and/or  eosinophils), 
marrow fibrosis, interstitial deletions in the long arm of chromosome 9, 
clonal evolution, and others. Different risk models and staging systems, 
derived  from  multivariate  analyses,  were  proposed  to  define  different 
risk groups. As with the introduction of cisplatin into testicular cancer 
therapy,  the  introduction  of  TKIs  into  CML  therapy  has  decreased  or, 
in  some  instances,  eliminated  the  prognostic  impact  of  most  of  these 
prognostic factors and the significance of the CML models (e.g., Sokal, 
Hasford,  European  Treatment  and  Outcome  Study  [EUTOS]).  Treat-
ment-related  prognostic  factors  have  emerged  as  the  most  important 
prognostic factors in the era of imatinib therapy. Achievement of com-
plete cytogenetic response has become the major therapeutic endpoint 
and  is  the  only  endpoint  associated  with  improvement  in  survival. 
Achievement  of  MMR  or  MR3  is  associated  with  decreased  risk  of 
events (relapse) and CML transformation but has not been associated 
with survival prolongation among patients with complete cytogenetic 
response.  This  may  be  due  to  the  survival  benefit  conferred  by  the 
achievement  of  complete  cytogenetic  response,  which  approximates 
normal  life  expectancy,  and  to  the  efficacy  of  salvage  TKI  therapies, 
which  are  and  should  be  implemented  at  the  first  evidence  of  cyto-
genetic  relapse.  Achievement  of  undetectable  BCR-ABL1  transcripts 
(complete  molecular  response  [CMR])  or  deep  molecular  response 
(DMR; defined as MR4 or MR4.5), particularly when sustained (>2–5 
years), may offer the possibility of treatment-free remission and may

FIGURE 105-2  A. Survival in newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by era of therapy (MD Anderson Cancer Center experience from 1965 to 
present).  Top  blue  curve  is  survival  with  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKIs),  accounting  for  only  CML-related  deaths.  The  orange  curve  (second  from  top)  accounts  for 
deaths related to CML or CML treatment complications (e.g., deaths following allogeneic stem cell transplant [SCT]). The red curve (third from top) is survival including all 
deaths regardless of causality (old age, car accidents, suicide, gun shots, second cancers, complications of unrelated surgeries, infections, others). The difference in the 
denominators, 613 minus 597 cases, is because 16 deaths were from unknown/undocumented causes (outside MD Anderson and no good tracking for cause of death).

The lack of achievement of MMR or DMR should not be considered as 
“failure” of a particular TKI therapy and/or an indication to change the 
TKI or to consider allogeneic SCT.

Long-term  updates  of  randomized  trials  suggest  that  second- 
generation TKIs and imatinib are similarly effective in lower-risk CML; 
second-generation  TKIs  may  offer  a  therapeutic  advantage  among 
patients with high-risk CML.

TREATMENT

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia

Since 2001, six drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CML. These include five 
oral TKIs: imatinib (Gleevec, Glivec), nilotinib (Tasigna), dasatinib 
(Sprycel),  bosutinib  (Bosulif),  and  ponatinib  (Iclusig).  Dasatinib, 
nilotinib, and bosutinib are referred to as second-generation TKIs; 
ponatinib  is  referred  to  as  a  third-generation  TKI.  Nilotinib  is 

similar in structure to imatinib but 30 times more potent. Dasatinib 
and bosutinib inhibit the SRC family of kinases in addition to ABL1, 
with dasatinib reported to be 300 times more potent and bosutinib 
30–50 times more potent than imatinib. In contrast to all other TKIs, 
bosutinib  has  no  activity  against  c-Kit  or  platelet-derived  growth 
factor receptor (PDGFR). Ponatinib is highly effective against wild-
type and mutant BCR/ABL1 clones. It is also the only available BCR-
ABL1 TKI active against T315I, a gatekeeper mutation resistant to 
the  other  four  ATP-competitive  TKIs  (Table  105-2).  Ponatinib 
also inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), 
which  may  be  at  least  partly  responsible  for  the  high  incidence 
of  hypertension  observed  with  this  agent  (Table  105-2).  Imatinib   
400 mg orally daily, nilotinib 300 mg orally twice a day (on an empty 
stomach),  dasatinib  100  mg  orally  daily,  and  bosutinib  400  mg 
orally daily are approved for frontline therapy of CML. Dasatinib  
50 mg orally daily is as effective in frontline therapy as 100 mg daily, 
and  significantly  less  toxic.  All  four  are  also  approved  for  salvage 
therapy (nilotinib 400 mg twice daily; bosutinib 500 mg daily; oth-
ers at the same dose as frontline therapy), in addition to ponatinib

(45 mg daily). Ponatinib 45 mg daily may be associated with serious 
side  effects:  arterio-occlusive  events,  pancreatitis,  hypertension, 
and skin rashes. A response-directed dose adjusted regimen, with a 
starting dose of 45 mg and reduction to 15 mg once a cytogenetic 
response  is  achieved,  has  resulted  in  a  reduced  incidence  of  arte-
rio-occlusive events and has become standard. Imatinib, dasatinib 
(140  mg  daily),  bosutinib,  and  ponatinib  are  also  approved  for 
the  treatment  of  CML  in  transformation  (accelerated  and  blastic 
phase),  whereas  nilotinib  is  only  approved  for  chronic  and  accel-
erated phase. The sixth approved drug is omacetaxine (Synribo), a 
protein synthesis inhibitor with presumed more selective inhibition 
of  the  synthesis  of  the  BCR-ABL1  oncoprotein.  It  is  approved  for 
the treatment of chronic- and accelerated-phase CML after failure 
of two or more TKIs, at 1.25 mg/m2 subcutaneously twice a day for 
14 days for induction and for 7 days for consolidation-maintenance. 
The main adverse event of omacetaxine is prolonged myelosuppres-
sion;  thus,  many  experts  use  shorter  schedules  (e.g.,  omacetaxine 
5–7  days  induction  and  2–5  days  maintenance),  often  combined 
with a TKI (Table 105-2).

Imatinib,  dasatinib,  bosutinib,  and  nilotinib  are  all  acceptable 
frontline  therapies  in  CML.  The  long-term  results  of  imatinib 
are  very  favorable.  The  10-year  follow-up  results  show  a  cumula-
tive  complete  cytogenetic  response  rate  (occurring  at  least  once) 
of  83%,  with  60–65%  of  patients  being  in  complete  cytogenetic 
response at 5-year follow-up. The estimated 10-year survival rate is 
~85%. Among patients continuing on imatinib, the annual rate of 
transformation to accelerated-blastic phase in years 4–8 is <1%. In 
three  randomized  studies,  one  comparing  nilotinib  300  mg  twice 
daily  or  400  mg  twice  daily  with  imatinib  (ENESTnd),  another 
comparing dasatinib 100 mg daily with imatinib (DASISION), and 
a third comparing bosutinib 400 mg daily with imatinib (BFORE), 
the second-generation TKIs were associated with better outcomes 
in  early  surrogate  endpoints,  including  higher  rates  of  complete 
cytogenetic  responses  (85–87%  vs  77–82%),  MMRs  (5-year  rates 
76–77% vs 60–64%), and MR4.5 (5-year rates 42–53% vs 31–33%), 
with lower rates of transformation to accelerated and blastic phase 
(2–5% vs 7%). However, no study has shown a survival benefit with 
second-generation TKIs. This may be because the rate of complete 
cytogenetic response is ultimately similarly high with imatinib ver-
sus  second-generation  TKIs,  and  also  because  sequential  therapy 
with  TKIs  (following  close  observation  and  treatment  change  at 
progression)  provides  highly  effective  therapy  for  most  patients; 
this ensures adequate long-term outcome despite relapse or intoler-
ance after initial therapy.

Salvage therapy in chronic phase with dasatinib, nilotinib, bosu-
tinib, or ponatinib is associated with complete cytogenetic response 
rates  of  30–60%,  depending  on  the  salvage  status  (cytogenetic  vs 

hematologic relapse), prior response to other TKIs, number of prior 
TKIs used, and the mutations at the time of relapse. Complete cyto-
genetic responses are generally durable, particularly in the absence 
of clonal evolution. Ponatinib is the only TKI active in the setting 
of  T315I  mutation,  with  complete  cytogenetic  response  rates  of 
50–70% among patients who have received two or more TKIs. The 
estimated 5-year survival rates with new TKIs as salvage are 70–75% 
(compared with <50% before their availability). For example, with 
dasatinib salvage after imatinib failure in chronic-phase CML, the 
estimated  7-year  rate  of  major  molecular  was  46%,  the  estimated 
7-year survival rate was 65%, and progression-free survival rate was 
42%.  Thus,  TKIs  in  the  salvage  setting  have  already  reduced  the 
annual mortality from the historical rate of 10–15% to ≤5%.

The goal of CML therapy is survival prolongation. The achieve-
ment of treatment-free remission (TFR) status has become a ther-
apeutic  goal  of  increased  interest  (sustained  DMR  or  CMR  after 
discontinuation  of  TKI  therapy).  In  current  practice,  with  the 
availability of appropriate TKI therapy and with compliance, mon-
itoring,  and  changing  of  TKI  therapy  as  indicated  by  response/
resistance  and  side  effects,  patients  can  have  a  near-normal  life 
expectancy, with a “relative” survival similar to that of the general 
population. Therefore, in standard practice, achievement and main-
tenance of a complete cytogenetic response are the aims of therapy, 
because complete cytogenetic response is the only outcome associ-
ated with survival prolongation. Lack of achievement of an MMR 
(protects against events; associated with longer event-free survival) 
or of DMR (offers the potential of treatment discontinuation and of 
TFR) should not be considered indications to change TKI therapy 
or to consider allogeneic SCT. A general practice rule is to continue 
the particular TKI chosen at the most tolerable dose schedule not 
associated with grade 3–4 side effects or with bothersome chronic 
side effects, for as long as possible, until either cytogenetic relapse 
or  the  persistence  of  unacceptable  side  effects.  These  two  factors 
(i.e.,  cytogenetic  relapse  and  intolerable  side  effects)  are  the  indi-
cators of “failure” of a particular TKI therapy. A second emerging 
general  practice  rule  is  that  patients  with  CML  should  always 
receive daily TKI therapy throughout their lifetime (chronic, trans-
formation),  either  alone  (chronic)  or  in  combinations  (possibly 
for  those  in  transformation,  although  combinations  not  formally 
approved), except perhaps in situations of “molecular cure” (TFR; 
elective discontinuation of TKI if DMR sustained for >2 to 5 years, 
followed by close monitoring) or after allogeneic SCT with unde-
tectable disease.

Because of the increasing prevalence of CML (cost of TKI ther-
apy)  and  the  emerging  evidence  of  possible  organ  toxicities  with 
long-term  use  (e.g.,  renal  with  imatinib  and  bosutinib;  arterio- 
occlusive with nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib), a goal of therapy 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   824

21/01/22   3:51 PM

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyof increasing interest in CML is to achieve eradication of the dis-
ease (molecular “cure” or TFR) that is prolonged and durable, with 
recovery of nonneoplastic, nonclonal hematopoiesis off TKI ther-
apy. The first step toward this aim is to obtain the highest rates of 
DMR lasting for at least 2 or more years. This is currently achievable 
in about 25–30% of patients treated with imatinib and in 40–45% 
of  patients  treated  with  second-generation  TKIs.  Approximately 
50–60% of those who meet these criteria and discontinue therapy 
remain  free  from  therapy  and  in  DMR-MMR.  As  a  result,  TFR 
rates are estimated to be about 15–20% after imatinib therapy and 
25–30% after second-generation TKIs.

Recommendations  provided  by  the  National  Comprehensive 
Cancer  Network  (NCCN)  and  by  the  European  LeukemiaNet 
(ELN)  propose  optimal/expected,  suboptimal/warning,  and  fail-
ure response scenarios at different time points of TKI treatment 
duration.  Unfortunately,  they  may  have  been  misinterpreted  in 
current  practice  because  oncologists  often  report  that  their  aim 
of treatment is the achievement of MMR and disease eradication. 
Significantly,  a  substantial  proportion  of  oncologists  consider 
a  change  of  TKI  therapy  in  a  patient  in  complete  cytogenetic 
response if they note loss of MMR (increase of BCR-ABL1 tran-
scripts  [IS]  from  ≤0.1%  to  >0.1%).  This  perception  may  be  the 
result  of  confusion  regarding  the  aims  of  the  NCCN  and  ELN 
guidelines,  which  have  been  updated  often  as  a  result  of  matur-
ing  data  and  have  multiple  treatment  endpoint  considerations. 
Although  such  endpoints  may  have  been  suggested  as  possible 
criteria  for  failure  or  suboptimal  response,  it  is  important  to 
emphasize that no randomized study has yet shown that a change 
of TKI treatment in patients with complete cytogenetic response 
because  of  a  loss  of  MMR,  versus  changing  at  the  time  of  cyto-
genetic  relapse,  improves  survival  or  other  long-term  outcomes. 
This is likely because of the high efficacy of salvage TKI therapy 
at the time of cytogenetic relapse.

Side  effects  of  TKIs  are  generally  mild  to  moderate,  although 
with long-term TKI therapy, they could affect the patient’s quality of 
life. Serious side effects occur in <5–10% of patients. With imatinib 
therapy, common mild to moderate side effects include fluid reten-
tion, weight gain, nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, periorbital edema, 
bone  or  muscle  aches,  fatigue,  and  others  (rates  of  10–20%).  In 
general, second-generation TKIs are associated with lower rates of 
these bothersome adverse events. However, dasatinib 100 mg daily 
is associated with higher rates of myelosuppression (20–30%), par-
ticularly  thrombocytopenia,  with  pleural  (10–25%)  or  pericardial 
effusions (≤5%), and with pulmonary hypertension (<5%). A lower 
dose  of  dasatinib  (50  mg  daily  instead  of  100  mg  daily)  used  in 
frontline CML therapy has resulted in similar efficacy and a lower 
incidence of serious side effects (pleural effusions <5%, myelosup-
pression <10%). Nilotinib is associated with higher rates of hyper-
glycemia  (10–20%),  pruritus  and  skin  rashes,  hyperbilirubinemia 
(typically  among  patients  with  Gilbert’s  syndrome  and  mostly  of 
no  clinical  consequences),  and  headaches.  Nilotinib  is  also  asso-
ciated  with  occasional  instances  of  pancreatitis  (<5%).  Nilotinib   
300–400  mg  twice  daily  is  associated  with  a  10-year  cumulative 
incidence of cardiovascular complications of 15–25%. Bosutinib is 
associated with higher rates of liver toxicity, renal dysfunction, and 
early  and  self-limited  gastrointestinal  adverse  events,  particularly 
diarrhea  (70–85%).  Occasionally,  the  gastrointestinal  symptoms 
mimic chronic severe enterocolitis, which reverses with treatment 
discontinuation.  Ponatinib  45  mg  daily  is  associated  with  higher 
rates of serious skin rashes (10–15%), pancreatitis (10%), elevations 
of amylase/lipase (10%), and systemic hypertension (50–60%; severe 
in 20%). Arterio-occlusive events (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, 
and  peripheral  arterial)  have  been  reported  with  most  TKIs.  The 
incidence appears to be highest with ponatinib, but both nilotinib 
and dasatinib are associated with these events at an incidence sig-
nificantly higher than imatinib. Among the TKIs, bosutinib is asso-
ciated with the lowest incidence of cardiovascular events. Nilotinib 
and dasatinib may cause prolongation of the QTc interval; therefore, 
they should be evaluated cautiously in patients with prolonged QTc

interval on electrocardiogram (>470–480 ms), and drugs given for 
other medical conditions should have relatively smaller or no effects 
on  QTc.  These  side  effects  can  often  be  dose-dependent  and  are 
generally  reversible  with  treatment  interruptions  and  dose  reduc-
tions. Dose reductions can be individualized. However, the lowest 
estimated effective doses of TKIs (from different studies and treat-
ment  practices)  are  imatinib  100–200  mg  daily;  nilotinib  150  mg   
twice  daily  or  200  mg  daily;  dasatinib  20  mg  daily;  bosutinib   
200–300 mg daily; and ponatinib 15 mg daily.

With  long-term  follow-up,  rare  but  clinically  relevant  serious 
toxicities  are  emerging.  Renal  dysfunction  and  occasionally  renal 
failure (creatinine elevations >2–3 mg/dL) are observed in 2–3% of 
patients,  more  frequently  with  imatinib  and  bosutinib  than  other 
TKIs,  and  usually  reverse  with  TKI  discontinuation  and/or  dose 
reduction.  Rarely,  patients  may  develop  TKI-related  peripheral 
neuropathy  or  even  central  neurotoxicities  that  are  misdiagnosed 
as  dementia  or  Alzheimer’s  disease;  they  may  reverse  slowly  after 
TKI  discontinuation.  Pulmonary  hypertension  has  been  reported 
with dasatinib (<1–2%) and should be considered in a patient with 
shortness of breath and a normal chest x-ray (echocardiogram with 
emphasis on measurement of pulmonary artery pressure). This may 
be  reversible  with  dasatinib  discontinuation  and  occasionally  the 
use of sildenafil citrate. Systemic hypertension has been observed 
more  often  with  ponatinib.  Hyperglycemia  and  occasionally  dia-
betes  have  been  noted  more  frequently  with  nilotinib.  Finally, 
mid- and small-vessel arterio-occlusive and vasospastic events have 
been reported at low but significant rates with nilotinib and pona-
tinib and should be considered possibly TKI-related and represent 
indications to interrupt or reduce the dose of the TKI. These events 
include  angina,  coronary  artery  disease,  myocardial  infarction, 
peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease,  transient  ischemic  attacks, 
cerebral  vascular  accidents,  Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  and  acceler-
ated atherosclerosis. Although these events are uncommon (<5%) 
(10-year  cumulative  rates  of  15%  with  nilotinib  300  mg  BID  and 
20–25% with 400 mg BID, compared with <5% with imatinib), they 
are  clinically  significant  for  the  patient’s  long-term  prognosis  and 
occur at significantly higher rates than in the general population, 
particularly among patients with other risk factors for such events. 
Serious arterio-occlusive and vasospastic events are more common 
with ponatinib 45 mg daily (5-year rates 20%). 

Discontinuation of TKIs and Treatment-Free Remissions  Several 
studies  have  confirmed  that  TKI  discontinuation  among  patients 
who achieve DMR (MR4.5) for longer than 2–3 years can result in 
TFR rates of 40–60%. Discontinuation of TKI therapy after 5+ years 
of  CMR  is  associated  with  TFR  rates  of  70–80%  or  greater.  Since 
the incidence of durable MR4.5 (BCR-ABL transcripts [IS] ≤0.0032%) 
is  30–60%,  ~15–30%  of  all  patients  with  CML  on  TKI  therapy 
may achieve TFR. This approach is ready for community practice 
provided  it  is  done  under  optimal  conditions.  These  include  the 
following: patients must have low or intermediate Sokal risk CML 
in  first  chronic  phase  (no  evidence  or  history  of  transformation), 
with history of quantifiable BCR-ABL1 transcripts (e13a2, e14a2), 
on  long-term  TKI  therapy  (5–8+  years),  with  documented  DMR 
for >2–3 years (assessed every 6 months during this time span and 
with a PCR with adequate sensitivity), and should be monitored at 
referral centers that offer rigorous testing of residual CML disease. 
Patients must also be compliant to frequent monitoring (PCR stud-
ies every 1–2 months for the first 6 months, then every 2 months 
until 2 years and every 3–6 months thereafter). 

ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT
Allogeneic  SCT,  a  curative  modality  in  CML,  is  associated  with 
long-term survival rates of 40–60% when implemented in chronic 
phase. It is associated with early (1-year) mortality rates of 5–30%. 
Although  the  5-  to  10-year  survival  rates  were  reported  to  be 
~50–60% (and considered as cure rates), ~10–15% of patients die 
in the subsequent 1–2 decades from subtle long-term complications 
of the transplant (rather than from CML relapse). These are related

to  chronic  graft-versus-host  disease  (GVHD),  organ  dysfunction, 
development of second cancers, occasional late relapses, and haz-
ard  ratios  for  mortality  higher  than  in  the  normal  population. 
Other significant morbidities include infertility, chronic immune- 
mediated complications, cataracts, hip necrosis, and other morbid-
ities affecting quality of life. The cure and early mortality rates in 
chronic-phase CML are also associated with several factors: patient 
age,  duration  of  chronic  phase,  whether  the  donor  is  related  or 
unrelated,  degree  of  matching,  preparative  regimen,  and  others. 
In  accelerated-phase  CML,  the  cure  rates  with  allogeneic  SCT 
are  30–50%,  depending  on  the  definition  of  accelerated  disease. 
Patients with clonal evolution as the only criterion have cure rates 
of  up  to  40–50%.  Patients  undergoing  allogeneic  SCT  in  second 
chronic  phase  have  cure  rates  of  40–50%.  The  cure  rates  with 
allogeneic  SCT  in  blastic-phase  CML  are  ≤20%.  Post–allogeneic 
SCT  strategies  are  now  implemented  in  the  setting  of  molecular 
or  cytogenetic  relapse  or  in  hematologic  relapse/transformation. 
These  include  the  use  of  TKIs  for  prevention  or  treatment  of 
relapse, donor lymphocyte infusions, and second allogeneic SCTs, 
among  others.  TKIs  appear  to  be  highly  successful  at  reinducing 
cytogenetic/molecular  remissions  in  the  setting  of  cytogenetic  or 
molecular relapse after allogeneic SCT. 

Choice and Timing of Allogeneic SCT  Allogeneic SCT was con-
sidered first-line CML therapy before 2000. The maturing positive 
experience  with  TKIs  has  now  relegated  its  use  to  after  first-line 
TKI  failures.  An  important  question  is  the  optimal  timing  and 
sequence  of  TKIs  and  allogeneic  SCT  (whether  allogeneic  SCT 
should be used as second- or third-line therapy). Among patients 
who present with or evolve to blastic phase, combinations of che-
motherapy and TKIs should be used to induce remission, followed 
by allogeneic SCT as soon as possible. The same applies to patients 
who  evolve  from  chronic  to  accelerated  phase.  Patients  with  de 
novo  accelerated-phase  CML  may  do  well  with  long-term  TKI 
therapy (estimated 8-year survival rate 75%); the timing of alloge-
neic SCT depends on their optimal response to TKI (achievement 
of complete cytogenetic response). Among patients who relapse in 
chronic phase, the treatment sequence depends on several factors: 
(1)  patient  age  and  availability  of  appropriate  donors;  (2)  risk  of 
allogeneic  SCT;  (3)  presence  or  absence  of  clonal  evolution  and 
mutations;  (4)  patient’s  prior  history  and  comorbidities;  and  (5) 
patient  and  physician  preferences  (Table  105-3).  Patients  with 
T315I mutations at relapse should be offered ponatinib and consid-
ered for allogeneic SCT particularly if in blastic phase and perhaps 
also  in  accelerated  phase  (because  of  the  short  follow-up  with 
ponatinib).  Patients  with  mutations  involving  Y253H,  E255K/V, 
and  F359V/C/I  respond  better  to  dasatinib  or  bosutinib.  Patients 
with mutations involving V299L, T315A, and F317L/F/I/C respond 
better  to  nilotinib.  Comorbidities  such  as  diabetes,  hypertension, 
pulmonary hypertension, chronic lung disease, cardiac conditions, 
and pancreatitis may influence the choice for or against a particular 
TKI. Patients with clonal evolution, unfavorable mutations, or lack 
of  major/complete  cytogenetic  response  within  1  year  of  salvage 
TKI  therapy  have  short  remission  durations  and  should  consider 
allogeneic  SCT  as  more  urgent  in  the  setting  of  salvage.  Patients 
without clonal evolution or mutations at relapse and who achieve a 
complete cytogenetic response with TKI salvage have long-lasting 
complete  remissions  and  may  delay  the  option  of  allogeneic  SCT 
to  third-line  therapy.  Finally,  older  patients  (age  65–70  years  or 
older)  and  those  with  high  risk  of  mortality  with  allogeneic  SCT 
may forgo this curative option for several years of disease control in 
chronic phase with or without cytogenetic response (Table 105-3).  
In  emerging  nations,  where  generic  imatinib  is  now  available  at 
the annual price of $400–3000, frontline imatinib is a cost-effective  
therapy.  However,  second-line  therapy  with  allogeneic  SCT,  a 
one-time  curative  option  with  a  cost  of  $20,000–100,000,  may  be 
considered (in preference to second-generation TKIs—annual cost 
above  $40,000–100,000)  as  a  more  cost-effective  national  health

care strategy in CML. Table 105-3 summarizes a general guidance 
to the choice of TKIs versus allogeneic SCT. 

MONITORING THERAPY IN CML
Achievement  of  complete  cytogenetic  response  by  12  months  of 
imatinib therapy and its persistence later, the only consistent prog-
nostic  factor  associated  with  prolonged  survival,  is  now  the  main 
therapeutic endpoint in CML. Failure to achieve a complete cyto-
genetic  response  by  12  months  or  occurrence  of  later  cytogenetic 
or  hematologic  relapse  is  considered  as  treatment  failure  and  an 
indication  to  change  therapy.  Because  salvage  therapy  with  other 
TKIs  may  re-establish  good  outcome,  it  is  important  to  ensure 
patient compliance to continued TKI therapy and change therapy 
when cytogenetic relapse is confirmed unless this is related to non-
adherence. Patients on frontline imatinib therapy should be closely 
monitored until documentation of complete cytogenetic response, 
at which time they can be monitored every 6 months with periph-
eral blood PCR, or more frequently (e.g., every 3 months), if there 
are concerns about changes in BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Cytogenetic 
relapse on imatinib is an indication of treatment failure and need 
to change TKI therapy. Mutational analysis in this instance helps in 
the selection of the next TKI and identifies mutations in 30–50% of 
patients. Mutational studies by standard Sanger sequencing (which 
is the technique currently available in most clinical laboratories) in 
patients in complete cytogenetic response (in whom there may be 
concerns  of  increasing  BCR-ABL1  transcripts)  identify  mutations 
in ≤5% and are therefore not indicated. Earlier response has been 
identified as a prognostic factor for long-term outcome, including 
achievement of partial cytogenetic response (BCR-ABL1 transcripts 
≤10%) by 3–6 months of therapy. Failure to achieve such a response 
has been associated with significantly worse survival.

The  use  of  second-generation  TKIs  (dasatinib,  bosutinib,  nilo-
tinib)  as  frontline  therapy  changed  the  monitoring  approach 
slightly. Patients are expected to achieve major cytogenetic response 
(or BCR-ABL1 transcripts ≤10%) by 3–6 months of therapy. Failure 
to do so is associated with worse event-free survival, transformation

among  such  patients  is  still  high,  ~80–90%,  which  is  better  than 
what would be anticipated if such patients were offered allogeneic 
SCT  at  that  time.  Changes  of  therapy  for  patients  with  “slow” 
response have not been proven to be of long-term benefit compared 
to  changes  when  more  obvious  signs  of  resistance  appear.  Thus, 
slow response to therapy is considered a warning signal, but it is not 
known whether changing therapy to other TKIs at that time would 
improve longer-term outcome. 

TREATMENT OF ACCELERATED AND BLASTIC PHASES
Patients  in  accelerated  or  blastic  phase  may  receive  therapy  with 
TKIs, preferably second- or third-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilo-
tinib, bosutinib, ponatinib), alone or in combination with chemo-
therapy, to reduce the CML burden, before undergoing allogeneic 
SCT.  Response  rates  (major  hematologic)  with  single-agent  TKIs 
range from 30 to 50% in accelerated phase and from 20 to 30% in 
blastic phase. Cytogenetic responses, particularly complete cytoge-
netic responses, are uncommon (10–30%) and transient in blastic 
phase.  Studies  of  TKIs  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  show 
that combined TKI-chemotherapy strategies increase the response 
rates and their durability and improve survival. This is particularly 
true  in  CML  lymphoid  blastic  phase,  where  the  combination  of 
anti-ALL  chemotherapy  with  TKIs  results  in  complete  response 
rates of 70% and median survival times of 3 years (compared with 
historical response rates of 40–50% and median survival times of 
12–18  months).  This  allows  many  patients  to  undergo  allogeneic 
SCT in a state of minimal CML burden or second chronic phase, 
which are associated with higher probability of long-term survival. 
In CML nonlymphoid blastic phase, anti–acute myeloid leukemia 
chemotherapy combined with TKIs results in CR rates of 30–50% 
and  median  survival  times  of  9–12  months  (compared  with  his-
torical response rates of 20–30% and median survival times of 3–5 
months). In accelerated phase, response to single TKIs is significant 
in conditions where “softer” accelerated phase criteria are consid-
ered (e.g., clonal evolution alone, thrombocytosis alone, significant 
splenomegaly or resistance to hydroxyurea, but without evidence of 
high blast and basophil percentages). In accelerated phase, combi-
nations  frequently  include  TKIs  with  low-intensity  chemotherapy 
such as low-dose cytarabine, decitabine, interferon α, hydroxyurea, 
or others. 

OTHER TREATMENTS AND SPECIAL THERAPEUTIC 
CONSIDERATIONS 
Interferon  ` 
Interferon  α  is  considered  in  combination  with 
TKIs  (an  investigational  approach),  sometimes  after  CML  failure 
on  TKIs,  occasionally  in  patients  during  pregnancy,  or  as  part  of 
investigational strategies with TKIs to eradicate residual molecular 
disease. 

Chemotherapeutic Agents  Hydroxyurea remains a safe and effec-
tive agent (at daily doses of 0.5–10 g) to reduce initial CML burden, 
as a temporary measure in between definitive therapies, or in com-
bination with TKIs to sustain complete hematologic or cytogenetic 
responses.  Busulfan  is  often  used  in  allogeneic  SCT  preparative 
regimens.  Because  of  its  side  effects  (delayed  myelosuppression, 
Addison-like disease, pulmonary and cardiac fibrosis, myelofibro-
sis), it is now rarely used in the chronic management of CML. Low-
dose  cytarabine,  decitabine,  anthracyclines,  6-mercaptopurine, 
6-thioguanine, thiotepa, anagrelide, and other agents are sometimes 
useful in different CML settings to control the disease burden. 

Others  Splenectomy is now seldom considered to alleviate symp-
toms  of  massive  splenomegaly  and/or  hypersplenism.  Splenic 
irradiation  is  rarely  used,  if  at  all,  because  of  the  postirradiation 
adhesions  and  complications.  Leukapheresis  is  occasionally  used 
in  patients  presenting  with  extreme  leukocytosis  and  leukostatic 
complications. Single doses of high-dose cytarabine or high doses

of hydroxyurea, with tumor lysis management, may be as effective 
and less cumbersome. 
Special Considerations  Women with CML who become pregnant 
should  discontinue  TKI  therapy  immediately.  Among  125  babies 
delivered  to  women  with  CML  who  discontinued  imatinib  ther-
apy as soon as the pregnancy was known, three babies were born 
with neurologic, skeletal, and renal malformations, suggesting the 
teratogenicity  of  imatinib  known  from  animal  studies.  A  similar 
experience has been reported with dasatinib, where the incidence 
of malformations was reported to be higher, 10–12%. There are no 
or  little  data  with  other  TKIs.  Control  of  CML  during  pregnancy 
can  be  managed  with  leukapheresis  for  severe  symptomatic  leu-
kocytosis in the first trimester and with hydroxyurea subsequently 
until  delivery.  There  are  reports  of  successful  pregnancies  and 
deliveries of normal babies with interferon α therapy and registry 
studies  in  essential  thrombocytosis  of  its  safety,  but  interferon  α 
has side effects that may be troublesome during pregnancy, can be 
antiangiogenic, and may increase the risk of spontaneous abortions.
Approximately 10–15% of patients on TKI therapy may develop 
chromosomal  abnormalities  in  the  Ph-negative  cells.  These  may 
involve  loss  of  chromosome  Y,  trisomy  8,  20q–,  chromosome  5 
or  7  abnormalities,  and  others.  Most  chromosomal  abnormalities 
disappear spontaneously and may be indicative of the genetic insta-
bility  of  the  hematopoietic  stem  cells  that  predisposes  the  patient 
to  develop  CML  in  the  first  place.  Rarely  (in  <1%  of  instances), 
abnormalities  involving  chromosomes  5  or  7  may  be  truly  clonal 
and evolve into myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leuke-
mia. This is thought to be part of the natural course of patients in 
whom CML was suppressed and who live long enough to develop 
other hematologic malignancies.

 ■ GLOBAL ASPECTS OF CML
Routine physical examinations and blood tests in the United States and 
advanced countries result in early detection of CML in most patients. 
About  50–70%  of  patients  with  CML  are  diagnosed  incidentally, 
and high-risk CML as defined by prognostic models (e.g., Sokal risk 
groups) is found in only 10% of patients. This is not the same situa-
tion in emerging nations where most patients are diagnosed following 
evaluation for symptoms and many present with high tumor burden, 
such  as  massive  splenomegaly,  and  advanced  phases  of  CML  (high-
risk CML documented in 20–30%). Therefore, the prognosis of such 
patients on TKI therapy may be worse than the published experience.
The high cost of TKI therapies (annual costs of $90,000–140,000 in 
the  United  States;  lower  but  variable  in  the  rest  of  the  world)  makes 
the  general  affordability  of  such  treatments  difficult.  Although  TKI 
treatment penetration is high in nations where cost of therapy is not an 
issue (e.g., Sweden, European Union), it may be less so in other nations, 
even  in  advanced  ones  like  the  United  States,  where  out-of-pocket 
expenses may be prohibitive to a subset of patients. Although the esti-
mated  10-year  survival  in  CML  is  >85%  in  single-institution  studies 
(e.g.,  MD  Anderson  Cancer  Center),  in  national  studies  in  countries 
with TKI affordability (Sweden) (Figs. 105-2 and 105-3) or in clinical 
trials  (where  all  patients  have  access  to  TKIs  throughout  their  care), 
the  estimated  10-year  survival  worldwide,  even  16  years  after  the 
introduction of TKI therapies, is likely to be <50%. The Surveillance, 
Epidemiology,  and  End  Results  (SEER)  data  from  the  United  States 
report an estimated 5-year survival rate of 60% in the era of TKIs. It 
appears that the treatment penetration of imatinib and other TKIs into 
CML therapy worldwide is still not optimal.

The current high cost of TKI therapies poses two additional consid-
erations. The first are the treatment pathways and guidelines in nations 
where TKIs may not be affordable by patients or the health care system. 
In these conditions, there are trends of pathways advocating allogeneic 
SCT as frontline or second-line therapy (i.e., after imatinib failure; as a 
onetime cost of $20,000–100,000) despite the associated mortality and 
morbidities. The second is the choice of frontline TKI therapy. Imatinib 
is now available in generic forms at affordable costs ($400–10,000 per

and effective generic TKIs may become preferred frontline and salvage 
therapies in CML, precluding the necessity of an allogeneic SCT in first 
salvage in poorer nations.

106 Acute Lymphoid  
Leukemia
Dieter Hoelzer

In  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL),  the  malignant  clone  arises 
from  hematopoietic  progenitors  in  the  bone  marrow  or  lymphatic 
system resulting in an increase of immature nonfunctioning leukemic 
cells. Infiltration of bone marrow leads to anemia, granulocytopenia, 
and  thrombocytopenia  with  the  clinical  manifestations  of  fatigue, 
weakness, infection, and hemorrhage. These symptoms are more often 
the reason a patient first seeks medical advice rather than consequences 
of tumor bulk, such as lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly 
caused  by  leukemic  infiltration,  or  symptoms  of  the  central  nervous 
system (meningeosis leukemica).
 ■ INCIDENCE AND AGE
ALL is the most frequent neoplastic disease in children with an early 
peak at the age of 3–4 years. The incidence in adults ranges from 0.7 to 
1.8/100 000 per year, being somewhat higher in adolescents and young 
adults (AYAs), decreasing in adults, but increasing again in elderly peo-
ple.  Thus,  Philadelphia  chromosome–positive  ALL  (Ph+  ALL;  BCR/
ABL translocation) is observed in half of elderly B-lineage patients. The 
frequency of immunologic, cytogenetic, and genetic subtypes changes 
substantially with age.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
The  etiology  of  acute  leukemias  is  unknown.  Internal  and  external 
factors influence the incidence of leukemia. Exposure to ionizing radi-
ation or to chemicals, including prior chemotherapy, is associated with 
an increased risk of developing leukemia, more often observed in acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML). However, increasingly, secondary ALLs have 
been  observed,  particularly  after  cytostatic  treatment  with  alkylating 
agents and topoisomerase inhibitors as treatment for primary tumors, 
most often for AML, myelodysplastic syndromes, or breast cancer.
 ■ CONGENITAL DISORDERS
Patients  with  some  rare  congenital  chromosomal  abnormalities  have 
a higher risk of development of acute leukemia (e.g., Klinefelter’s syn-
drome, Fanconi’s anemia, Bloom’s syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and 
neurofibromatosis).  Those  with  Down’s  syndrome  have  a  twentyfold 
increased  incidence  of  leukemia;  ALL  is  increased  in  childhood  and 
AML at an older age.
 ■ INFECTIOUS AGENTS
No  direct  evidence  implicates  viruses  as  a  major  cause  of  human 
acute  leukemia.  However,  viruses  are  involved  in  the  pathogenesis 
of two lymphoid neoplasias. In the endemic African type of Burkitt’s 
lymphoma, the Epstein-Barr virus, a DNA virus of the herpes family, 
has  been  implicated  as  a  potential  causative  agent  (see  Chap.  194). 
Endemic  infection  with  human  T-cell  leukemia  virus  I  in  Japan  and 
the Caribbean has been shown to be an etiologic agent for rare cases of 
adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (see Chap. 201).
 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION
The  diagnosis  of  acute  leukemia  is  first  made  by  examination  of  the 
peripheral  blood  and  bone  marrow.  For  further  classification  of  the 
leukemic  blast  cells,  cytochemical  stains,  immunologic  markers,  and 
cytogenetic  and  molecular  analysis  are  required.  The  immunologic 
markers are still the major criteria to subdivide into B-cell lineage or 
T-cell lineage ALL leukemias.
 ■ PERIPHERAL BLOOD
Peripheral  blood  counts  and  a  differential  count  from  a  Wright-
Giemsa–stained blood smear are essential at the time of presentation. 
The white blood cell (WBC) count in ~40% of ALL patients is reduced 
or  normal  (Table  106-1).  Only  16%  of  patients  have  a  WBC  above

100 × 105/L. It is noteworthy that in 8% of ALL patients, no circulating 
leukemic blast cells were observed. Thus, in the frequently used auto-
matic blood cell counting, the diagnosis may not be detected.

Peripheral  blood  characteristically  shows  anemia,  thrombocytope-
nia, and neutropenia. Nearly one-third of patients have hemoglobin lev-
els <7–8 g/dL. A platelet count below the critical number of 20 × 109/L 
and neutropenia (neutrophils <0.5 × 109/L), which is associated with a 
higher risk of infection, are each noted in one-fifth of adults with ALL.
 ■ BONE MARROW EXAMINATION
Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies are important to assess immunologic, 
cytogenetic,  and  genomic  markers.  Direct  smears  from  the  bone 
marrow are essential to confirm the diagnosis of acute leukemia and 
to  distinguish  between  AML  and  ALL.  The  bone  marrow  is  usually 
heavily packed with leukemic blast cells with >90% in ~70% of patients, 
and  thus,  the  normal  hemopoietic  elements  are  greatly  reduced  or 
absent. A biopsy of the bone marrow will further demonstrate marked 
hypercellularity with replacement of fat spaces, normal elements, and 
occasionally increased fibrosis.
 ■ LUMBAR PUNCTURE
The  examination  of  the  cerebrospinal  fluid  is  an  essential  routine 
diagnostic measure for ALL. Central nervous system (CNS) leukemia 
is  diagnosed  if  ≥5  cells/μL  or  leukemic  blast  cells  were  observed  by 
morphology in cerebrospinal fluid. Opinions differ as to when the first 
lumbar  puncture  should  be  done—i.e.,  either  delay  lumbar  puncture 
until remission is achieved to avoid seeding of the CNS with leukemic 
blast cells from the peripheral blood during the spinal tap, or perform 
the  lumbar  puncture  before  treatment  starts,  since  early  recognition 
of CNS disease will lead to immediate CNS-specific therapy. Lumbar 
puncture is restricted to patients with an adequate platelet count (>20 ×  
109/L) and without manifest clinical hemorrhages. To eliminate poten-
tially transferred blast cells, patients should receive intrathecal metho-
trexate at the first lumbar puncture.
 ■ MORPHOLOGIC SUBTYPES IN ALL
The French-American-British (FAB) classification distinguished three 
subgroups. L1 and L2 morphology has no clinical consequences. Only 
the L3 morphology, observed in up to 5% of adult patients, is indicative 
for mature B-cell lineage ALL (B-ALL) (see Chap. 62).

 ■ IMMUNOLOGIC SUBTYPES
A  series  of  monoclonal  antibodies  is  employed  to  identify  antigens 
expressed  on  the  surface  of  leukemic  cells,  corresponding  to  the 
pathways of normal B-cell differentiation (see Fig. 108-2). The aim of 
the immunologic classification is to subdivide ALLs according to the 
presence or absence of B-cell or T-cell markers. A marker is considered 
positive if >20% of the cells are stained with the monoclonal antibody.
There are different immunologic classifications, such as that of the 
European  Group  for  the  Immunological  Characterization  of  Leuke-
mias  (EGIL),  with  clear  therapeutic  implications.  Table  106-2  gives 
a  simplified  correlation  of  immunologic  subtypes,  cytogenetics  and 
molecular aberrations, and clinical characteristics.

B-Cell Lineage ALL (B-ALL)  More than 70% of adult ALLs are 
of B-cell origin, and the most frequent immunologic subtype, common 
ALL, is characterized by the presence of the ALL antigen CD10 with-
out markers of relatively mature B cells such as cytoplasmic or surface 
membrane  immunoglobulins.  Pre-B-ALL  (early  B-ALL)  is  charac-
terized  by  the  expression  of  cytoplasmic  immunoglobulin,  which  is 
negative in common ALL, but otherwise is identical with respect to all 
other cell markers. Pro-B-ALL corresponds to early B-cell differentia-
tion and was formerly termed non-T-, non-B-ALL or null ALL because 
neither T-cell nor B-cell features could be demonstrated. This subtype 
is HLA-DR, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and CD19 positive 
and composes ~12% of adult ALLs. Mature B-ALL is seen in 3–4% of 
adults and is also known as Burkitt’s leukemia. In mature B-ALL, blast 
cells express surface antigens of mature B cells, including the sIgM.

T-Cell Lineage ALL (T-ALL)  Approximately 25% of adult ALLs 
are of T-cell lineage. All cases express the T-cell antigen CD7 and cyto-
plasmatic CD3 (CyCD3) or surface CD3. According to their phase of 
T-cell differentiation, they may express other T-cell antigens (e.g., the 
E-rosette receptor CD2 and/or the cortical thymocyte antigen CD1a). 
Early pro/pre-T-ALL (also termed early T precursor ALL [ETP-ALL]), 
cortical or thymic T-ALL, and mature T-ALL can be distinguished with 
these  markers.  ETP-ALL  is  characterized  by  lack  of  CD1a  and  CD8, 
weak CD5 expression, and at least one myeloid/stem cell marker.

Biphenotypic  or  Mixed  Leukemias  Biphenotypic  leukemias  are 
defined as those expressing markers of both lymphoid and myeloid lin-
eages on the same leukemic cells. Bilineage leukemias are those with two 
populations of blast cells with either lymphoid or myeloid antigens. It is not 
clear whether these patients should receive an ALL or AML treatment pro-
tocol. In pediatric studies, starting with a pediatric ALL protocol seemed 
preferable, which was then followed by AML consolidation elements.

 ■ CYTOGENETIC AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS
Cytogenetic and molecular analyses should be performed in all cases in 
ALL. They are important to define ALL subtypes, can identify indepen-
dent prognostic markers of disease-free survival, and may determine 
specific targeted therapies.

The diagnostic techniques for ALL are standard cytogenetics, fluo-
rescence  in  situ  hybridization,  and  reverse  transcriptase  polymerase 
chain reaction. These methods allow the detection of Ph+ ALL, with 
the  chromosomal  translocation  t(9;22)(q34;q11)  and  the  detection 
of  the  corresponding  BCR-ABL1  gene  rearrangement.  Further  ALL 
entities  that  have  been  identified  are  t(4;11)(q21;q23)/MLL-AFA4, 
abn11q23/MLL, and t(1;19)(q23;p13)/PBX-E2A.

Gene  expression  profiling,  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  array 
analysis, array-comparative genomic hybridization, and next-generation 
sequencing  recognize  the  newly  defined  ALL  entities:  ETP-ALL  and 
Ph-like ALL.

Ph-like ALL, also known as BCR-ABL1-like ALL, is characterized 
by genetic lesions similar to Ph+ ALL, associated with IKZF1 (Ikaros) 
gene deletion, CLRF2 (gene for cytokine-like receptor-2) overexpres-
sion,  and  tyrosine  kinase  activating  rearrangements  involving  ABL1, 
JAK2,  PDGFRB,  and  several  other  genes;  however,  it  is  BCR-ABL1 
negative.  The  frequency  is  10%  in  children  and  25–30%  in  young 
adults but does not increase further with age like Ph+ ALL. Treatment 
based  on  the  underlying  genetic  lesion  with  BCR-ABL  inhibitors

(e.g.,  dasatinib)  or  JAK2  inhibitors  (e.g.,  ruxolitinib)  has  so  far  had 
limited success in adults.

 ■ MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE
Minimal residual disease (MRD) is the detection of residual leukemic 
cells that are not recognizable by light microscopy. Methods for deter-
mining MRD are based on the detection of leukemia-specific aberrant 
immunophenotypes  by  flow  cytometry,  the  evaluation  of  leukemia- 
specific  rearranged  immunoglobulin  or  T-cell  receptor  sequences  by 
real-time  quantitative  polymerase  chain  reaction,  or  the  detection  of 
fusion  genes  associated  with  chromosomal  abnormalities  (e.g.,  BCR-
ABL, MLL-AF4). The detection limit with these methods is 10–3–10–5 
(0.1–0.001%). With new techniques such as next-generation sequenc-
ing (NGS) or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), the 
sensitivity  may  increase  to  10–5–10–6.  The  phenotypic  aberrations  are 
unique to each patient with ALL and can be detected in up to 95% of 
individuals. Collection of bone marrow at diagnosis for identification 
of patients’ individual markers is essential for follow-up of MRD.

 ■ MOLECULAR RESPONSE AFTER INDUCTION 
THERAPY AND IMPACT ON OUTCOME
Achievement  of  molecular  complete  response/molecular  remission 
is  the  most  relevant  independent  prognostic  factor  for  disease-free 
survival and overall survival in pediatric and adult ALL (Table 106-3). 
Patients with molecular complete remission after induction therapy had 
significantly  superior  outcomes  in  several  studies,  with  a  disease-free 
survival  rate  of  ~70%  compared  to  <40%  for  MRD-positive  patients. 
Patients  with  molecular  failure  after  induction  should  proceed  to  a 
targeted therapy to reduce the tumor load, followed by allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation (SCT), if possible.

 ■ PROGNOSTIC FACTORS, RISK STRATIFICATION, 
AND MRD
The aim of identification of prognostic parameters at diagnosis, which 
include  age,  white  blood  cell  count,  immunophenotype,  and  cytoge-
netic  and  genetic  aberrations,  is  to  stratify  patients  into  risk  groups: 
standard-risk  patients  are  patients  without  any  risk  factor,  and  high-
risk patients are those with one or more risk factors. High-risk patients 
are  most  often  candidates  for  SCT  in  first  complete  remission  (CR). 
MRD  is  thus  the  most  important  prognostic  factor  during  therapy 
(Fig.  106-1);  20–30%  of  adult  ALL  patients  who  are  MRD  negative 
after induction will relapse. Potential reasons include loss of sensitivity, 
evolution of leukemic subclones, and extramedullary origin of disease. 
If the MRD status of a patient is not available, risk stratification should 
rely on clinical and laboratory risk factors evaluated at diagnosis.

 ■ TREATMENT PRINCIPLES
Treatment  of  ALL  consists  usually  of  pre-phase  therapy,  induction 
therapy,  consolidation  cycles,  and  maintenance  treatment.  Treatment 
should start immediately when the diagnosis of ALL is established.

Pre-Phase  Therapy  Pre-phase  therapy  consisting  of  glucocorti-
coids (prednisone 20–60 mg/d or dexamethasone 6–16 mg/d, both IV 
or  PO)  alone  or  in  combination  with  another  drug  (e.g.,  vincristine, 
cyclophosphamide) is usually given for ~5–7 days. It allows safe tumor 
reduction to avoid tumor lysis syndrome, to initiate supportive therapy, 
such  as  substitution  of  platelets/erythrocytes,  or  to  treat  infections. 
The time required for pre-phase therapy will also allow time to obtain 
results of the diagnostic workup (e.g., cytogenetics, molecular genetics).

Induction Therapy  The goal of induction therapy is the achieve-
ment of a CR or, even better, a molecular CR. With current regimens, 
the  CR  rate  has  increased  to  80–90%  and  is  higher  for  standard-risk 
patients (>90%) and lower for high-risk patients (~60%).

Induction  regimens  are  centered  around  vincristine,  glucocorti-
coids, and anthracyclines with or without cyclophosphamide or cyta-
rabine. L-Asparaginase is the only ALL-specific drug and is now more 
intensively used in adults. Pegylated asparaginase has the advantage of 
a significantly longer period of asparagine depletion. Dexamethasone 
is often preferred to prednisone because it penetrates the blood-brain 
barrier and also acts on resting leukemic blast cells.

Two  chemotherapy  regimens  are  widespread  (Fig.  106-1).  One  is 
patterned  after  the  pediatric  BFM  (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster)  pro-
tocol,  which  is  mostly  used  in  European  adult  ALL  trials.  Another 

approach is to repeat two different alternating intensive chemotherapy 
cycles, identical for induction and consolidation, for eight cycles, such 
as  Hyper-CVAD  (hyperfractionated  cyclophosphamide,  vincristine, 
doxorubicin,  and  dexamethasone)  protocol,  which  is  preferentially 
used in the United States but also in many other parts of the world.

Postremission  Consolidation  Usual  protocols  use  six  to  eight 
courses and often contain systemic high-dose (HD) therapy to reach 
sufficient  drug  levels  in  sanctuary  sites  such  as  the  CNS.  Most  often 
HD methotrexate (1–1.5 g/m2 and up to 3–5 g/m2) and/or HD cytara-
bine (4–12 doses at 1–3 g/m2) are administered.

Maintenance Therapy  Maintenance therapy, a strategy transferred 
from  childhood  ALL,  is  mandatory.  It  consists  of  6-mercaptopurine 
and methotrexate plus intrathecal therapy. The potential effect of fur-
ther  intensification  cycles  during  maintenance  remains  unclear.  The 
duration of maintenance therapy for T-ALL and B-ALL is 2–2.5 years, 
except  for  Burkitt’s  leukemia,  for  which  it  is  not  required.  In  Ph+ 
ALL, patients also require maintenance therapy that should include a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), most likely the TKI that has been used 
during induction and consolidation therapy. It is also standard to give 
a TKI after allogeneic SCT. The duration of maintenance therapy with a 
TKI is also 2–2.5 years and should be guided by MRD evaluation. TKI 
use is often interrupted or switched to another TKI if toxicity occurs.
 ■ TREATMENT OF ALL PATIENTS ACCORDING TO 
AGE
The  outcome  of  ALL  is  strictly  related  to  the  age  of  a  patient,  with 
cure rates of ~90% in children, decreasing to <10% in elderly or frail

patients.  Thus,  age-adapted  protocols  have  emerged,  where  the  age 
limits are directed by the hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities. 
Table 106-4 provides a summary of the best results obtained in adult 
ALL according to ALL subtype, age, and treatment. Molecular CRs are 
often durable. The major risk of relapse is in the first 2 years; thereafter, 
relapse is much less likely.
 ■ PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT OF CENTRAL 
NERVOUS SYSTEM LEUKEMIA
Prophylactic CNS therapy in ALL is essential in order to prevent CNS 
leukemia and to avoid spread of leukemic cells from the CNS back to 
the periphery. Treatment options include intrathecal therapy, systemic 
HD  chemotherapy,  and  cranial  radiation  therapy  (CRT).  Intrathecal 
therapy  mostly  consists  of  methotrexate  as  a  single  drug  or  in  com-
bination  with  cytosine  arabinoside  (AC)  with  or  without  glucocorti-
coids. The route of intrathecal therapy application is generally lumbar 
puncture.  Systemic  HD  chemotherapy  may  comprise  HDAC  or  HD 
methotrexate since both drugs reach cytotoxic drug levels in the CSF 
and show effectiveness in overt CNS leukemia. CRT (18–24 Gy in 12 
fractions over 16 days) is also effective as preventive treatment of CNS 
leukemia. Using combined modalities for CNS prophylaxis, the CNS 
relapse rate has decreased to 2–5%.

Particular  attention  to  CNS  prophylaxis  is  required  for  targeted 
therapies.  In  Ph+  ALL,  not  all  TKIs  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier 
equally.  Dasatinib  and  probably  ponatinib  do  cross  the  blood-brain 
barrier, whereas imatinib and nilotinib do not. In addition to immu-
notherapy, intrathecal therapy is required because most antibodies do 
not enter the CNS.

CNS involvement at diagnosis is observed in 5–10% of adult patients 
and is higher in mature B-ALL (up to 10–15%) and T-ALL (up to 10%). 
Treatment  consists  of  the  standard  chemotherapy  with  additional 
intrathecal applications 3–5 times per week until blast cells are cleared 
in the spinal fluid. Patients with initial CNS involvement have a similar 
overall survival as CNS-negative patients.

Relapse  in  CNS  is  usually  accompanied  by  bone  marrow  involve-
ment, and if blast cells are not seen morphologically, MRD as a sign of 
discrete infiltration is positive in nearly all cases. CNS relapse requires 
local  as  well  as  systemic  therapy.  The  outcome  after  CNS  relapse  is 

dismal,  and  salvage  chemotherapy  followed  by  allogeneic  SCT  is  the 
most effective option. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (most 
often  targeting  CD19)  can  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier  and  achieve 
CRs in patients with CNS relapse.
 ■ STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION
SCT  is  an  essential  part  of  the  treatment  strategy  for  adult  ALL. 
Peripheral blood cells are increasingly being used as a stem cell source, 
instead  of  bone  marrow.  In  addition,  a  shift  from  sibling  stem  cell 
donors  to  matched  unrelated  donors  or  haploidentical  transplants 
from relatives has occurred. Indications for SCT in first CR are contro-
versial. However, in most studies, SCT is recommended for high-risk 
patients defined either by conventional prognostic factors or by MRD 
positivity.  High-risk  patients  transplanted  in  first  CR  have  a  survival 
rate  of  50%  or  greater;  decreasing  transplant-related  mortality  from 
20–30%  to  10–15%  has  contributed  substantially  to  better  outcomes. 
For standard-risk patients with sustained molecular remission, alloge-
neic SCT in first CR is not recommended. Autologous SCT should be 
restricted to MRD-negative patients, BCR-ABL–negative patients, Ph+ 
patients, and older patients because it is less toxic but associated with a 
substantially higher relapse rate. For all relapsed adult ALL patients, an 
allogeneic SCT is thus far the only curative option.
 ■ PEDIATRIC-INSPIRED THERAPIES FOR 
ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS
The  principle  of  pediatric-inspired  therapies  is  to  have  higher  doses 
and  more  applications  of  ALL-specific  drugs  such  as  glucocorticoids, 
vincristine, and L-asparaginase and fewer myeloablative anthracyclines 
or alkylating agents, with strict adherence to time-dose intensity, thereby 
reducing the role of SCT. The overall survival rates for AYAs are 70–80%.

 ■ ADULT ALL
The  treatment  results  for  adult  ALL  patients  have  greatly  improved 
with  more  intensive  chemotherapy,  optimized  SCT,  and  better  sup-
portive care. In several recent multicenter prospective trials, the overall 
survival rate for standard-risk patients was >70% with chemotherapy 
alone, and for high-risk patients, the overall survival rate has increased 
from 20–30% to >50%.

 ■ ELDERLY ALL
Palliative  treatment  regimens  for  elderly  patients  have  failed,  with 
CR rates of ~40%, a high early death rate of 24%, and a poor overall 
survival of only a few months. Intensive chemotherapy has also failed, 
with  a  higher  CR  rate  of  56%,  but  still  an  early  death  rate  of  23%, 
and  only  moderate  improvement  of  overall  survival  to  14  months. 
Specific  elderly  ALL  protocols  with  less  intensive  therapy  based  on 
glucocorticoids, vincristine, and asparaginase, largely avoiding anthra-
cyclines  and  alkylating  agents,  have  improved  outcomes.  The  early 
treatment-related death rate decreased to <10%, CR rates improved to 
~90%, and overall survival of ~30 months was noted.

Frail patients above the age of 70–75 years have very poor survival 
of <10%. Hopefully, this will improve with ongoing targeted therapies 
with either TKIs in Ph+ ALL or immunotherapies.

 ■ TARGETED THERAPIES
Substantial progress in adult ALL has been made in the past decade by 
the introduction of new targeted therapies, including TKIs and immu-
notherapeutic approaches (Table 106-5).
 ■ TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS IN 
PHILADELPHIA-POSITIVE ALL
Patients with Ph+ ALL constitute ~25% of adult B-ALL patients, with 
the frequency increasing to ~50% among elderly patients. In the pre- 
imatinib era, CR rates were 60–70%; survival with chemotherapy was 
~10%, and after allogeneic SCT, it was ~30%. With the first-generation 
TKI imatinib, CR rates increased to 80–90%, the rate of BCR-ABL neg-
ativity increased from 5 to 50%, and the 5- to 10-year overall survival 
improved to 50–70%.

Faster  and  deeper  molecular  responses  are  achieved  with  second- 
generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib), and these responses apparently

translate  into  a  survival  benefit.  The  third-generation  TKI  ponatinib 
is also effective in tumors bearing mutations (particularly T315I) that 
convey resistance to earlier-generation TKIs.

Treating adult Ph+ ALL with an allogeneic SCT in first CR is still a 
good treatment option for adult patients, with a 5-year overall survival 
of 60–70%. In elderly patients, when low-intensity chemotherapy was 
combined with dasatinib, the CR rate was >90%. In a next step, by com-
bining  mini-chemotherapy  with  a  TKI  and  adding  immunotherapy 
with inotuzumab (an anti-CD22 antibody), the CR rate was >90% and 
the overall survival improved further. A pilot experience with a chemo-
therapy-free regimen composed of dexamethasone, the TKI dasatinib, 
and the bispecific antibody blinatumomab (anti-CD19 and anti-CD3) 
demonstrated  a  CR  rate  of  98%  and  2-year  overall  and  disease-free 
survival rates of 95% and 88%, respectively. Blinatumomab eliminates 
Ph+ leukemic cells with resistant mutations.

 ■ IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC APPROACHES
Treatments  involving  monoclonal  antibodies  or  activated  T  cells  are 
currently changing the treatment paradigm of ALL. The prerequisite is 
that B-lineage blast cells express a variety of specific antigens, such as 
CD19, CD20, and CD22 (Table 106-6) that are targetable with a wide 
variety of monoclonal antibodies. A new treatment principle is the acti-
vation of the patient’s T cells to destroy their CD19+ leukemic blasts.

Anti-CD20  The  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  rituximab  has 
improved  the  outcome  of  patients  with  de  novo  Burkitt’s  leukemia/

lymphoma. With repeated short cycles of intensive chemotherapy com-
bined with rituximab, the overall survival increased to >80%. Rituxi-
mab is now included in most B-ALL regimens and is given at the usual 
dose of 375 mg/m2 on day –1 before chemotherapy for at least eight or 
more cycles. This leads to a significant increase in MRD negativity and 
improved survival.

Anti-CD22  Monoclonal  antibodies  directed  against  CD22  are 
linked to cytotoxic agents, such as calicheamicin (inotuzumab ozogami-
cin),  or  to  plant  or  bacterial  toxins  (epratuzumab).  In  a  randomized 
trial of relapsed or refractory ALL patients, the CR rate was 66% and 
significantly superior to the CR rate with standard chemotherapy. Ino-
tuzumab is now included in first-line therapy for Ph+ and Ph– patients.

Anti-CD19  Targeting CD19 is of great interest because this antigen 
is  highly  expressed  in  all  B-lineage  cells,  most  likely  including  early 
lymphoid precursor cells. A new promising approach is the bispecific 
antibody  blinatumomab,  which  combines  single-chain  antibodies  to 
CD19 and CD3, such that T cells lyse the CD19-bearing B cells.

Blinatumomab  is  particularly  effective  in  MRD-positive  patients, 
with a 70–80% conversion to MRD negativity, translating into improved 
overall survival; ~25% of MRD-negative patients survived without any 
further treatment. Blinatumomab has also moved to frontline therapy.

CAR-T  Cells  The  adoptive  transfer  of  CAR-modified  T  cells 
directed  against  CD19  is  a  promising  approach  for  the  treatment  of 
CD19+  childhood  or  adult  ALL.  In  the  first  three  larger  studies  in 
adults  with  relapsed  or  refractory  ALL,  the  CR  rate  ranged  from  67 
to 91% with MRD negativity in 60–81% of the patients who achieved 
CR. Overall survival is 50% or more at ≥2 years, which is remarkable 
for these heavily pretreated patients. CAR-T cells are also effective in 
CNS leukemia and in other extramedullary sites. CAR-T cell therapy 
in relapsed or refractory ALL was first considered as a bridge to allo-
geneic  SCT,  applied  in  10–50%  of  patients,  but  the  necessity  for  an 
allogeneic SCT after CAR-T cells is unclear. CAR-T cell therapies are 
also moving to the frontline. CD19-negative relapses after CAR-T cell 
therapy or blinatumomab due to downregulation of CD19 expression 
are a relevant obstacle.

Toxicities  of  Immunotherapies  The  anti-CD22  agent  ino-
tuzumab  ozogamicin  is  associated  with  hepatotoxicity,  including 
veno-occlusive  disease,  particularly  after  allogeneic  SCT,  but  can  be 
managed  by  reduced  dosing  and  limitation  of  cycles.  For  anti-CD19 
therapies, cytokine release syndrome and severe neurotoxicity are the 
most  prominent  toxicities  and  often  require  intensive  care  unit  care 
(more so after CAR-T cells than blinatumomab). Management of these 
complications  has  improved  with  early  recognition.  Because  toxic 
death  after  immunotherapies  is  very  low  compared  to  intensive  che-
motherapy or allogeneic SCT, immunotherapies are now increasingly 
included in frontline therapy.

 ■ TREATMENT OF T-ALL
Immunotherapy for T-ALL is still not available and intensive chemo-
therapy  is  still  the  mainstay  in  combination  with  the  T  cell–specific 
drug nelarabine. Currently, γ-secretase targeting NOTCH1, checkpoint 
inhibitors  such  as  bortezomib  and  venetoclax,  and  HDAC  inhibitors 
are being explored.

 ■ CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Cytogenetic  and  molecular  analysis  at  diagnosis  allows  identification 
of  ALL  subentities,  requiring  different  treatment  options.  Evaluation 
of  MRD  is  the  most  important  parameter  for  treatment  decisions. 
The  greatest  progress  has  been  achieved  by  targeted  therapies,  such 
as  TKIs  for  Ph+  ALL  and  new  immunotherapeutic  approaches.  This 
will lead to further improved outcome of adult ALL patients, 50% of 
whom are already surviving 5–10 years and are most likely cured. New 
options and advances, such as low-intensity chemotherapy, reduction 
of SCT, incorporation of targeted therapies, and reduction of toxicities, 
will improve the quality of life of patients and lead to individualized 
approaches for each patient.

107 Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia
Jennifer A. Woyach, John C. Byrd

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a monoclonal proliferation of 
mature  B  lymphocytes  defined  by  an  absolute  number  of  malignant 
cells in the blood (5 × 109/mL). The presence of malignant B cells under 
this count in the blood without nodal, spleen, or liver involvement and 
absent cytopenias is a precursor of this disease called monoclonal B cell 
lymphocytosis  (MBL)  with  ~1–2%  chance  per  year  of  progressing  to 
overt CLL. CLL is a heterogeneous disease in terms of natural history, 
with  some  patients  presenting  asymptomatically  and  never  requiring 
therapy, whereas others present with symptomatic disease, require mul-
tiple lines of therapy, and eventually die of their disease. Over the past 
10–15 years, the understanding of CLL origin and biology has grown 
exponentially, leading first to more refined disease definition, prognos-
tic markers, and, subsequently, introduction of novel therapies that have 
significantly changed the natural history of this disease. In this chapter, 
we review the epidemiology, biology, and management of CLL, with a 
focus on new knowledge that is currently changing standards of care.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
CLL is primarily a disease of older adults, with a median age at diag-
nosis  of  71  and  an  age-adjusted  incidence  of  4.5/100,000  people  in 
the United States. The prevalence of CLL has increased over the past 
decades due to improvements in therapy for this disease and also sur-
vival of older patients from other medical ailments. In 1980, the 5-year 
overall  survival  of  patients  was  69%,  and  this  increased  to  87.9%  in 
2007 and is likely even higher today. The male-to-female ratio is 2:1; 
however,  as  patients  age,  the  ratio  becomes  more  even,  and  over  the 
age of 80, the incidence is equal between men and women. The disease 
is most common in Caucasians, less common in Hispanic and African 
Americans, and rare in the Asian population.

Unlike many other malignancies, there have been no definitive links 
between CLL and exposures. Indeed, CLL is one of the only types of 
leukemia  not  linked  to  radiation  exposure.  Agent  Orange  exposure 
has  been  implicated,  and  CLL  is  thus  a  service-connected  condition 
for those who were exposed to Agent Orange in the Vietnam conflict.

CLL  is  one  of  the  most  familial-associated  malignancies,  and  the 
first-degree  relative  of  a  CLL  patient  has  an  8.5-fold  elevated  risk  of 
developing CLL than the general population. MBL is also more com-
mon in families with two first-degree relatives having CLL, further sup-
porting  a  genetic  predisposition  of  this  disease.  Despite  this,  specific 
genes conferring risk in the familial setting outside of specific families 
have  been  difficult  to  identify.  In  genome-wide  association  studies 
(GWAS), ~30 single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, 
which  is  estimated  to  account  for  19%  of  the  familial  risk  of  CLL. 
Genes involved in apoptosis, telomere function, B-cell receptor (BCR) 
activation, and B-cell differentiation have all been implicated in GWAS. 
Variants  in  shelterin  complex  proteins  involved  in  telomere  mainte-
nance such as POT1 have been identified in a small number of families.

BIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
 ■ CELL OF ORIGIN
The  cell  of  origin  in  CLL  has  not  definitively  been  established.  The 
morphology, immunophenotype, and gene expression pattern of CLL 
cells are that of a mature B cell (Fig. 107-1), and so it has been pre-
sumed that the initiating cell is a mature lymphocyte, perhaps memory 
B cells. However, many facets of CLL biology do not support this idea, 
including antigen-binding characteristics of CLL cells and the presence 
of  stereotyped  BCRs.  Other  possibilities  include  a  stepwise  process 
including  a  series  of  transforming  events  at  various  stages  of  B-cell 
development, potentially including de-differentiation of more mature 
cells.  The  self-renewing,  multipotent  hematopoietic  stem  cell  (HSC) 
might also be the originating cell of CLL, postulated based on trans-
plant studies in mice showing clonal leukemic cell development with 
different characteristics from donor leukemia after transplantation of 
HSCs. More work will be required to elucidate the origins of CLL.
 ■ B-CELL RECEPTOR SIGNALING IN CLL
Perhaps the most important advancement in CLL biology is the under-
standing of the role of BCR signaling in the disease. CLL has distinct 
BCR signaling as compared to normal B cells, which is characterized 
by low-level IgM expression, variable response to antigen stimulation, 
and tonic activation of antiapoptotic signaling pathways that promote 
tumor  survival.  CLL  cells  by  gene  expression  profiling  share  many 
features  with  antigen-activated  mature  B  cells,  suggesting  a  role  for 
activation of BCR signaling in the disease pathogenesis. Tissue-based 
microarrays have revealed upregulation of BCR pathway genes in the 
lymph  nodes  and  bone  marrow  compared  to  the  peripheral  blood, 
suggesting  a  particular  importance  of  this  pathway  in  microenviron-
mental homing.

Fitting  with  the  role  of  BCR  signaling  in  CLL,  one  of  the  most 
influential  prognostic  factors  identified  in  this  disease  is  the  muta-
tional  status  of  the  immunoglobulin  heavy  chain  variable  (IGHV) 
region.  During  normal  B-cell  maturation,  the  variable  regions  of  the

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyimmunoglobulin  heavy  chain  undergo  somatic  hypermutation.  In 
CLL, ~60% of patients have IGHV that is ≥2% mutated from germline. 
This may indicate a more mature, postgerminal center progenitor, and 
is typically associated with a more indolent disease course. Conversely, 
~40% of patients will have IGHV <2% mutated from germline, which 
is associated with more rapid progression of disease and short survival 
prior to the era of therapeutics that target BCR. Unfavorable biologic 
properties  including  enhanced  telomerase  activity,  overexpression  of 
activation-induced  cytidine  deaminase,  increased  nuclear  factor-κB 
(NF-κB) activity, high-risk genomic mutations (e.g., NOTCH1, SF3B1, 
TP53,  ATM),  and  clonal  evolution  are  also  associated  with  IGHV 
unmutated disease.

Because  IGHV  sequencing  was  initially  cumbersome  to  perform, 
a  number  of  surrogate  factors  have  been  identified;  however,  none 
yet  have  been  shown  to  be  equal  or  superior  to  IGHV  sequencing. 
The most prevalent of these surrogate markers are Zap-70 expression, 
ZAP-70  methylation,  and  surface  CD38  expression.  Zap-70  protein 
is  a  normal  intracellular  T-cell  signaling  protein  that  is  aberrantly 
expressed in most IGHV unmutated CLL cells. CD38 is a marker that 
is also more highly expressed on the surface of IGHV unmutated CLL 
cells. Both of these prognostic factors are widely used but limited in 
their applicability. Zap-70 protein status is difficult to measure by flow 
cytometry and has low reproducibility. Measurement of methylation 
status of the ZAP-70 promoter is much more precise but not widely 
available.  CD38  expression  is  easier  to  measure  by  flow  cytometry 
but not as highly predictive of outcomes and can change during the 
course of disease.

 ■ CYTOGENETIC ABNORMALITIES
Besides IGHV mutational status, recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities 
are the most robust prognostic factor clinically available in CLL. These 
abnormalities  are  typically  identified 
by  fluorescent  in  situ  hybridization 
(FISH)  analysis;  however,  stimulated 
metaphase karyotype has a role as well. 
The most well-characterized abnormal-
ities  include  del(13)(q14.3),  trisomy 
12,  del(11)(q22.3),  and  del(17)(p13.1)  
(Fig.  107-2).  The  presence  of  sole 
del(13)(q14.3)  is  associated  with  more 
indolent  disease,  prolonged  survival, 
and good response to traditional ther-
apies.  Usually,  this  abnormality  is  not 
seen  on  banded  karyotype  analysis, 
and when present on karyotype, it indi-
cates  a  larger  deletion  involving  the 
retinoblastoma gene, which negates the 
favorable prognosis associated with this 
marker.  Trisomy  12  has  a  more  inter-
mediate  prognosis.  The  del(11)(q23.3) 
results in deletion of the ATM gene and 
is associated with bulky lymphadenop-
athy  and  aggressive  disease  in  young 
patients,  with  inferior  prognosis,  and 
more rapid progression to symptomatic 
disease.  The  del(17)(p13.1)  results  in 
loss of one allele of the tumor suppres-
sor  TP53  and  is  associated  with  the 
poorest  prognosis  in  CLL  with  rapid 
disease  progression,  poor  response  to 
traditional  therapies,  and  shorter  sur-
vival.  Other  abnormalities  have  been 
shown to be important in smaller stud-
ies  but  are  not  routinely  performed  at 
all  centers.  Finally,  complex  karyotype 
(three or more abnormalities) on stim-
ulated  metaphase  karyotype  analysis 
has significant adverse impact on time 
to treatment and overall survival, with

data indicating that increasing complexity is even more deleterious to 
response and survival.

Clonal evolution, or acquisition of cytogenetic or molecular abnor-
malities, is common in CLL, especially in patients with IGHV unmu-
tated  CLL.  Because  the  tumor  cytogenetics  can  change  over  time,  it 
is  recommended  that  FISH,  with  or  without  cytogenetics,  is  checked 
before every line of therapy, mostly to evaluate acquisition of del(17)
(p13.1).

 ■ GENE MUTATIONS AND MIR ALTERATIONS
Compared with many other malignancies, the genome in CLL is rel-
atively simple, with an average CLL genome carrying ~20 nonsynon-
ymous alterations and ~5 structural abnormalities. And, unlike many 
other  hematologic  malignancies,  there  is  no  unifying  genetic  lesion, 
and  most  recurrent  genetic  driving  mutations  exist  at  frequencies  of 
<5%. Whole genome and whole exome sequencing have identified the 
most common mutations in CLL to be in SF3B1, NOTCH1, MYD88, 
ATM,  and  TP53  (Table  107-1).  Most  of  the  identified  mutations  in 
these genes are common among different malignancies, and with the 
exception of MYD88, they are generally identified with much higher 
frequency in IGHV unmutated disease.

NOTCH1  mutations  are  present  in  ~15%  of  CLL  patients  and  are 
commonly  associated  with  trisomy  12.  Although  multiple  different 
mutations are seen, most are located within the PEST (proline, glutamic 
acid, serine, and threonine) domain and result in constitutive NOTCH 
signaling.  NOTCH1  mutations  have  been  associated  with  lower  sensi-
tivity  to  CD20  antibody  therapy  and  increased  risk  of  transformation 
to  aggressive  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL;  Richter’s  trans-
formation), although its relevance in the era of targeted therapies is less 
clear.  SF3B1  is  a  component  of  the  RNA  spliceosome  and  is  mutated 
in  10–15%  of  CLL  cases.  Mutations  appear  to  be  associated  with

intermediate-risk disease, and, functionally, SF3B1 may be important in 
the response to DNA damage.

Mutations  of  the  tumor  suppressor  TP53  are  found  in  ~5%  of  CLL 
patients with previously untreated early-stage disease and up to 40% with 
later stages. Seventy percent of the time, these mutations coexist with 
del(17)(p13.1),  effectively  eliminating  TP53  function.  As  expected, 
and consistent with other malignancies, TP53 mutations are associated 
with a poor prognosis and expected lack of response to DNA-damaging 
therapies.

ATM mutations, which are heterogeneous and occur throughout the 
gene, occur in 10–15% of CLL patients. ATM mutations often coexist 
with del(11)(q22.3), eliminating ATM on the alternate allele. Similar to 
TP53, mutations in ATM tend to result in impaired response to DNA 
damage, which can reduce responsiveness to chemotherapy.

In contrast to the aforementioned mutations, those in MYD88 tend 
to occur in IGHV mutated CLL and be associated with a more indolent 
prognosis. This gene is involved in Toll-like receptor signaling, and the 
most common mutation, L265P, results in constitutive activation and 
NF-κB activity.

Along with abnormalities in coding genes, it has become apparent 
that  noncoding  genes  such  as  microRNAs  are  recurrently  altered  in 
CLL.  The  most  common  cytogenetic  abnormality,  del(13)(q14.3), 
results in loss of the miR15/16 cluster, which is important in the patho-
genesis  of  CLL.  In  normal  cells,  miR15A/miR16A  inhibits  antiapop-
totic gene expression (including BCL2, CCND1, CCND3, and CDK6), 
and this specific deletion allows for overexpression of these genes and 
thus increased cell survival. Loss of other miR expression such as miR-
181a leads to overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins such as MCL-1 
and TCL1. Overexpression of miR-155, an onco-miR associated with B 
cell transformation, has also been documented in the majority of CLL 
patients.
 ■ IMMUNOLOGY
CLL is characterized by dysregulation of the normal immune system 
in addition to the malignant immune cells. Besides numerical abnor-
malities due to bone marrow dysfunction, even in the early stages of 
disease, there are skewed ratios of immune cells and functional abnor-
malities.  Innate  immune  system  defects  associated  with  CLL  include 

reduced  complement  proteins  and  activity,  qualitative  neutrophil 
defects, and functional defects of natural killer cells.

More  focus  has  been  placed  on  the  impairments  in  the  adaptive 
immune system in this disease. Within the CD4+ T-cell compartment, 
a  qualitative  defect  is  noted  similar  to  chronic  antigen  stimulation 
inducing  a  phenotype  of  T-cell  exhaustion  typical  of  what  is  seen  in 
chronic viral infections such as hepatitis. This has been demonstrated 
to lead to impaired T-cell cytotoxic capacity and reduced proliferative 
ability. Additionally, there are physical changes in the T-cell cytoskele-
ton that cause impaired immune synapse formation with antigen pre-
senting cells. In addition to a lack of capacity to respond to pathogens, 
the T-cell defect in CLL also likely leads to tumor cell tolerance. During 
the  course  of  the  disease,  the  polarization  of  the  CD4+  T  cells  shifts 
from  a  Th1  (cytotoxic)  phenotype  to  a  Th2  phenotype,  which  leads 
to expansion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin 10 
(IL-10).  Additionally,  in  the  later  stage  of  disease,  T  regulatory  cells 
are expanded, which contributes to an immunosuppressive phenotype.
Other  components  of  the  immune  microenvironment  are  altered 
as  well  to  form  a  more  supportive  environment  for  the  malignant 
cells.  M2  monocytes  have  been  shown  to  differentiate  into  a  type  of 
tumor-associated macrophage known as a nurse-like cell in CLL. These 
cells  promote  survival  by  secreting  chemokines  and  cytokines  that 
increase migration and activation.

The  humoral  immune  system  in  CLL  is  also  dysregulated,  as  is 
expected  for  a  malignancy  that  results  in  very  few  normal  B  cells. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia is very common and affects all subclasses of 
immunoglobulins, occurring in ~85% of patients at some time in their 
disease course, and is more common as disease progresses. A correla-
tion between low IgG and IgA and infection risk has been established, 
but isolated IgM reduction does not seem to be associated with excess 
infection risk. Also, CLL cells can secrete monoclonal IgM or IgG in a 
small number of cases, and this can correlate with disease progression.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS 
OF CLL
 ■ CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS
The  presentation  of  CLL  most  commonly  occurs  as  an  incidental 
diagnosis made at the time of medical evaluation for another cause. In 
this regard, CLL is most commonly diagnosed on routine blood work 
demonstrating  an  elevated  lymphocyte  count  in  asymptomatic  indi-
viduals,  although  some  patients  present  with  symptoms  and  require 
early  therapy.  When  noting  either  an  elevated  total  white  blood  cell 
(WBC) count with lymphocytic predominance or a normal WBC with 
a differential showing a lymphocytosis, the next step is to perform flow 
cytometry on the peripheral blood. In CLL, this will reveal the typical 
immunophenotype  that  includes  the  typical  B  cell  markers  CD19, 
CD20, CD22, and CD23; the T-cell marker CD5 (CD5 is also expressed 
on the B1 subset of B cells that typically has unmutated immunoglob-
ulin  and  responds  to  antigens  independent  of  cognate  T  cell  help); 
and  dim  surface  immunoglobulin  of  either  kappa  or  lambda  type  
(Table 107-2). Atypical phenotypes can be seen as well and usually can 
be differentiated on the basis of morphology, cytogenetics, or clinical 
presentation. In cases in which the clonal B cell count based on flow 
cytometry is ≥5 × 109/L, no further workup is needed to confirm the 
diagnosis of CLL.

Some patients will present with a small clonal proliferation of CLL 
cells  in  the  peripheral  blood  but  will  also  have  lymphadenopathy  or

splenomegaly. In these cases, the likely diagnosis is small lymphocytic 
lymphoma  (SLL),  a  semantic  designation  from  CLL  that  denotes  a 
primarily tissue-based disease rather than bone marrow/blood-based 
disease.  The  genetic  and  molecular  features  of  SLL  are  identical  to 
those of CLL. The retention of the cells in tissues may be related to the 
expression  of  a  particular  adhesion  molecule.  Thus,  SLL  patients  are 
managed  identically  to  CLL  patients,  and  often  in  the  later  stages  of 
disease, these patients will have blood and bone marrow involvement 
as well.

MONOCLONAL B-CELL LYMPHOCYTOSIS
Patients  who  do  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  CLL  based  on 
quantification  of  clonal  B  cells  in  the  peripheral  blood  and  who 
do  not  have  associated  signs  of  CLL  including  lymphadenopathy, 
organomegaly,  or  cytopenias  have  a  disorder  known  as  monoclonal 
B-cell  lymphocytosis  (MBL),  which  is  now  thought  to  precede  every 
case of CLL. Analogous to monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain sig-
nificance (MGUS) in myeloma, not all MBL progresses to CLL. MBL 
is initially characterized by a CLL-like immunophenotype in ~75% of 
cases but can also be atypical (CD23 negative or bright CD20) or CD5 
negative. More relevant for prognosis is characterization by count, with 
low-count MBL defining those patients with <0.5 × 109 clonal B cells/L, 
and  high-count  MBL  defining  those  with  >0.5  ×  109  but  <5  ×  109/L. 
Patients with low-count MBL have a negligible rate of progression to 
CLL, whereas those with high count progress to overt CLL at a rate of 
1–2%  per  year,  warranting  continued  monitoring.  Population-based 
studies  have  estimated  the  prevalence  of  MBL  to  be  up  to  ~12%  in 
the general population, where it is most common in elderly men. It is 
especially common in first-degree relatives of CLL patients, where the 
frequency is ~18%.

Although the risk of MBL progression is relatively low, it has become 
apparent  that  patients  still  experience  complications  that  suggest  an 
immune  dysfunction  in  MBL  that  is  similar  to  that  seen  with  CLL. 
Rates  of  serious  infections  requiring  hospitalization  appear  to  be 
significantly increased in MBL, similar to the rates seen in CLL. In a 
case-control study, patients with MBL had a 16% chance of hospitaliza-
tion over a 4-year time period, compared with 18.4% in patients with 
newly diagnosed CLL. Secondary cancers also appear to be increased 
in  MBL.  These  data  suggest  that  monitoring  for  patients  with  MBL 
should focus on vaccinations and age-appropriate cancer screening, as 
the probability of complications appears to be higher than the risk of 
progression in most of these patients. Follow-up for patients with MBL 
can occur with the primary care physician as this does not represent 
a malignancy, whereas CLL is mostly comanaged with both a primary 
care physician and a hematologist.

COMPLICATIONS OF CLL
A significant amount of morbidity and mortality related to CLL is due 
to complications of the disease. In general, complications besides dis-
ease  progression  include  infections,  secondary  cancers,  autoimmune 
complications, and transformation to a more aggressive clonally related 
lymphoma.
 ■ INFECTIONS
Infections  are  a  leading  cause  of  both  disease-related  morbidity  and 
death in patients with CLL, with ~30–50% of deaths in CLL patients 
attributed to infection. Owing to the immune dysfunction associated 
with  the  disease,  patients  are  at  risk  for  both  typical  and  atypical 
infections. Besides this baseline risk of infections, most CLL therapies 
can  increase  infection  risk.  For  many  nucleoside  analogue–based 
chemotherapy  regimens  used  in  CLL,  prophylaxis  for  Pneumocystis 
pneumonia  is  indicated  for  at  least  6  months  following  therapy  to 
allow recovery of functional T cells. Viral prophylaxis is also indicated 
for  many  chemotherapy  regimens  and  for  patients  with  a  history  of 
varicella-zoster to diminish reactivation and morbidity from this virus.
Because  of  the  abnormalities  in  cellular  and  humoral  immunity, 
vaccine  responses  in  CLL  are  limited  in  many  patients,  especially  in 
the later stages of disease. In one study, one dose of 13-valent pneumo-
coccal  vaccine  produced  an  adequate  immune  response  in  only  58% 

of patients compared with 100% in age-matched controls. Despite the 
known  limitations,  vaccination  against  influenza  and  pneumococcal 
pneumonia is recommended in CLL. The recombinant zoster vaccine 
has approximately a 60% response in previously untreated CLL, is safe, 
and should be considered for this patient group. In contrast, live vac-
cines should be avoided in the setting of CLL because of the small risk 
of viral reactivation with an immunocompromised host.

As  discussed  earlier,  hypogammaglobulinemia  is  common  in  CLL 
and can be associated with significant risk for infections, primarily of 
mucocutaneous etiology such as sinusitis and bronchitis. In addition, 
women can have frequent urinary tract infections. While administra-
tion of prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has not been 
shown to improve survival, it has been shown to reduce the number of 
minor or moderate bacterial infections and thus is indicated in patients 
with  hypogammaglobulinemia  who  suffer  from  recurrent  infections 
or  have  pulmonary  bronchiectasis.  We  also  administer  at  least  one 
dose of immunoglobulin to CLL patients who develop influenza with 
coexisting hypogammaglobulinemia to diminish risk of postinfluenza 
pneumococcal pneumonia. IVIg is also indicated in patients who have 
been hospitalized for a serious infection and in those whose IgG level 
is <300–500 mg/dL.

 ■ SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES
Multiple  population-based  studies  have  shown  that  patients  with 
CLL  are  at  an  elevated  risk  to  develop  other  cancers,  with  a  rate  up 
to  three  times  that  of  the  general  population,  even  in  the  absence  of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common types of cancers seen in 
CLL are skin, prostate, and breast cancers, although other cancers are 
seen as well. Skin cancers are particularly common, with a rate that is 
8- to 15-fold higher than in the general population, and may behave 
more  aggressively.  All  CLL  patients  should  be  counseled  on  the  use 
of  sunscreen  while  outdoors  and  should  undergo  preventative  skin 
examinations.

In one single-center study, older age at CLL diagnosis, male sex, high 
β2-microglobulin, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and chronic kidney 
disease  were  associated  with  excess  risk  of  other  cancers;  other  CLL- 
specific risk factors have not shown association with other cancer risk.

While  cancer  risk  is  higher,  no  specific  recommendations  for 
increased cancer screening in CLL patients have been validated. Age- 
and sex-appropriate screenings should be recommended.

Conflicting  data  exist  regarding  the  risk  of  cancers  following  CLL- 
specific therapy. Chemoimmunotherapy, in particular alkylator-containing 
regimens,  seems  to  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  secondary 
cancers. Secondary cancers are also seen in the setting of targeted thera-
pies. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors appear to have a secondary 
cancer risk similar to what is seen in the CLL population in general, but 
potentially a higher rate of nonmelanoma skin cancers. With short fol-
low-up, the risk of secondary cancers appears to be slightly higher with 
venetoclax-based  regimens  than  chlorambucil-based  chemoimmuno-
therapy, and further evaluation of this trend is ongoing.

 ■ AUTOIMMUNE COMPLICATIONS
Autoimmune  complications  are  frequent  in  CLL.  Most  commonly, 
these include autoimmune cytopenias, but autoimmune complications 
of other organs including glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and neurop-
athies  have  also  been  reported.  Of  the  autoimmune  cytopenias,  the 
most common is autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), which is an  
antibody-mediated destruction of autologous red blood cells (RBCs). 
Second  most  common  is  immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP),  which 
shares  some  features  with  AIHA  and  has  a  similar  mechanism  tar-
geting  platelets.  These  two  syndromes  may  occur  in  isolation,  occur 
sequentially in the same patient, or present in combination as Evan’s 
syndrome.  Pure  red  cell  aplasia  (PRCA)  and  autoimmune  granulo-
cytopenia  (AIG)  are  comparatively  rare  and  can  occur  alone  or  in 
combination with other autoimmune cytopenias. It is difficult to tease 
out whether autoimmune cytopenias lead to worse prognosis in CLL 
because of various complicating factors. However, it is clear that these 
can lead to significant morbidity, both due to the process itself and due 
to therapies required for management.

AIHA usually presents as an isolated anemia with an elevated retic-
ulocyte  count  and  features  of  hemolysis  including  elevated  bilirubin 
and LDH and low haptoglobin. Detection of a warm IgG antibody on 
the surface of RBCs with a Coombs test can help solidify the diagno-
sis, although Coombs-negative cases can occur. Immediate therapy is 
almost always necessary and consists of transfusion and immunosup-
pression. Glucocorticoids are often used for initial therapy, although in 
most cases, additional treatment is needed due to either poor response 
or  recurrence  with  taper  of  glucocorticoid  dosing.  Rituximab  can  be 
successful,  and  therapy  directed  toward  the  underlying  CLL  is  often 
effective in more resistant cases. Transfusion of blood in cases of robust 
AIHA must be initiated with caution as transfusion reactions can be 
seen  due  to  poorly  matched  blood,  but  should  be  pursued  in  those 
with severe, symptomatic anemia. Death from uncontrolled AIHA can 
occur in the absence of appropriate supportive care (Chap. 100).

ITP can be more difficult to diagnose as it may be difficult to differ-
entiate from progression of disease due to the lack of laboratory tests 
that identify platelet destruction from this mechanism. Signs that point 
toward  ITP  include  isolated  thrombocytopenia  and  rapid  decline  in 
platelet levels in the absence of an alternative etiology. A bone marrow 
biopsy  showing  normal  or  increased  megakaryocytes  can  be  used  to 
confirm the diagnosis but is often not necessary. In CLL, treatment for 
ITP is usually instituted when platelet levels drop to 20,000–30,000 or 
if evidence of bleeding complications or need for invasive procedures 
develops.  Like  AIHA,  initial  therapy  consists  of  glucocorticoids  and 
IVIg,  with  rituximab  also  being  an  effective  method  to  induce  long-
term remissions. Also, the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplos-
tim  and  eltrombopag  are  effective  in  secondary  ITP.  In  many  cases, 
ITP can be successfully treated without treating the underlying CLL. 
In  cases  in  which  anemia  or  thrombocytopenia  appears,  it  is  impor-
tant to investigate the mechanism because the approach to therapy of 
autoimmune cytopenias in CLL differs from cytopenias due to marrow 
replacement (Chap. 115).

 ■ RICHTER’S TRANSFORMATION
One of the most devastating complications of CLL is Richter’s transfor-
mation,  which  is  transformation  of  CLL  to  an  aggressive  lymphoma, 
most  commonly  DLBCL.  The  World  Health  Organization  also  rec-
ognizes  Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (HL)  as  a  variant  of  Richter’s  transfor-
mation; other aggressive lymphomas are rarely identified. Some older 
series  have  included  prolymphocytic  transformation  in  this  category, 
although this has much less prognostic impact on long-term outcome. 
The prevalence of Richter’s transformation is difficult to estimate based 
on previous studies, but one prospective observational study estimated 
a  rate  of  0.5%  per  year  for  DLBCL  and  0.05%  per  year  for  HL.  Risk 
factors  for  development  include  bulky  lymphadenopathy,  NOTCH1 
mutations,  del(17)(p13.1),  and  a  specific  stereotyped  IGHV  usage. 
Lymphomas arising in the setting of CLL can either be clonally related 
or unrelated to the initial CLL, with prognosis significantly better for 
clonally  unrelated  lymphomas.  In  addition,  patients  with  Hodgkin’s 
transformation  have  improved  outcome,  particularly  in  the  absence 
of prior fludarabine treatment. B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) 
arising from CLL is currently classified as Richter’s transformation as 
well; however, clinical features and therapy are quite different, so these 
two should be differentiated for therapeutic purposes.

Clinical signs of Richter’s transformation include rapid progression 
in  adenopathy,  often  in  a  specific  area,  and  constitutional  symptoms 
including fatigue, night sweats, fever, and weight loss. LDH is usually 
high. In suspected cases, the first step is 18FDG-PET/CT (fluorodeox-
yglucose–positron  emission  tomography  combined  with  computed 
tomography) scan to localize an area for biopsy. Standardized uptake 
values  (SUVs)  <5  are  consistent  with  CLL  and  can  rule  out  Richter’s 
transformation  in  many  cases.  SUVs  >5  are  suspicious  for  Richter’s 
transformation,  with  SUVs  ≥10  being  very  concerning.  Excisional 
biopsy is the preferred mode of diagnosis, and fine-needle aspiration 
should be discouraged.

Therapy for DLBCL Richter’s transformation usually involves com-
bination chemoimmunotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP [rituximab, cyclophos-
phamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  and  prednisolone],  dose-adjusted 

EPOCH-R  [etoposide,  prednisone,  vincristine,  cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and rituximab]; Chap. 108). Outcomes may be poor with 
median  survivals  of  6–16  months  in  most  series  for  clonally  related 
Richter’s  versus  ~5  years  for  clonally  unrelated.  For  fit  patients  who 
achieve  a  response  with  therapy,  stem  cell  transplantation  has  the 
possibility to induce long-term remissions and should be explored. In 
addition, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has shown 
promising results in small groups of patients and remains an area of 
active  clinical  investigation.  Patients  with  Hodgkin’s  disease  can  be 
treated according to the algorithm for this disease, with many individ-
uals being cured.

WORKUP OF CLL AND APPROACH TO 
THERAPY
 ■ WORKUP AND STAGING
Workup  of  a  patient  with  a  new  diagnosis  of  CLL  based  on  typical 
immunophenotyping  includes  a  detailed  history  of  infectious  disease; 
family history of CLL; and careful physical examination with attention 
to the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. In patients desiring to know the 
expected  natural  history  of  their  CLL,  prognostic  testing  using  FISH 
and stimulated karyotype and sequencing for TP53 and IGHV mutation 
status can be performed. Imaging with CT scan is usually not necessary 
unless there are symptoms and concern for intraabdominal nodes out of 
proportion to peripheral nodes. Bone marrow biopsy is not undertaken 
until therapy is initiated except in cases of unexplained cytopenias.
 ■ STAGING
There  are  two  widely  used  staging  systems  in  CLL.  The  Rai  staging 
system is used more commonly in the United States, whereas the Binet 
system is more commonly used in Europe. Both characterize CLL on 
the basis of disease bulk and marrow failure (Table 107-3). Both rely 
on  physical  examination  and  laboratory  studies  and  do  not  require 
imaging  or  bone  marrow  analysis.  While  the  initial  staging  systems 
could  reliably  predict  survival  in  CLL,  with  the  changes  in  therapy 
since the original description of the stages, the impact of initial stage 
on survival is not as clear. Cytogenetic and genomic testing can help 
refine outcomes of these staging tests. An international collaboration 
integrated both clinical and genomic staging to better predict outcome 
at diagnosis and time of initial treatment, which led to development of 
the CLL International Prognostic Index (Table 107-4). This index has 
been shown to be useful in prediction of both time to first treatment 
and outcome with chemoimmunotherapy. Validation in the setting of 
novel targeted therapies has not occurred.
 ■ CRITERIA FOR THE INITIATION OF THERAPY
Currently,  a  watchful  waiting  strategy  is  used  for  most  patients  with 
CLL,  with  therapy  reserved  for  patients  with  symptomatic  disease. 
This recommendation is based on multiple trials showing no survival 
advantage with earlier therapy, although this question continues to be 
a focus of active investigation.

With  the  exception  of  patients  participating  on  early  intervention 
studies in CLL, disease-related symptoms that require the initiation of 
therapy are outlined in  Table 107-5. Except for the rare patient who

toms can be monitored over short periods to determine relatedness to 
CLL and need for therapy.
 ■ INITIAL THERAPY FOR CLL
Over  the  past  decade,  the  initial  therapy  of  CLL  has  dramatically 
changed.  Whereas  chemoimmunotherapy  was  once  standard  for  all 
patients,  now  most  patients  are  treated  with  oral  therapies  targeted 
against BTK or BCL2 with or without a CD20 monoclonal antibody. 
This continues to be an area of active investigation, with standards of 
care shifting rapidly. The major classes of these therapies are outlined 
here.

BTK Inhibitors  BTK is an attractive target in CLL because, unlike 
other kinases in the BCR pathway, BTK does not have natural redun-
dancy  and  is  relatively  selective  for  B  cells,  so  inhibition  leads  to  a 
predominant B cell–specific phenotype. The first-in-class BTK inhib-
itor is ibrutinib, which is relatively selective for BTK but also inhibits 
a  number  of  structurally  similar  kinases.  As  initial  therapy,  ibrutinib 
was initially compared with chlorambucil (RESONATE 2 study), and 
there was an 84% lower risk of progression or death with ibrutinib, with 
70% of ibrutinib-treated patients alive and progression-free at 5 years. 
Subsequent  studies  compared  ibrutinib  alone  or  with  the  anti-CD20 
antibody  rituximab  to  standard  chemoimmunotherapy  with  fludara-
bine plus cyclophosphamide plus rituximab (FCR) in younger patients 
(<70 years; E1912 study) or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) in older 
patients (≥65 years; A041202 study). In younger patients, ibrutinib plus 
rituximab (IR) showed increased progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) when compared with FCR, with a 3-year PFS of 
89%  for  IR  compared  with  71%  for  FCR.  In  older  patients,  ibrutinib 
alone as well as with rituximab showed superior PFS compared with 
BR, with 24-month PFS rates of 88% for IR, 87% for ibrutinib alone,

and 74% for BR. IR was not superior to ibrutinib alone, and OS was 
not different in this trial at 24 months. Side effects distinct to ibrutinib 
include arthralgias/myalgias, rash, diarrhea, dyspepsia, increased risk 
of bleeding (particularly when on anticoagulation therapy or with sur-
gery), hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

The second-generation BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib is more specific 
for  BTK  than  ibrutinib  and  consequentially  shows  better  tolerability, 
with less incidence of atrial fibrillation, myalgias/arthralgias, and skin 
and nail changes than reported with ibrutinib. In the frontline setting, 
acalabrutinib  and  acalabrutinib  plus  obinutuzumab  were  compared 
with  chlorambucil  plus  obinutuzumab.  Both  acalabrutinib  alone  and 
acalabrutinib  with  obinutuzumab  showed  superior  30-month  PFS 
compared with chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (82%, 90%, and 34%, 
respectively), with improved PFS for acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab 
compared with acalabrutinib alone in an unplanned post hoc analysis.

BCL2  Inhibitor  Venetoclax  is  an  orally  bioavailable,  selective 
inhibitor  of  the  antiapoptotic  protein  BCL2,  which  is  upregulated  in 
CLL.  Unlike  with  BTK  inhibitors,  where  many  phase  3  studies  sup-
port  benefit  over  chemoimmunotherapy,  only  one  study  has  been 
published  with  venetoclax.  The  CLL14  study  compared  venetoclax 
plus obinutuzumab (VO) to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab in pre-
viously untreated patients with coexisting medical conditions. Unlike 
BTK  inhibitors,  which  are  administered  continuously  until  disease 
progression,  VO  treatment  is  given  for  a  1-year  fixed  duration.  At  
3  years  of  follow-up,  PFS  was  82%  in  the  VO  group  compared  with 
50% in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab group. No difference has 
been observed in OS with this follow-up. Side effects associated with 
venetoclax include tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia, and nausea.

PI3K  Inhibitors 
Inhibitors  of  PI3K  delta  have  been  studied  in 
CLL due to the specificity of the delta isoform for B lymphocytes. Two 
agents, idelalisib and duvelisib, are approved for use in relapsed CLL, 
but trials of idelalisib in frontline CLL demonstrated toxicity that pre-
cluded further development in this area. Toxicities seen with idelalisib 
and duvelisib include pneumonitis, diarrhea/colitis, and transaminitis. 
More  recently,  a  second-generation  PI3K  delta  inhibitor  umbralisib 
was combined with the anti-CD20 antibody ublituximab in the front-
line  setting  and  compared  with  chlorambucil  plus  obinutuzumab. 
Twenty-four-month  PFS  was  61%  for  ublituximab  plus  umbralisib 
compared  with  40%  with  chlorambucil  plus  obinutuzumab.  PI3K 
inhibitor–specific toxicities appear to be lower with umbralisib com-
pared with idelalisib and duvelisib, but comparative trials are lacking. 
As outcome with this combination appears inferior to that with BTK 
inhibitors or BCL2 inhibitors, it is unlikely this treatment will be used 
in CLL outside of rare circumstances where other classes of drugs are 
contraindicated.

Chemoimmunotherapy  For  the  most  part,  targeted  therapy 
has  supplanted  chemoimmunotherapy  in  CLL.  However,  long-term  
follow-up of studies of FCR has demonstrated that a subset of patients 
treated  with  this  regimen  can  have  durable  responses  over  10  years, 
with  a  likely  cure  of  CLL.  This  group  is  composed  almost  exclu-
sively  of  patients  with  mutated  IGHV  and  favorable  cytogenetics. 
However,  despite  the  efficacy  of  this  regimen,  short-  and  long-term 
toxicities  limit  its  adaptability  to  many  patients  with  IGHV  mutated 
disease.  Short-term  toxicities  are  mostly  related  to  myelosuppression 
and  include  neutropenia  and  infection.  Long-term  cytopenias  are 
less  common,  but  they  do  occur.  Also,  there  is  about  a  3–5%  risk  of  
therapy-related  myeloid  neoplasm  with  this  regimen  that  is  almost 
always fatal. In the E1912 study of FCR versus IR, at follow-up, there 
was no difference in PFS or OS between FCR and IR for patients with 
mutated IGHV, suggesting that there may remain a place for this reg-
imen  in  clinical  practice.  In  addition,  current  studies  are  focused  on 
limiting chemotherapy and/or adding novel agents in efforts to achieve 
cure but limit toxicity.

CLL has not been established; however, the available data suggest that 
the sequence of either BTK inhibitor and then BCL2 inhibitor or the 
reverse are both acceptable. In a trial of venetoclax for patients who had 
relapsed  after  ibrutinib  therapy,  the  overall  response  rate  (ORR)  was 
65% with a median PFS of ~2 years in a very heavily pretreated patient 
population. Retrospective data of BTK inhibitor given after venetoclax 
suggests that this sequence is effective as well, with an ORR of 84% and 
median PFS of 32 months. PI3K inhibitors also have activity in relapsed 
CLL;  however,  activity  following  both  BTK  and  BCL2  inhibitors  is 
likely  minimal.  In  addition,  many  new  agents  are  in  development  in 
CLL including novel oral targeted therapies, antibodies, and immune-
based treatments.

Immune  Therapies 
Immune  therapies  in  CLL  are  currently 
focused in the relapsed setting and include allogenic stem cell trans-
plantation, CAR-T therapy, and oral immunomodulatory agents such 
as lenalidomide.

Stem  cell  transplantation  is  a  curative  approach  to  CLL.  Because 
most CLL patients are older and many have significant comorbidities, 
myeloablative transplantations incur extensive morbidity and mortal-
ity,  making  them  prohibitive  in  many  individuals.  Reduced-intensity 
conditioning (RIC) allogeneic transplantations have been successfully 
incorporated into the treatment of patients up to ~75 years in age but 
still have a ≥50% frequency of chronic graft-versus-host disease. This is 
still considered a standard treatment in CLL but has fallen out of favor 
with the introduction of well-tolerated novel agents, as well as clinical 
trials of CAR-T cells. CD19 CAR-T cell trials have not been as success-
ful in CLL as they have been in other B cell malignancies due to the 
immunosuppression  associated  with  the  disease.  Many  current  trials 
are focused on optimizing CD19 CAR-T cells by adding agents such as 
BTK inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors or modifying the CAR-T structure, 
and other studies are testing different targets outside of CD19. In addi-
tion, recent studies have shown that natural killer (NK) cell CAR cells 
also can induce clinical response in CLL patients. This area remains a 
focus of intense investigation in CLL.

 ■ ASSESSING RESPONSE TO THERAPY AND 
MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN CLL
Following the completion of therapy or during therapy for indefinite 
targeted  agents,  response  is  initially  assessed  using  physical  exami-
nation  and  laboratory  studies  (Table  107-6).  If  residual  disease  is 
not  detected  using  these  methodologies,  CT  scans  are  used  to  assess 
response. Bone marrow biopsies with flow cytometry are indicated if 
no disease is detected to confirm complete response.

It has been established in various malignancies that complete tumor 
eradication is associated with longer survival. In CLL, if no malignant 
cells can be detected in the bone marrow down to a level of 1 CLL cell 

in 104 leukocytes (0.01%), the patient is said to be negative for minimal 
residual  disease  (MRD).  Following  combination  chemoimmunother-
apy, eradication of MRD correlates with long-term survival and poten-
tially cure in a subset of patients receiving FCR chemoimmunotherapy. 
Undetectable  MRD  in  blood  or  bone  marrow  is  also  associated  with 
improvement  in  PFS  in  venetoclax-based  regimens.  However,  eradi-
cation of MRD has not been shown to be a meaningful endpoint with 
BTK or PI3K inhibitors as monotherapy. Higher sensitivity of 1 CLL 
in  106  leukocytes  (0.0001%)  can  be  obtained  using  next-generation 
sequencing  methods  such  as  ClonoSeq.  This  technique  is  currently 
available in clinical practice, although at this point, there are no data 
confirming  that  increased  sensitivity  is  clinically  meaningful,  and 
studies  are  underway  to  support  the  need  for  this  higher  sensitivity 
with novel combination approaches of BTK/BCL2 inhibitor regimens.
 ■ CONCLUSION
CLL is treated only when it becomes symptomatic. At the time of ther-
apy,  FCR  chemoimmunotherapy  in  a  small  subset  of  young  patients 
with  very-good-risk  CLL  is  potentially  curative.  In  the  majority  of 
patients  with  symptomatic  CLL,  targeted  therapy  directed  at  BTK  or 
BCL2 can produce durable remissions and allow patients many years 
of disease-free survival.

108 Non-Hodgkin’s  
Lymphoma
Caron A. Jacobson, Dan L. Longo

Non-Hodgkin’s  lymphomas  (NHL)  are  cancers  of  mature  B,  T,  and 
natural  killer  (NK)  cells.  They  were  distinguished  from  Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma  (HL)  upon  recognition  of  the  Reed-Sternberg  (RS)  cell 
and  differ  from  HL  with  respect  to  their  biologic  and  clinical  char-
acteristics.  Whereas  ∼80–85%  of  patients  with  HL  will  be  cured  of 
their  lymphoma  by  chemotherapy  with  or  without  radiotherapy,  the 
prognosis and natural history of NHL tends to be more variable. NHL 
can  be  classified  as  either  a  mature  B-NHL  or  a  mature  T/NK-NHL 
depending on whether the cancerous lymphocyte is a B, T, or NK cell, 
respectively.  Within  each  category  are  lymphomas  that  grow  quickly 
and behave aggressively, as well as lymphomas that are more indolent, 
or slow growing, in nature. For a list of the World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms, see Table 108-1.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY
In  2020,  >77,000  new  cases  of  NHL  were  diagnosed  in  the  United 
States, ∼4% of all new cancers in both males and females, making it the 
seventh most common cause of cancer-related death in both women 
and men. The incidence is nearly 10 times the incidence of HL. There 
is  a  slight  male-to-female  predominance  and  a  higher  incidence  for 
Caucasians  than  for  African  Americans.  The  incidence  rises  steadily 
with  age,  especially  after  age  40,  but  lymphomas  are  also  among  the 
most  common  malignancies  in  adolescent  and  young  adult  patients. 
The incidence of NHL has nearly doubled over the past 20–40 years 
and continues to rise by 1.5–2% each year. Patients with both primary

and secondary immunodeficiency states are predisposed to developing 
NHL.  These  include  patients  with  HIV  infection,  patients  who  have 
undergone organ transplantation, and patients with inherited immune 
deficiencies and autoimmune conditions. The 5-year survival rates for 
NHL are 72% for Caucasians and 63% for African Americans.

The incidence of NHL and the patterns of expression of the various 
subtypes  differ  geographically  and  across  age  groups.  T-cell  lympho-
mas  are  more  common  in  Asia  than  in  Western  countries,  whereas 
certain subtypes of B-cell lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma (FL) 
are  more  common  in  Western  countries.  A  specific  subtype  of  NHL 
known  as  the  angiocentric  nasal  T/NK  cell  lymphoma  has  a  striking 
geographic occurrence, being most frequent in southern Asia and parts 
of Latin America. Another subtype of NHL associated with infection 
by  human  T-cell  lymphotropic  virus  (HTLV)  1  is  seen  particularly 
in southern Japan and the Caribbean. Likewise, there are differences 
in  the  age-dependent  incidence  of  NHL  by  histologic  subtype,  with 
aggressive  lymphomas  like  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL) 
and  Burkitt’s  lymphoma  (BL)  being  the  most  common  entities  in 
children, and DLBCL and indolent lymphomas including FL being the 
most common forms in adults. The relative frequencies of the various 
types of lymphoid malignancies, including HL, plasma cell disorders, 
and lymphoid leukemias, is shown in Fig. 108-1.

A  number  of  environmental  factors  have  been  implicated  in  the 
occurrence of NHL, including infectious agents, chemical exposures, 
and medical treatments. Several studies have demonstrated an associa-
tion between exposure to agricultural chemicals and an increased inci-
dence of NHL. Patients treated for HL can develop NHL; it is unclear 
whether  this  is  a  consequence  of  the  HL  or  its  treatment,  especially 
radiation.

Several  NHLs  are  associated  with  infectious  agents  (Table 108-2). 
Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV)  is  associated  with  the  development  of  BL 
in Central Africa and the occurrence of aggressive NHL in immuno-
suppressed  patients  in  Western  countries.  The  majority  of  primary 
central  nervous  system  (CNS)  lymphomas  are  associated  with  EBV. 
EBV infection is strongly associated with the occurrence of extranodal 
nasal  NK/T-cell  lymphomas  in  Asia  and  South  America.  HTLV-1 
infects  T  cells  and  leads  directly  to  the  development  of  adult  T-cell 
lymphoma (ATL) in a small percentage of patients infected as babies 
through ingestion of breast milk of infected mothers. The median age 
of patients with ATL is ∼56 years; thus, HTLV-1 demonstrates a long 
latency from infection to oncogenesis (Chap. 201). Infection with HIV 
predisposes  to  the  development  of  aggressive,  B-cell  NHL.  This  may 
be through overexpression of interleukin 6 by infected macrophages. 
Infection of the stomach by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori induces 
the development of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) 
lymphomas.  This  association  is  supported  by  evidence  that  patients 
treated with antibiotics to eradicate H. pylori have regression of their 
MALT lymphoma. The bacterium does not transform lymphocytes to 
produce the lymphoma; instead, a vigorous immune response is made 
to  the  bacterium,  and  the  chronic  antigenic  stimulation  leads  to  the 
neoplasia.  MALT  lymphomas  of  the  skin  may  be  related  to  Borrelia 
sp.  infections  in  Europe,  those  of  the  eyes  to  Chlamydophila  psittaci, 
and those of the small intestine to Campylobacter jejuni. Chronic hep-
atitis  C  virus  infection  has  been  associated  with  the  development  of 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma 
(MZL). Human herpesvirus 8 is associated with primary effusion lym-
phoma in HIV-infected persons and multicentric Castleman’s disease, a 
diffuse lymphadenopathy associated with systemic symptoms of fever, 
malaise, and weight loss.

In addition to infectious agents, a number of other diseases or expo-
sures may predispose to developing lymphoma (Table 108-3). Diseases 
of  inherited  and  acquired  immunodeficiency  as  well  as  autoimmune 
diseases  are  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  lymphoma. 
The association between immunosuppression and induction of NHLs 
is  compelling  because  if  the  immunosuppression  can  be  reversed,  a 
percentage of these lymphomas regress spontaneously. The incidence 
of  NHL  is  nearly  a  hundredfold  increased  for  patients  undergoing 
organ  transplantation  necessitating  chronic  immunosuppression  and 
is greatest in the first year posttransplant. About 30% of these arise as

a polyclonal B-cell proliferation that evolves into a clonal B cell malig-
nancy. The NHLs that occur in the context of immunosuppression or 
immunodeficiency, including HIV infection, are frequently associated 
with EBV. Histologically, DLBCLs are most frequently associated with 
immunosuppression  and  autoimmune  diseases,  although  almost  all 
histologies  can  be  seen,  especially  MALT  lymphomas  in  the  context 
of autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome and Hashimoto’s 
thyroiditis.  The  rare  inherited  immunodeficiency  diseases  X-linked 
lymphoproliferative  syndrome,  Wiskott-Aldrich  syndrome,  Chédiak- 
Higashi  syndrome,  ataxia-telangiectasia,  and  common  variable 
immunodeficiency  syndrome  are  complicated  by  highly  aggressive 
lymphomas. The elevated incidence of lymphoma in iatrogenic immu-
nosuppression,  AIDS,  and  autoimmune  disease  argues  strongly  for 
immune dysregulation contributing in the pathogenesis of some lym-
phomas. An increased risk of NHL has been observed in first-degree 
relatives  with  NHL,  HL,  or  chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL).  In 
large database studies, ∼9% of patients with lymphoma or CLL have a 
first-degree relative with a lymphoproliferative disorder.

 ■ IMMUNOLOGY
All  lymphoid  cells  are  derived  from  a  common  hematopoietic  pro-
genitor  that  gives  rise  to  lymphoid,  myeloid,  erythroid,  monocyte, 
and  megakaryocyte  lineages.  Through  the  ordered  and  sequential 
activation  of  a  series  of  transcription  factors,  the  cell  first  becomes 
committed to the lymphoid lineage and then gives rise to B and T cells.
About  90%  of  all  lymphomas  are  of  B  cell  origin.  A  cell  becomes 
committed to B cell development when it expresses the master B lin-
eage transcription factor PAX5, which ultimately results in a transcrip-
tional program that leads to the rearrangement of its immunoglobulin 
genes, which involves chromosomal recombination as well as somatic 
hypermutation  to  create  an  immunoglobulin  gene  that  is  unique  to 
that  B  cell.  The  sequence  of  cellular  changes,  including  changes  in 
cell-surface phenotype that characterizes normal B cell development, 
is  shown  in  Fig.  108-2.  Most  B-cell  lymphomas  arise  following  the 
process  of  immunoglobulin  gene  recombination  and  somatic  hyper-
mutation, which leads to class switching and affinity maturation of the 
mature  immunoglobulin,  respectively,  suggesting  that  it  is  the  error-
prone  nature  of  these  genetic  events  that  contributes  to  oncogenesis. 
Certainly the frequency of chromosomal translocations that result in 
the activation of an oncogene or the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor 
gene in B-cell NHL may be the result of these normal cellular processes 
gone awry (see below). In addition, the key roles of the transcription 
factors  MYC  and  BCL6  and  the  antiapoptotic  protein  BCL2  in  the

FIGURE 108-2  Pathway of normal B-cell differentiation and relationship to B-cell lymphomas. HLA-DR, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD5, and CD38 are cell markers 
used to distinguish stages of development. Terminal transferase (TdT) is a cellular enzyme. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement (HCR) and light chain gene 
rearrangement or deletion (κR or D, λR or D) occur early in B-cell development. The approximate normal stage of differentiation associated with particular lymphomas is 
shown. ALL, acute lymphoid leukemia; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; SL, small lymphocytic lymphoma.

process  of  B  cell  development  explain  why  the  genes  encoding  these 
proteins are commonly mutated in B-cell lymphomas.

A cell becomes committed to T-cell differentiation upon migration 
to the thymus and rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. This 
requires  the  expression  of  the  T-cell  master  regulatory  transcription 
factor, NOTCH-1. As in B cells, the development of the mature TCR 
involves the rearrangement and recombination of the TCR loci, which 
is error-prone and potentially oncogenic. The sequence of the events 
that characterize T-cell development is depicted in Fig. 108-3.

Although  lymphoid  malignancies  often  retain  the  cell-surface 
phenotype  of  lymphoid  cells  at  particular  stages  of  differentiation, 
this  information  is  of  little  clinical  or  prognostic  consequence.  The 
so-called  stage  of  differentiation  of  a  malignant  lymphoma  does  not 
predict  its  natural  history.  The  antigen  footprint,  or  immunopheno-
type, of the cell, however, is valuable diagnostically as it allows for the 
distinguishing  of  specific  NHL  subtypes.  It  can  be  detected  by  flow 
cytometry  of  single-cell  suspension  from  blood,  bone  marrow,  body 
fluid,  or  disaggregated  tissue  using  fluorescently  labeled  antibodies 
against these antigens or by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin- 
embedded tissue sections with enzyme-linked antibodies against these 
antigens followed by a colorimetric reaction.

As  already  mentioned,  malignancies  of  lymphoid  cells  are  asso-
ciated  with  recurring  genetic  abnormalities  including  chromosomal 
translocations and genetic mutations that may in part be the result of 
aberrant immunoglobulin or TCR development. While specific genetic 
abnormalities  have  not  been  identified  for  all  subtypes  of  lymphoid 
malignancies, it is presumed that they exist. As previously discussed, 
B cells are even more susceptible to acquiring mutations during their 

maturation in germinal centers; the generation of antibody of higher 
affinity requires the introduction of mutations into the variable region 
genes in the germinal centers. Given this, other nonimmunoglobulin 
genes, e.g., bcl-6, may acquire mutations as well. Likewise, many lym-
phomas  contain  balanced  chromosomal  translocations  involving  the 
antigen receptor genes; immunoglobulin genes on chromosomes 2, 14, 
and 22 in B cells; and T-cell antigen receptor genes on chromosomes 
7  and  14  in  T  cells.  The  rearrangement  of  chromosome  segments  to 
generate  mature  antigen  receptors  must  create  a  site  of  vulnerability 
to  aberrant  recombination.  Examples  of  this  type  of  event  include 
the  (8;14)(q24;q32)  translocation  in  BL,  involving  the  MYC  proto- 
oncogene and the IgH gene; the (14;18)(q32;q32) translocation in FL, 
involving the BCL2 proto-oncogene and the IgH gene; and the (11;14) 
(q13;q32) translocation in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), involving the 
gene encoding cyclin D1 (CCDN1) and the IgH gene. Less commonly, 
chromosomal  translocations  produce  fusion  genes  that  encode  chi-
meric oncogenic proteins. Examples of this include the (2;5)(p23;q35) 
translocation  involving  the  ALK  and  NPM1  genes  in  anaplastic 
large-cell  lymphoma  (ALCL)  and  the  t(11;18)(q21;q21)  translocation 
involving the API2 and MLT genes in MALT lymphoma. Table 108-4 
presents  the  most  common  translocations  and  associated  oncogenes 
for various subtypes of lymphoid malignancies.

Gene  profiling  using  array  technology  allows  the  simultaneous 
assessment  of  the  expression  of  thousands  of  genes.  This  technology 
provides the possibility to identify new genes with pathologic impor-
tance in lymphomas, the identification of patterns of gene expression 
with diagnostic and/or prognostic significance, and the identification 
of new therapeutic targets. Recognition of patterns of gene expression

is  complicated  and  requires  sophisticated  mathematical  techniques. 
Early successes using this technology in lymphoma include the iden-
tification of previously unrecognized subtypes of DLBCL whose gene 
expression patterns resemble either those of follicular or germinal cen-
ter B (GCB) cells or activated peripheral blood B cells (ABC). Patients 
whose  lymphomas  have  a  GCB-like  pattern  of  gene  expression  have 
a considerably better prognosis than those whose lymphomas have a 
pattern  resembling  ABCs.  This  improved  prognosis  is  independent 
of  other  known  prognostic  factors.  These  subcategories  have  been 
more specifically refined into five subcategories, using more advanced 
genetic sequencing techniques, that differ with respect to biology and 
driver genes, as well as prognosis, and may have important treatment 
implications  in  the  future.  Similar  information  is  being  generated  in 
FL and MCL. The challenge remains to provide information from such 
techniques in a clinically useful time frame.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Regardless of the type of lymphoid malignancy, the initial evalua-
tion of the patient should include performance of a careful history 
and  physical  examination.  These  will  help  confirm  the  diagnosis, 
identify  those  manifestations  of  the  disease  that  might  require 
prompt  attention,  and  aid  in  the  selection  of  further  studies  to 
optimally characterize the patient’s status to allow the best choice 
of therapy. It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of a care-
fully  done  history  and  physical  examination.  They  might  provide 
observations that lead to reconsidering the diagnosis, provide hints 
at  etiology,  clarify  the  stage,  and  allow  the  physician  to  establish 
rapport with the patient that will make it possible to develop and 
carry out a therapeutic plan.

The duration of symptoms and pace of symptomatic progression 
are  important  in  distinguishing  aggressive  from  more  indolent 
lymphomas,  as  are  the  presence  or  absence  of  “B”  symptoms, 
such  as  fevers,  night  sweats,  or  unexplained  weight  loss.  Patients 
should be asked about localizing symptoms that may point toward 
lymphomatous  involvement  of  specific  sites,  such  as  the  chest, 
abdomen,  or  CNS.  Comorbid  diagnoses  that  may  impact  therapy 
or monitoring on therapy should be reviewed and acknowledged, 
including a history of diabetes or congestive heart failure. A phys-
ical examination should pay close attention to all the peripherally 
accessible sites of lymph nodes; the liver and spleen size; Waldeyer’s 
ring; whether there is a pleural or pericardial effusion or abdominal 
ascites;  whether  there  is  an  abdominal,  testicular,  or  breast  mass; 
and  whether  there  is  cutaneous  involvement  because  all  of  these 
findings may influence further evaluation and disease management.
Laboratory  studies  should  include  a  complete  blood  count, 
routine  chemistries,  liver  function  tests,  and  serum  protein  elec-
trophoresis  to  document  the  presence  of  circulating  monoclonal 
paraproteins. The serum β2-microglobulin level and serum lactate 
dehydrogenase  (LDH)  are  important  independent  prognostic  fac-
tors in NHL. Staging of certain diseases may involve a bone marrow 
biopsy;  results  of  other  laboratory  and  staging  studies  may  also 
warrant  a  marrow  evaluation.  A  lumbar  puncture  for  evaluation 
of  lymphomatous  involvement  may  be  indicated  in  the  setting  of 
concerning neurologic signs or symptoms or diseases that are high 
risk for CNS involvement. The latter may include disease involving 
the  paranasal  sinuses,  testes,  breast,  kidneys,  adrenal  glands,  and 
epidural  space,  as  well  as  highly  aggressive  histologies  like  BL. 
Since HIV and hepatitis B and C infection can be risk factors for 
developing NHL, and since treatment for some NHLs can result in 
the potentially life-threatening reactivation of hepatitis B, patients 
with a new diagnosis of NHL should be screened for these viruses 
as well.

Lymphoma  histology  and  clinical  presentation  dictate  which 
imaging  studies  should  be  ordered.  Chest,  abdominal,  and  pelvic 
computed  tomography  (CT)  scans  are  essential  for  accurate  stag-
ing  to  assess  lymphadenopathy  for  indolent  lymphomas,  whereas 
positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose

(FDG-PET)  is  useful  for  aggressive  lymphomas,  including  BL, 
DLBCL, plasmablastic lymphoma, and the aggressive T-cell NHLs. 
FDG-PET  is  highly  sensitive  for  detecting  both  nodal  and  extra-
nodal  sites  involved  by  NHL.  The  intensity  of  FDG  avidity,  or 
standardized uptake value (SUV), correlates with histologic aggres-
siveness,  and  may  be  useful  in  cases  when  disease  transformation 
of an indolent lymphoma to a diffuse aggressive lymphoma is sus-
pected. PET scanning can also differentiate between treated disease 
and  active  disease  at  the  end  of  therapy  in  patients  with  residual 
masses  on  CT  scans.  Consensus  recommendations  regarding  PET 
scanning  were  published  as  a  result  of  an  International  Harmoni-
zation Project and state that PET should only be used for DLBCL 
and HL, that scanning during therapy should only be done as part 
of clinical trials, and that the end-of-treatment scan should not be 
done before 3 weeks but preferably 6–8 weeks after chemotherapy 
and 8–12 weeks after radiation or chemoradiotherapy. There is no 
evidence  that  long-term  follow-up  should  include  PET  scanning. 
More  recently,  though,  PET  scan  results  at  the  end  of  therapy  for 
FL have been associated with prognosis, with patients with residual 
PET-avid disease at the end of treatment having a poorer prognosis 
than  those  who  are  PET  negative,  and  so  it  may  be  used  for  this 
prognostic purpose. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is 
useful in detecting bone, bone marrow, and CNS disease in the brain 
and spinal cord. The staging evaluation is outlined in Table 108-5.

The  Ann  Arbor  staging  system  developed  in  1971  for  HL  was 
adapted  for  staging  NHLs  (Table  108-6).  This  staging  system 
focuses  on  the  number  of  tumor  sites  (nodal  and  extranodal),

location, and the presence or absence of systemic, or B, symptoms. 
Table  108-6  summarizes  the  essential  features  of  the  Ann  Arbor 
system.

This  anatomic  based  system  is  less  useful  in  NHL,  which  dis-
seminates  widely,  not  in  an  ordered  stepwise  fashion.  A  majority 
of  patients  with  NHL  have  advanced-stage  disease  at  diagnosis. 
Apart  from  early-stage  disease  limited  to  a  radiation  field  where 
local therapy with radiation is an option, all other disease is treated 
the  same  regardless  of  stage.  Histology  and  clinical  parameters  at 
presentation are more important than stage with respect to prog-
nosis. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is perhaps the best 
predictor of outcome (Table 108-7). The IPI was developed based 
on the analysis of >2000 patients with aggressive NHLs treated with 
an  anthracycline-containing  regimen.  Age  (≤60  vs  >60),  serum 
LDH (≤ normal vs > normal), performance status (0 or 1 vs 2–4), 
stage (I or II vs III or IV), and extranodal involvement (<1 site vs 
>1  site)  were  identified  as  independently  prognostic  for  overall 
survival  (OS).  A  point  is  awarded  for  each  risk  factor  and  then 
summed, defining four risk groups: low (0 or 1); low-intermediate 
(2);  high-intermediate  (3);  and  high  (4–5).  The  5-year  OS  rates 
for  patients  with  scores  of  0  to  1,  2,  3,  and  4–5  were  73,  51,  43, 
and 26%, respectively. The age-adjusted IPI separates patients ≤60 
from patients >60. For the age-adjusted IPI, only stage, LDH, and 
performance status were important. Younger patients with 0, 1, 2, 
or  3  risk  factors  had  5-year  survival  rates  of  83,  69,  46,  and  32%, 
compared to 56, 44, 37, and 21% for older patients. When factoring 
in  the  introduction  and  clinical  benefit  of  rituximab,  the  4-year 
progression-free survival rates are 94, 80, and 53% for 0 and 1, 2, or 
3 or more risk factors, respectively.

The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) 
is  a  similar  predictive  model  for  FL,  derived  from  the  analysis  of 
>4000  patients.  Age  >60,  stage  III/IV  disease,  the  presence  of  >4 
nodal sites, an elevated serum LDH concentration, and a hemoglo-
bin  <12  were  identified  as  independent  prognostic  variables,  and 
summation of each variable identified three risk groups. The median 
10-year survival rates for patients with zero to one (low risk), two 
(intermediate  risk),  or  three  or  more  (high  risk)  of  these  adverse 
factors were 71, 51, and 36%, respectively. Similar disease-specific 
IPIs have been developed for MCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma 
(PTCL) as well. These prognostic indices take into account the pro-
liferative index and cell-surface markers, respectively.

Finally,  as  mentioned  previously,  gene  expression  profiling  has 
identified  DLBCLs  with  differential  prognoses:  GCB  and  ABC, 
where  GCB-like  DLBCL  is  associated  with  a  significantly  better

OS. A more readily accessible immunohistochemical algorithm has 
been developed, based on the presence of absence of CD10, BCL6, 
and  MUM1  that  correlates  closely  with  gene  expression  profiles 
and  can  differentiate  the  majority  of  GCB  from  non-GCB-like 
DLBCL. These profiles have prognostic importance but, to date, do 
not alter treatment recommendations for the primary treatment of 
DLBCL. Current clinical trials do stratify by DLBCL subtype, and it 
appears that agents like the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor 
ibrutinib and lenalidomide are most active in non-GCB DLBCL in 
the relapsed setting. Treatment may then be differentiated by these 
subtypes in the future.

CLINICAL FEATURES, TREATMENT, AND 
PROGNOSIS OF SPECIFIC NHL
 ■ MATURE B-CELL NEOPLASMS
B-cell NHLs can be characterized into two broad groups—those that 
behave  aggressively,  require  immediate  or  urgent  treatment  with 
combination chemotherapy regimens, and are potentially curable; and 
those  that  are  more  indolent  in  nature,  can  be  observed  and  treated 
only  when  they  cause  symptoms  or  signs  of  organ  function  impair-
ment,  are  very  responsive  to  therapy,  but  are  not  ultimately  curable 
in the vast majority of cases. Among the aggressive diseases, the most 
common are NHL and DLBCL, and the most rapidly prolific are NHL 
and BL. FL is the second most common NHL and the most common 
indolent  NHL.  Other  indolent  NHLs  include  MZL,  lymphoplasma-
cytic  lymphoma  (LPL),  and  hairy  cell  leukemia  (HCL).  MCL  is  an  
intermediate-grade lymphoma that shares some characteristics with the 
aggressive lymphomas (fairly urgent need for treatment and aggressive 
upfront  combination  chemotherapy  regimens),  but  like  the  indolent 
lymphomas, it is not readily curable with conventional-dose therapies.

Burkitt’s Lymphoma  Burkitt’s lymphoma/leukemia (BL) is a rare 
disease in adults in the United States, making up <1% of NHL, but it 
makes  up  ∼30%  of  childhood  NHL.  It  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing 
neoplasms,  with  a  doubling  time  of  <24  h.  In  general,  it  is  a  pediat-
ric  tumor  that  has  three  major  clinical  presentations.  The  endemic 
(African) form presents as a jaw or facial bone tumor that spreads to 
extranodal  sites  including  ovary,  testis,  kidney,  breast,  and  especially 
the bone marrow and meninges. The nonendemic form has an abdom-
inal presentation with massive disease, ascites, and renal, testis, and/or 
ovarian  involvement  and,  like  the  endemic  form,  also  spreads  to  the 
bone  marrow  and  CNS.  Immunodeficiency-related  cases  more  often 
involve lymph nodes and may present as acute leukemia. BL has a male 
predominance and is typically seen in patients <35 years of age.

On biopsy, there is a monotonous infiltration of medium-sized cells 
with  round  nuclei,  multiple  nucleoli,  and  basophilic  cytoplasm  with 
vacuoles.  The  proliferation  rate  is  ∼100%,  and  tingible  body  macro-
phages  give  rise  to  the  classic  “starry  sky”  appearance  of  this  tumor 
(Fig.  108-4).  Tumor  cells  are  positive  for  B-cell  antigens  CD19  and 
CD20 and surface immunoglobulin. They are also uniformly positive 
for  CD10  and  BCL6  but  negative  for  BCL2.  Endemic  BLs  are  EBV 
positive,  whereas  the  majority  of  nonendemic  BLs  are  EBV  negative. 
BL is associated with a translocation involving MYC on chromosome 
8q24 in >95% of the cases. The most common partners are chromo-
somes 14, 2, or 22, rearrangements that produce fusions of MYC with 
either the IgH (80%), kappa (15%), or lambda (5%) light chain genes, 
respectively.

While  exquisitely  chemosensitive,  it  is  imperative  that  treatment 
for  BL  be  initiated  quickly  given  the  rapid  doubling  time  and  high 
morbidity of this disease. There are several effective intensive combi-
nation  chemotherapy  regimens,  all  of  which  incorporate  high  doses 
of cyclophosphamide. Prophylactic therapy to the CNS is mandatory. 
Cure can be expected in 80–90% of patients when treated promptly and 
correctly.  Dose-adjusted  EPOCH-R  (rituximab,  infusional  etoposide/
vincristine/doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  prednisone)  is  highly 
effective.  Salvage  therapy  has  been  generally  ineffective  in  patients 
whose  disease  progresses  after  upfront  therapy,  emphasizing  the 

FIGURE 108-4  Burkitt’s lymphoma. The neoplastic cells are homogeneous, medium-
sized B cells with frequent mitotic figures, a morphologic correlate of high growth 
fraction.  Reactive  macrophages  are  scattered  through  the  tumor,  and  their  pale 
cytoplasm in a background of blue-staining tumor cells gives the tumor a so-called 
starry sky appearance.

importance of the initial treatment approach and referral to a tertiary 
cancer center with experience treating this disease.

Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma  DLBCL is the most common 
histologic subtype of NHL diagnosed, representing about one-third of 
all cases. Previously felt to be “one disease,” it is now recognized as a 
heterogeneous collection of multiple entities. It is slightly more com-
mon  in  Caucasians  and  men,  and  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  is  64. 
The relative risk (RR) of DLBCL is higher among people with affected 
first-degree  relatives  (RR  3.5-fold),  and  patients  with  congenital  or 
acquired  immunodeficiency,  patients  on  immunosuppression,  and 
patients with autoimmune disorders also have a higher risk of develop-
ing DLBCL, often EBV-related. The majority of patients present with 
advanced-stage  disease,  with  only  30–40%  of  patients  having  stage  I 
or  II  disease;  ∼40%  of  patients  will  have  “B”  symptoms,  and  50%  of 
patients  will  have  an  elevated  LDH.  Up  to  40%  of  patients  will  have 
involvement  of  non–lymph  node  sites  including  bone  marrow,  CNS, 
gastrointestinal  tract,  thyroid,  liver,  and  skin.  Patients  with  extensive 
bone marrow involvement or involvement of the testes, breast, kidney, 
adrenal gland, paranasal sinus, or epidural space are at increased risk 
of CNS dissemination.

The tumor consists of a diffuse proliferation of large, atypical lym-
phocytes with a high proliferative index (Fig. 108-5). These cells typi-
cally express the B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, and CD79a. Expression 
of CD10 and BCL6 is consistent with the tumor cell being of germinal 
center origin (GCB), while the expression of MUM1 corresponds with 

FIGURE 108-5  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The neoplastic cells are heterogeneous 
but predominantly large cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.

the  non–germinal  center  or  activated  B  cell  (ABC)  subtype.  BCL2 
is  overexpressed  in  anywhere  from  25  to  80%  of  DLBCLs,  whereas 
BCL6 is positive in more than two-thirds of cases, either as the result 
of translocations, gain of copy number, or promoter mutations. MYC 
is  rearranged  in  10%  of  DLBCLs,  and  ∼20%  of  MYC-rearranged 
cases have concurrent BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements, a combination 
referred to as “double-hit lymphoma.” These double-hit lymphomas are 
associated with an extremely poor prognosis with a median OS of only 
12–18 months. Amplification and/or overexpression of MYC indepen-
dent of rearrangements or amplification have also been described and 
are also associated with a poor, albeit better, prognosis.

Combination  chemotherapy  offers  potentially  curative  therapy  for 
DLBCL,  regardless  of  the  stage.  The  addition  of  the  anti-CD20  anti-
body  rituximab  to  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  and 
prednisone (R-CHOP) improved survival beyond CHOP alone and is 
the standard first-line chemotherapy for this disease. For patients with 
early-stage  disease  localized  to  a  radiation  field,  treatment  options 
include full-course chemotherapy with R-CHOP every 3 weeks for six 
cycles  or  abbreviated  chemotherapy  for  three  to  four  cycles  followed 
by involved field radiotherapy. For advanced-stage DLBCL, therapy is 
with a full course of chemotherapy. On average, ∼60–65% of patients 
with DLBCL can be expected to be cured with this approach, and the 
likelihood of cure is predicted by the IPI, gene expression profile cell of 
origin, and/or MYC cytogenetics and expression. Several studies have 
investigated  alternative  anthracycline-containing  chemotherapy  regi-
mens and/or consolidation autologous stem cell transplantation in first 
remission for higher-risk disease without improvement over R-CHOP 
alone.  Dose-adjusted  R-EPOCH  is  one  such  regimen.  Although  this 
regimen did not appear to be better than R-CHOP for DLBCL in one 
multicenter clinical trial, it is often used to treat primary mediastinal 
large B-cell lymphoma and double-hit DLBCL based on results from 
phase 2 and retrospective studies, respectively. CNS prophylaxis with 
either  intrathecal  chemotherapy  or  high-dose  systemic  methotrexate 
and leucovorin rescue should be considered for patients with high risk 
of CNS dissemination. This includes patients with primary testicular 
involvement  and  breast  involvement,  as  well  as  patients  with  several 
IPI risk factors and diffuse bone marrow involvement, renal involve-
ment, or adrenal involvement. The use of CNS prophylaxis for disease 
involving the paranasal sinuses or the epidural space is less clear but 
may be considered.

Over  one-third  of  patients  will  either  have  primary  refractory 
disease  or  disease  that  relapses  after  first-line  chemotherapy.  These 
patients  may  still  be  cured  with  salvage  chemotherapy  regimens  fol-
lowed by autologous stem cell transplantation. However, patients with 
a  poor  performance  status  or  advanced  age  who  are  not  candidates 
for  such  an  approach  are  often  managed  with  palliative  intentions. 
Radiation to symptomatic areas of disease can be transiently helpful. 
Less intensive chemotherapy with drugs like gemcitabine, cytarabine, 
or bendamustine can help control disease and symptoms for a limited 
period  of  time.  These  patients  should  be  referred  for  clinical  trials 
when applicable. For patients in whom more aggressive therapy is an 
option,  treatment  is  with  combination  chemotherapy  using  various 
combinations  of  drugs  primarily  in  order  to  identify  patients  with 
chemosensitive disease. Patients with chemosensitive disease have the 
greatest  likelihood  of  benefiting  from  high-dose  chemotherapy  and 
autologous  stem  cell  transplant,  which  improves  response  duration 
and survival over salvage chemotherapy alone and leads to long-term 
disease-free  survival  in  ∼40–50%  of  patients.  For  patients  with  che-
morefractory disease, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) 
offer a potentially curative option. For this therapy, T cells are collected 
from a patient and are then genetically modified to express a receptor 
that will bind to a surface antigen expressed on the patient’s own tumor 
cells. In the case of B cell malignancies, CD19 has been targeted most 
commonly.  After  infusion,  autologous  CAR-T  cells  home  to  sites  of 
disease  and  also  persist  over  time.  The  CARs  consist  of  an  extracel-
lular antigen recognition domain (typically a single chain Fv variable 
fragment  from  a  monoclonal  antibody)  linked  via  a  transmembrane 
domain to an intracellular signaling domain (usually the CD3ζ endo-
domain), resulting in the redirection of T cell specificity toward target 

antigen-positive cells, and one or more costimulatory domains includ-
ing CD28, 4-1BB, or OX40 to enhance cytokine secretion and effector 
cell expansion and prevent activation-induced apoptosis and immune 
suppression  by  tumor-related  metabolites.  Anti-CD19  CAR-T  cells 
have  been  approved  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed/refractory  DLBCL 
following  two  prior  systemic  therapies.  This  would  include  patients 
with  chemotherapy-insensitive  disease  following  second-line  salvage 
chemotherapy  for  whom  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  is  not  an 
option  or  patients  who  relapse  after  autologous  stem  cell  transplant. 
In this setting, the response rate of CAR-T cells is >80%, with >50% 
of patients achieving a complete response. These responses appear to 
be durable, with 40% of patients in remission at long-term follow-up.

Targeting  CD19  with  the  monoclonal  antibody  tafasitamab  in 
combination  with  lenalidomide  also  yielded  high  response  rates  and 
prolonged response durability, leading to approval of this regimen in 
relapsed disease. Reports of ongoing studies exploring bispecific anti-
bodies that target CD20 on malignant B cells while also binding CD3 
on  T  cells,  thereby  activating  T  cells  to  attack  the  malignant  B  cell, 
have been very promising in both aggressive and indolent B-cell NHL. 
The  antibody-drug  conjugate  polatuzumab  vedotin,  which  combines 
an  anti-CD79b  antibody  with  the  microtubule  toxin  monomethyl 
aurostatin  E  (MMAE),  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  relapsed/
refractory DLBCL in combination with bendamustine and rituximab 
based on the results of a randomized clinical trial against bendamus-
tine and rituximab alone. The oral drug selinexor, a selective inhibitor 
of nuclear export, has modest activity in relapsed DLBCL as a single 
agent  and  is  approved  for  this  indication.  These  drugs,  along  with 
drugs such as lenalidomide alone or ibrutinib, should be viewed as a 
bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplant for eligible patients in whom 
curative therapy is the goal because they are unlikely to lead to durable 
or permanent remissions.

Other  large  B-cell  lymphomas  include  intravascular  large  B-cell 
lymphoma,  T-cell/histiocyte–rich  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  EBV- 
positive  DLBCL  of  the  elderly,  and  ALK-positive  large  B-cell  lym-
phoma.  Patients  with  the  latter  two  diseases  tend  to  have  a  poor 
prognosis, whereas the addition of rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy 
has  dramatically  improved  outcomes  with  intravascular  large  B-cell 
lymphoma,  and  the  outcomes  in  T-cell/histiocyte–rich  large  B-cell 
lymphoma are similar to DLBCL. R-CHOP remains the treatment of 
choice for each of these lymphomas.

Follicular Lymphoma  FLs are the second leading NHL diagnosis 
in the United States and Europe and make up 22% of NHLs worldwide 
and at least 30% of NHLs diagnosed in the United States. This type of 
lymphoma can be diagnosed accurately on morphologic findings alone 
and has been the diagnosis in the majority of patients in therapeutic 
trials for “low-grade” lymphoma in the past.

Evaluation of an adequate biopsy by an expert hematopathologist is 
sufficient to make a diagnosis of FL. The tumor is composed of small 
cleaved and large cells in varying proportions organized in a follicular 
pattern of growth (Fig. 108-6). Confirmation of B-cell immunopheno-
type  (monoclonal  immunoglobulin  light  chain,  CD19,  CD20,  CD10, 
and  BCL6  positive,  and  CD5  and  CD23  negative)  and  the  existence 
of  the  t(14;18)  and  abnormal  expression  of  BCL2  protein  are  confir-
matory. While >85% of FLs will harbor a t(14;18) and overexpress the 
antiapoptotic protein BCL2, this genetic event is necessary but not suf-
ficient for malignant transformation of the B lymphocytes, and multi-
ple genetic events are required for the development of FL. Studies have 
identified the most common recurrent genetic events in FL, and they 
included  mutations  in  several  epigenetic  modifying  genes,  including 
MLL2, EZH2, CREBBP, and EP300. The major differential diagnosis is 
between lymphoma and reactive follicular hyperplasia. The coexistence 
of DLBCL must be considered. Patients with FL are often subclassified, 
or  graded,  into  those  with  predominantly  small  cells,  those  with  a 
mixture of small and large cells, and those with predominantly large 
cells. The WHO classification adopted grading from I to III based on 
the  number  of  centroblasts,  or  large  cells,  counted  per  high-power 
field (hpf): grade I, from 0 to 5 centroblasts/hpf; grade II, from 6 to 15  
centroblasts/hpf;  and  grade  III,  >15  centroblasts/hpf.  Grade  III  has

duration  of  >2  years.  This  response  duration  is  improved  with  the 
addition  of  maintenance  rituximab  following  a  favorable  response 
to  rituximab  induction  therapy.  For  patients  with  a  larger  volume  of 
disease at the time of treatment initiation, the addition of rituximab to 
chemotherapy regimens such as CHOP or cyclophosphamide, vincris-
tine, and prednisone (CVP) has improved survival in this disease. The 
combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR) has been compared 
to R-CHOP and results in longer response duration and less toxicity. 
Thus, BR has become the standard of care for the first-line therapy of 
medium-  to  high-volume  FL.  Similarly,  the  addition  of  maintenance 
rituximab following a good response to R-CHOP or R-CVP improves 
response  duration  when  used  in  newly  treated  FL  patients.  A  newer 
anti-CD20  antibody,  obinutuzumab,  has  been  tested  in  combination 
with  chemotherapy  in  a  randomized  trial  against  rituximab  plus 
chemotherapy in previously untreated FL. The obinutuzumab combi-
nations resulted in improvements in minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negativity as well as progression-free survival at the expense of more 
infection and infusion reactions. Based on these results, both rituximab 
plus chemotherapy and obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy are options 
for untreated FL in need of treatment. The superiority of one over the 
other has not been established.

In  patients  with  FL,  the  disease  nearly  always  recurs  following 
therapy,  after  which  retreatment  is  again  reserved  for  symptomatic 
disease or disease interfering with organ function. Single-agent ritux-
imab or alternative chemotherapy regimens, with both rituximab and 
obinutuzumab, can again be employed. Both autologous and allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantations yield high complete response 
rates  in  patients  with  relapsed  FL,  and  long-term  remissions  can 
occur in 40 and 60% of patients, respectively. The latter is associated 
with  considerable  treatment-related  morbidity  and  mortality  and  so 
is  usually  reserved  for  patients  with  multiply  relapsed  FL  that  is  no 
longer responsive to chemotherapy. More targeted oral therapies like 
lenalidomide  and  the  PI3  kinase  inhibitors  idelalisib,  duvelisib,  and 
copanlisib are active in both untreated and relapsed FL. Inhibitors of 
one of the most commonly mutated genes in FL, EZH2, have activity in 
both EZH2 mutated as well as unmutated lymphomas, and one, taze-
metostat, is approved for this indication. Anti-CD19–directed CAR-T 
cell therapies are also being tested in FL, with complete responses seen 
in >80% of patients with multiply relapsed disease, and with many of 
those responses proving durable, albeit with limited follow-up. Longer 
follow-up is needed to determine if this may be a definitive treatment 
strategy for a subset of relapsed FL patients. On average, most patients 
will live with FL for 15–20 years, a number that is increasing given our 
improved understanding of the genetics and microenvironment of FL 
and the increasing number of drugs and therapies being tested in this 
disease. However, in addition to a high-risk FLIPI, patients who do not 
have a complete metabolic response by PET/CT scanning to their pri-
mary therapy and patients who relapse within 2 years of the completion 
of their primary chemotherapy tend to do poorly with chemotherapy.

Patients  with  FL  have  a  high  rate  of  histologic  transformation  to 
DLBCL  (∼3%  per  year).  This  is  recognized  ∼40%  of  the  time  during 
the  course  of  the  illness  by  repeat  biopsy  and  is  present  in  almost 
all  patients  at  autopsy.  This  transformation  is  usually  heralded  by 
rapid  growth  of  lymph  nodes—often  localized—and  the  develop-
ment  of  systemic  symptoms  such  as  fevers,  sweats,  and  weight  loss. 
When  this  happens  in  patients  who  have  had  previously  untreated 
FL,  treatment  with  R-CHOP  chemotherapy,  as  for  DLBCL,  can  be 
curative  for  the  aggressive  component  while  the  FL  may  eventu-
ally  recur.  In  patients  with  previously  treated  FL  that  transforms  to 
DLBCL, prognosis is poor, and successful therapy with an aggressive 
combination  chemotherapy  regimen  should  be  consolidated  with  an 
autologous stem cell transplant. Finally, as discussed previously, grade 
IIIb FL is more similar to DLBCL than it is to FL and should be treated  
as such.

Marginal Zone Lymphoma  The second most common indolent 
B-cell NHL is MZL. There are three main types: splenic MZL, extran-
odal MZL of MALT, and nodal MZL.

FIGURE  108-6  Follicular  lymphoma.  The  normal  nodal  architecture  is  effaced  by 
nodular expansions of tumor cells. Nodules vary in size and contain predominantly 
small lymphocytes with cleaved nuclei along with variable numbers of larger cells 
with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.

been  subdivided  into  grade  IIIa,  in  which  centrocytes  predominate, 
and  grade  IIIb,  in  which  there  are  sheets  of  centroblasts.  While  this 
distinction cannot be made simply or very reproducibly, these subdivi-
sions do have prognostic significance. Patients with FL with predom-
inantly  large  cells  have  a  higher  proliferative  fraction,  progress  more 
rapidly,  and  have  a  shorter  OS  with  simple  chemotherapy  regimens. 
Grade IIIb FL is an aggressive disease and considered most similar to 
DLBCL and treated as such with curative intent.

The most common presentation for FL is with new, painless lymph-
adenopathy.  Multiple  sites  of  lymphoid  involvement  are  typical,  and 
unusual sites such as epitrochlear nodes are sometimes seen. However, 
essentially  any  organ  can  be  involved,  and  extranodal  presentations 
do occur. Most patients do not have an elevated LDH or fevers, night 
sweats,  or  weight  loss,  although  histologic  transformation  to  DLBCL 
does occur at a rate of ∼3% per year and can be associated with these 
signs or symptoms. As discussed previously, prognosis is best predicted 
by  the  FLIPI.  Staging  is  typically  done  with  CT  scans  of  the  chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis, as well as the neck if neck disease is suspected, 
although  PET/CT  scans  can  be  helpful  in  cases  where  disease  trans-
formation is suspected, as transformed disease will be more FDG avid 
than indolent disease, or for confirmation of early-stage disease, where 
definitive local therapy with radiation may be considered.

Although FL is highly sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, 
these therapies are usually not ultimately curative, except in the setting 
of early-stage disease. If the disease can be encompassed in a radiation 
field, involved field radiotherapy at a dose of 24–30 Gy may be curative, 
with 5-, 10-, and 15-year freedom from treatment failure rates of 72, 
46, and 39%, and overall 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates of 93, 75, 
and 62%, respectively. If radiation therapy would not be tolerated or if 
a patient prefers not to receive radiation, observation is a reasonable 
alternative with a median time to treatment not reached at 7 years of 
follow-up in one study. Many of these patients are diagnosed inciden-
tally  or  at  a  time  when  their  lymphoma  is  not  causing  symptoms  or 
signs  of  organ  function  impairment.  Numerous  studies  have  shown 
that  treating  patients  with  asymptomatic  disease  does  not  improve 
survival compared with a program of close observation, with treatment 
reserved  for  symptomatic  disease  progression  or  organ  dysfunction. 
Thus, asymptomatic patients should be observed.

When  treatment  is  indicated,  there  are  a  variety  of  treatment 
options, including the use of the monoclonal antibody against CD20, 
rituximab,  alone  or  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  Treatment 
decisions are often determined by the indication for treatment and/or 
by the volume of disease being treated. For patients requiring therapy 
for inflammatory or autoimmune phenomenon thought to be driven 
by FL, or for patients with low-volume disease, single-agent rituximab 
is  associated  with  a  response  rate  of  ∼70%  and  a  median  response

Nodal MZL most closely resembles FL clinically, and much of the 
way  we  manage  and  treat  it  is  based  on  studies  done  in  FL.  Tumor 
biopsies in this disease show parafollicular and perivascular infiltration 
by  monocytoid-appearing  atypical  lymphocytes  with  folded  nuclear 
contours that are positive for CD19, CD20, and CD79a but negative for 
CD10 and largely negative for CD5. Some cases can have plasmacytoid 
differentiation and can be associated with a monoclonal expression of 
kappa or lambda light chains and with small monoclonal immunoglob-
ulin spikes. Treatment is often similar to that of FL, with the exception 
that the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib is highly active in this disease, while 
largely disappointing in FL, and is a good treatment option for relapsed 
nodal MZL as well as other MZL subtypes.

Splenic MZL is largely a disease of older Caucasian patients; infec-
tion with hepatitis C is a risk factor for this disease, and treatment of 
hepatitis C can result in regression of the lymphoma. Patients present 
with  a  lymphocytosis  with  or  without  cytopenias  and  splenomegaly. 
Bone  marrow  involvement  is  common.  Diagnosis  can  be  made  by 
flow  cytometry  of  the  peripheral  blood;  malignant  lymphocytes  will 
be  positive  for  surface  immunoglobulin,  CD19,  and  CD20  and  will 
generally lack CD5 and CD10. On peripheral smear, they have small 
nuclei and abundant cytoplasm with “shaggy” or villous projections. It 
can be differentiated from HCL by the absence of CD25, CD103, and 
annexin  A1.  Recurrent  cytogenetic  abnormalities  include  trisomy  3 
and abnormalities of chromosome 7q. Therapy is indicated for symp-
tomatic  disease  or  significant  cytopenias.  Splenectomy  is  reasonable 
for selected patients with excellent relief of symptoms and cytopenias. 
Splenectomy  is  associated  with  an  overall  response  rate  of  85%  and 
estimated progression-free survival and OS rates at 5 years of 58 and 
77%,  respectively.  Single-agent  rituximab  can  improve  splenomegaly 
and cytopenias in >90% of patients. In a study of induction with weekly 
rituximab followed by maintenance, the response rate was 95%, with 
overall  and  progression-free  survival  rates  at  5  years  of  92  and  73%, 
respectively. Other options for therapy at relapse are similar to those 
used for FL and include retreatment with rituximab, alkylating agents, 
and purine analogues in combination with rituximab. The survival rate 
of patients is in excess of 70% at 10 years.

MALT lymphoma is an MZL lymphoma of extranodal tissue, most 
commonly the stomach, but other common sites include the skin, sali-
vary glands, lung, small bowel, ocular adnexa, breasts, bladder, thyroid, 
dura, and synovium. It is associated with states of chronic inflamma-
tion  due  to  either  autoimmune  diseases  like  Sjögren’s  syndrome  or 
Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis  or  chronic  infections  with  organisms  like  H. 
pylori  (gastric),  Borrelia  burgdorferi  (skin),  C.  psittaci  (conjunctiva), 
C.  jejuni  (intestines),  and  hepatitis  C  virus.  The  essential  pathologic 
feature  of  MALT  lymphoma  is  the  presence  of  lymphoepithelial 
lesions,  which  result  from  invasion  of  mucosal  glands  and  crypts  by 
the neoplastic lymphocytes. These cells are positive for CD19, CD20, 
and  CD79a  and  negative  for  CD5  and  CD10.  Recurrent  cytogenetic 
abnormalities  include  t(11;18),  t(14;18),  t(1;14),  t(3;14),  and  trisomy 
8.  The  t(11;18)  is  most  common,  occurring  in  up  to  50%  of  MALT 
lymphomas. It results in the fusion of the apoptosis inhibitor 2 (API2) 
gene and the MALT1 gene, resulting in activation of nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB).  Unlike  other  indolent  B-cell  lymphomas,  MALT  lympho-
mas present most commonly with stage I or II disease. In these cases, 
radiation therapy may be curative. Alternatively, patients may respond 
to  antibiotics  for  the  associated  underlying  infection.  Treatment  of 
symptomatic  or  organ-impairing  relapsed,  refractory,  or  advanced-
stage disease is similar to approaches used in FL with chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy.

Lymphoplasmacytic  Lymphoma  About  1%  of  all  NHLs  will 
be  LPLs,  which  are  indolent  B-cell  NHLs  with  lymphoplasmacytic 
differentiation,  most  commonly  associated  with  a  monoclonal  IgM 
paraprotein. Nearly all patients will have stage IV disease at diagnosis 
with bone marrow involvement. Patients with high levels of circulating 
IgM paraproteins constitute a specific entity known as Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia and can have symptoms due to hyperviscosity as 
a  result  of  the  circulating  IgM.  Activating  mutations  in  MYD88,  an 

adaptor  protein  that  is  involved  in  signaling  downstream  of  the  Ig 
receptor  leading  to  NF-κB  activation,  are  present  in  >90%  of  cases. 
Tumor biopsies are notable for proliferation of small lymphocytes, lym-
phoplasmacytic cells, and plasma cells, and malignant lymphocytes are 
positive for CD19, CD20, and surface IgM but generally negative for 
CD5 and CD10. Like the other indolent NHLs, treatment is indicated 
for  disease  that  causes  symptoms  or  interferes  with  organ  function; 
hyperviscosity related to elevated serum IgM and paraneoplastic neu-
ropathy are additional indications for therapy. Single-agent rituximab 
may  be  useful  for  low-volume  disease  but  can  be  associated  with  a 
transient rise in serum IgM concentrations that can cause or exacer-
bate hyperviscosity. Chemoimmunotherapy with regimens such as BR 
and rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone is active, as are 
myeloma therapies such as bortezomib. Ibrutinib in combination with 
rituximab is highly active in this disease and is an option for both pre-
viously untreated and relapsed disease. Given that 85% of IgM remains 
intravascular, acute relief of hyperviscosity symptoms can be obtained 
by  plasmapheresis.  For  recurrent  disease,  one  can  often  use  agents 
that were previously used. For patients with more refractory LPL, the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the 
oral  BTK  ibrutinib  are  active.  Selected  patients  with  relapsed  disease 
are  considered  for  high-dose  therapy  with  autologous  or  allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation. The results seen are similar to those of other 
indolent lymphomas.

Mantle Cell Lymphoma  MCL  composes  ∼6%  of  NHLs.  It  is  an 
intermediate-grade  lymphoma  that,  like  the  indolent  B-cell  NHLs, 
is  not  curable  with  conventional  therapies  but,  like  the  aggressive 
lymphomas,  often  requires  more  aggressive  chemoimmunotherapy 
regimens with or without an autologous stem cell transplant to achieve 
a reasonable response duration. This therapy is not curative, however, 
and median survival with this disease is on the order of 5–10 years. An 
exception to this is a more indolent SOX11 variant that often presents 
with  circulating  disease  with  splenomegaly  but  without  significant 
lymphadenopathy  and  with  a  low  Ki67  (<10%).  This  subset  behaves 
more  like  the  indolent  B-cell  NHLs  and  can  be  observed  until  treat-
ment is indicated by symptoms or organ function impairment. Simi-
larly, there is a blastic variant with a high Ki67 index that is associated 
with a poor prognosis and a median OS of only 18 months. For other 
patients, prognosis is best predicted by the biologic MCL International 
Prognostic  Index  (MIPI),  which  factors  in  age,  performance  status, 
LDH, white blood cell count, and Ki67 expression to determine a risk 
group. This disease is more common in men, and the average age of 
diagnosis is 63. MCLs with a mutation in TP53 or a complex karyo-
type are particularly high risk as well. Over two-thirds of patients will 
have stage IV disease, mostly with bone marrow and peripheral blood 
involvement, at the time of diagnosis. Another common extranodal site 
of involvement is the gastrointestinal tract, where diffuse lymphoma-
tous polyposis may be seen.

The pathognomonic cytogenetic finding in MCL is t(11;14), which 
brings the gene for the cell cycle control protein cyclin D1 under the 
control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene promoter on chromo-
some 14. This translocation is present in >90% of cases. The remaining 
cases usually overexpress cyclin D2, cyclin D3, or cyclin E. Tumor cells 
also are positive for B cell markers CD19 and CD20, as well as CD5. 
They usually lack CD10 and CD23.

Therapies  for  MCL  are  evolving.  Patients  with  localized  dis-
ease  might  be  treated  with  combination  chemotherapy  followed  by 
radiotherapy;  however,  these  patients  are  exceedingly  rare.  Similarly, 
patients with the indolent variant can be observed until disease pro-
gresses to cause symptoms or signs of organ function impairment. For 
the usual presentation with disseminated disease, standard lymphoma 
treatments like R-CHOP have been unsatisfactory, with the minority 
of  patients  achieving  complete  remission.  The  addition  of  high-dose 
cytarabine to an R-CHOP–like backbone with or without consolidation 
autologous  stem  cell  transplantation  in  first  remission  has  improved 
progression-free survival, but it has not elicited cures in this disease. 
These  include  the  Nordic  regimens  and  R-HyperCVAD  (rituximab,

cyclophosphamide,  vincristine,  doxorubicin,  dexamethasone,  cytara-
bine,  and  methotrexate).  BR  has  activity  in  this  disease  and  is  more 
effective and better tolerated than R-CHOP. Newer studies with short 
follow-up  suggest  that  strategies  that  combine  BR  with  cytarabine 
with or without autologous stem cell transplant may be effective and 
well  tolerated.  Maintenance  rituximab,  following  a  good  response  to 
induction chemotherapy or after autologous stem cell transplant, also 
improves  outcomes  over  observation  alone.  For  relapsed  disease,  the 
BTK  inhibitors  ibrutinib  and  acalabrutinib  have  single-agent  activity 
with a response rate of almost 70% but a response duration of only 18 
months. These drugs are being explored in combination with chemo-
therapy as well as with the BCL2 antagonist venetoclax. Anti-CD19–
directed  CAR-T  cell  therapies  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of 
relapsed/refractory  MCL;  two-thirds  of  patients  who  had  progressed 
after chemoimmunotherapy (with or without an autologous stem cell 
transplant)  and  BTK  inhibition  have  achieved  complete  responses, 
many of which are durable through limited follow-up. As in FL, longer 
follow-up  is  needed  to  determine  if  some  of  these  patients  may  be 
cured, which would make this the only curative therapy for this dis-
ease outside of an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Drugs such as 
lenalidomide, venetoclax, bortezomib, and temsirolimus can similarly 
induce transient partial responses. Appropriate patients who respond 
to salvage therapy, with the exception of CAR-T cell therapy, should be 
considered for allogeneic stem cell transplant, which can lead to long-
term disease-free survival in 30–50% of patients.

 ■ MATURE (PERIPHERAL) T CELL DISORDERS
Mature T cell disorders include cutaneous lymphomas, such as mycosis 
fungoides, and the PTCLs, some of which are distinguished based on 
specific clinical presentations or contexts or by molecular or biologic 
features, but many of which fall into the category of PTCL not other-
wise  specified  (NOS).  T-cell  NHLs  are  significantly  rarer  than  B-cell 
NHLs, and as such, our understanding of their biology is less advanced 
and our therapies are less well developed. While some T-cell lympho-
mas,  like  mycosis  fungoides,  can  behave  indolently  and  some,  like 
ALK-positive ALCL, can be cured with chemotherapy, the majority are 
associated with a poor prognosis. The advent of genomic technologies 
is enhancing our ability to understand the genetic and biologic basis of 
these neoplasms.

Mycosis Fungoides  Mycosis fungoides is also known as cutaneous 
T-cell lymphoma. This lymphoma is more often seen by dermatologists 
than internists. The median age of onset is in the mid-fifties, and the 
disease is more common in males and in blacks.

Mycosis  fungoides  is  an  indolent  lymphoma,  with  patients  often 
having  several  years  of  eczematous  or  dermatitic  skin  lesions  before 
the  diagnosis  is  finally  established.  The  skin  lesions  progress  from 
patch stage to plaque stage to cutaneous tumors. Early in the disease, 
biopsies  are  often  difficult  to  interpret,  and  the  diagnosis  may  only 
become apparent by observing the patient over time. Adenopathy may 
reflect involvement with mycosis fungoides or be read as dermatopathic 
change. In advanced stages, the lymphoma can spread to lymph nodes 
and visceral organs. Patients with this lymphoma may develop general-
ized erythroderma and circulating tumor cells, called Sézary’s syndrome.
Rare  patients  with  localized  early-stage  mycosis  fungoides  can  be 
cured  with  radiotherapy,  often  total-skin  electron  beam  irradiation. 
More  advanced  disease  has  been  treated  with  topical  glucocorticoids, 
topical  nitrogen  mustard,  phototherapy,  psoralen  with  ultraviolet  A 
(PUVA), extracorporeal photopheresis, retinoids (bexarotene), electron 
beam radiation, interferon, antibodies, fusion toxins, histone deacety-
lase  inhibitors,  brentuximab  (for  CD30+  disease),  and  systemic  cyto-
toxic therapy. Mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 antibody, has activity in 
this disease and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration for this indication. Unfortunately, these treatments are palliative.

Peripheral  T-Cell  Lymphoma,  Not  Otherwise  Specified  
PTCLs  include  a  number  of  entities,  which  constitute  15%  of  all 
NHLs in adults. PTCL NOS, which composes 6% of all NHLs, is the 

term  used  for  cases  that  are  not  other  entities  defined  in  the  WHO 
classification.  Named  varieties  include  ALCL,  angioimmunoblastic  
T-cell lymphoma (AITL), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, enteropathy- 
associated T-cell lymphoma, and subcutaneous panniculitis T-cell lym-
phoma. PTCL NOS is a disease of older individuals, with a median age 
at presentation of 65, and the majority of patients will have advanced-
stage disease at diagnosis, with involvement of the bone marrow, liver, 
spleen, and skin being common. Associated “B” symptoms and pruritis 
are also common. These lymphomas can be associated with a reactive 
eosinophilia  as  well  as  hemophagocytic  syndrome.  The  IPI  has  been 
applied to PTCL NOS and provides some assessment of outcomes, but 
even the low-risk group has a median OS of just >2 years.

This  diagnostic  category  is  a  collection  of  heterogeneous  lympho-
mas that vary widely and lack typical findings of other specific PTCL 
subgroups.  Because  of  this  heterogeneity,  histology,  immunophe-
notype,  and  genetics  are  variable.  Often  lymph  nodes  are  effaced  by 
atypical  lymphoid  cells  of  various  sizes,  sometimes  associated  with 
vascular  proliferation  or  an  infiltrate  of  eosinophils  and/or  macro-
phages. As most of these lymphomas behave aggressively, note is often 
made of mitotic and apoptotic figures as well as geographic necrosis. 
The cells often are positive for CD3, and the majority of PTCL NOS 
is positive for CD4 rather than CD8, but some are negative for both 
markers.  There  can  be  loss  of  more  mature  T-cell  markers  like  CD5 
and CD7, and this is associated with a more aggressive course. There 
are some recurrent translocations, including t(7;14), t(11;14), inv(14), 
and t(14;14), all of which involve the TCR genes.

The  most  common  primary  therapy  for  PTCL  NOS  involves  a 
CHOP-like  chemotherapy  backbone—either  CHOP  alone  or  CHOP 
in combination with etoposide (CHOEP). The latter may provide the 
most benefit to younger patients and patients with more favorable dis-
ease risk factors. Brentuximab in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) has been tested in a randomized 
clinical trial against CHOP in CD30+ T-cell lymphomas; progression-
free survival was improved with the brentuximab-containing arm, and 
this was most pronounced for patients with ALCL (see below). Autol-
ogous  stem  cell  transplant  has  been  investigated  for  patients  in  their 
first remission and does seem to improve progression-free survival in 
certain contexts. Drugs such as gemcitabine, bendamustine, and prala-
trexate have activity in relapsed disease, as do the histone deacetylase 
inhibitors romidepsin and belinostat. The PI3 kinase inhibitor duveli-
sib is being investigated in these diseases with early signals of activity. 
All of these agents are associated with transient responses in a minor-
ity  of  patients.  Patients  should  be  considered  for  clinical  trials.  For 
patients who do achieve remission, reduced-intensity allogeneic stem 
cell  transplantation  can  yield  long-term  nonrelapse  survival  rates  of  
∼40–50%.

Angioimmunoblastic  T-Cell  Lymphoma  AITL  constitutes 
∼20% of T-cell NHLs and ∼4% of all NHLs diagnosed. Patients present 
with a variety of signs and symptoms, most often including lymphade-
nopathy,  hepatosplenomegaly,  “B”  symptoms,  rash,  polyarthritis,  and 
hemolytic anemia. Over 80% of patients have advanced-stage disease 
at  diagnosis,  and  bone  marrow  involvement  is  common.  Polyclonal 
hypergammaglobulinemia  is  common,  as  are  elevated  LDH,  eosino-
philia, a positive Coombs test, and opportunistic infections.

On  biopsy,  lymph  nodes  are  effaced  by  a  polymorphous  infiltrate 
of lymphocytes, ranging in size and shape, and of immunoblasts. The 
neoplastic lymphocytes are positive for CD3 as well as CXCL13, PD-1, 
CD10,  and  BCL6,  most  closely  resembling  CD4-positive  follicular 
helper T cells. There is an expanded follicular dendritic cell network 
surrounding tumor cells. Scattered immunoblasts are often EBV pos-
itive  and  may  give  rise  to  secondary  EBV-positive  B-cell  lymphomas 
at a later time. Genetic analysis of this disease has revealed recurrent 
mutations in TET2 (76%), DNMT3 (33%), and IDH2 (20%).

There is a subset of AITL that can remit with immunosuppression 
with agents like glucocorticoids or methotrexate. Most patients, how-
ever,  will  need  combination  chemotherapy  with  regimens  like  those 
used in PTCL NOS. Median response duration is short, and median OS

is only 15–36 months. Treatment of relapsed disease is similar to that 
of relapsed PTCL NOS.

Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma  ALCL is the next most com-
mon  T-cell  lymphoma  after  AITL  but  is  more  common  in  children, 
accounting  for  up  to  10%  of  pediatric  lymphomas.  Approximately 
40–60% of cases harbor t(2;5), which fuses a portion of the nucleolar 
protein  nucleophosmin-1  (NPMI)  gene  to  a  part  of  the  anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, the product of which has constitutive 
tyrosine  kinase  activity.  These  patients  have  a  much  more  favorable 
prognosis compared to ALK-negative ALCL, akin to that of DLBCL. 
There  is  an  additional,  more  indolent  and  favorable  subtype  that 
occurs in the breast tissue of patients with breast implants, and there is 
a cutaneous variant. In general, this is a disease that is more common 
in men. ALK-positive disease is a disease of younger patients, with a 
median age at diagnosis of 34 years, whereas the median age at diagno-
sis of ALK-negative patients is 58. With the exception of the cutaneous 
variant and the variant associated with breast implants, most patients 
present with rapidly growing lymphadenopathy with or without extra-
nodal involvement; “B” symptoms are common.

Most cases of ALCL involve large atypical lymphocytes with horse-
shoe-shaped nuclei with prominent nucleoli (“hallmark” cells). Tumor 
cells tend to be localized within the lymph node sinuses, and almost 
all are positive for CD30 but negative for CD15. A majority will also 
express CD3, CD25, CD43, and CD4. ALK-rearranged ALCL can be 
diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetics for 
t(2;5) or by immunohistochemical staining for ALK.

ALCL  is  generally  treated  with  CHOP,  although  like  PTCL  NOS, 
CHOEP may benefit younger patients, particularly with ALK-positive 
disease. Overall, ALCL has a better prognosis than PTCL, and this is 
particularly true for ALK-positive disease, which has an 8-year OS rate 
of 82%, versus 49% for ALK-negative disease. Relapsed ALK-positive 
ALCL  is  treated  similarly  to  relapsed  DLBCL,  with  salvage  combi-
nation  chemotherapy  to  identify  chemotherapy  sensitivity  followed 
by  autologous  stem  cell  transplant.  For  patients  with  chemotherapy- 
insensitive  disease  or  for  ALK-negative  disease,  the  conjugated 
anti-CD30  antibody  to  MMAE  brentuximab  is  highly  active,  with  a 
response  rate  of  86%  and  a  complete  response  rate  of  57%.  As  men-
tioned earlier, brentuximab in combination with CHP chemotherapy is 
an approved frontline regimen for the treatment of CD30+ T-cell lym-
phomas,  including  ALCL.  The  ALK  inhibitors,  including  crizotinib, 
are active in refractory ALK-positive ALCL with excellent outcomes.

Other PTCL Subtypes  Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, 
hepatosplenic  T-cell  lymphoma,  and  subcutaneous  panniculitis-like  
T-cell lymphoma are other less common PTCL subtypes. Enteropathy- 
type  intestinal  T-cell  lymphoma  is  a  rare  disorder.  Type  I  occurs  in 
patients with a history of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and is associated 
with HLADQA1*0501, DQB1*0201; a gluten-free diet can prevent the 
development  of  this  lymphoma.  Type  II  is  not  associated  with  celiac 
disease  and  may  be  a  separate  disease  entity.  Patients  are  frequently 
cachectic and sometimes present with intestinal perforation. The prog-
nosis is poor, with a median survival of 10 months. Therapy is often 
with  combination  chemotherapy,  including  high-dose  methotrexate, 
and autologous stem cell transplant in first remission.

Hepatosplenic γδ T-cell lymphoma is a systemic illness that presents 
with  sinusoidal  infiltration  of  the  liver,  spleen,  and  bone  marrow  by 
malignant T cells. Tumor masses generally do not occur. The disease is 
associated with systemic symptoms and is often difficult to diagnose. 
Recurrent  genetic  events  include  isochromosome  7q  and  trisomy  8. 
Treatment  outcome  is  poor,  but  regimens  that  include  ifosfamide, 
such  as  ifosfamide,  carboplatin,  and  etoposide  (ICE)  or  ifosfamide, 
etoposide, and cytarabine (IVAC), are associated with better outcomes 
in small series of patients. Responding patients should be considered 
for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Subcutaneous  panniculitis-like  T-cell  lymphoma  is  a  rare  disor-
der  that  is  often  confused  with  panniculitis.  Patients  present  with 
multiple  subcutaneous  nodules,  which  progress  and  can  ulcerate. 

FIGURE 108-7  Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Peripheral blood smear showing 
leukemia cells with typical “flower-shaped” nucleus.

There  is  a  more  indolent  form  that  tends  to  express  α/β  TCRs  and 
can  be  managed  with  immune  suppression,  whereas  lymphomas 
that express γ/δ TCRs are more aggressive and are associated with a 
worse prognosis and coincident hemophagocytic syndrome. This is a 
disease of young men in their fifth and sixth decades of life. Patients 
with aggressive disease are managed with multiagent chemotherapy, 
and responding patients should be considered for allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation.

Adult  T-Cell  Leukemia/Lymphoma  Adult  T-cell  leukemia/
lymphoma (ATLL) is a disease that is most prevalent in Japan and the 
Caribbean basin. It is a neoplasm that is driven by HTLV-1, often con-
tracted through the breast milk of infected mothers. The average age 
at diagnosis is 60, so there is a long latency between viral infection and 
viral transformation, and only 4% of infected patients will develop the 
disease. This suggests that HTLV-1 may not be sufficient to cause the 
malignant  phenotype.  There  are  four  disease  variants:  acute  (60%  of 
patients), lymphomatous (20% of patients), chronic (15% of patients), 
and smoldering (5% of patients); prognosis varies across these groups, 
with  median  survival  times  of  6,  10,  and  24  months,  and  not  yet 
reached, respectively. Presentation depends on the subtype, but most 
commonly, patients present with circulating disease and bone marrow 
involvement,  hypercalcemia,  lytic  bone  lesions,  lymphadenopathy, 
hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions, and opportunistic infections.

The  pathognomonic  finding  is  the  malignant  “flower  cell”  that  is 
positive for CD4 and CD25, as well as CD2, CD3, and CD5 but lacking 
CD7  (Fig. 108-7).  Combination  chemotherapy  is  generally  used,  but 
for patients fortunate enough to respond, response durations are very 
short. Other active agents in this disease include the antiretroviral agent 
zidovudine, interferon α, and arsenic. In any patients who do respond 
to therapy, allogeneic stem cell transplant should be considered.

Extranodal  NK/T-Cell  Lymphoma,  Nasal  Type  Extranodal 
NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is a lymphoma that is associated with 
EBV infection in nearly all cases and more common in Asia and native 
populations  in  Peru.  It  usually  presents  with  a  mass  and  obstructive 
symptoms in the upper aerodigestive tract with occasional extranodal 
sites,  but  over  two-thirds  of  patients  will  have  localized  disease.  It  is 
more  common  in  men,  and  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  is  60.  This 
disease  has  its  own  prognostic  score,  which  takes  into  account  the 
presence or absence of “B” symptoms, disease stage, whether LDH is 
elevated, and whether there is lymph node involvement. EBV viral load 
at diagnosis and at the end of therapy is also predictive.

Treatment for early-stage disease is usually with combined-modal-
ity therapy of chemotherapy (commonly using etoposide, ifosfamide, 
cisplatin,  and  dexamethasone)  and  intensity-modulated  radiation 
therapy (50–55 Gy), and patients with localized disease involving the 
nasal  passages  do  quite  well,  with  3-year  OS  of  ∼85%.  Patients  with

852 more advanced-stage disease do poorly, with disseminated extranodal 
relapse occurring frequently, and the median OS is only 4.3 months. 
The  most  commonly  used  treatment  regimen  is  the  SMILE  regi-
men  (dexamethasone,  methotrexate,  ifosfamide,  l-asparaginase,  and 
etoposide).

109 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Caron A. Jacobson, Dan L. Longo

Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is a malignancy of mature B lymphocytes. 
It represents ~10% of all lymphomas diagnosed each year. The majority 
of HL diagnoses are classical HL (cHL), but there is a second subtype 
of  HL,  nodular  lymphocyte-predominant  HL  (NLPHL).  While  this 
diagnosis  does  resemble  cHL  morphologically  in  certain  respects, 
there  is  some  evidence  that  it  is  more  related  to  the  indolent  B-cell 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHLs) biologically than it is to cHL. The 
majority  of  this  chapter  will  be  specific  to  cHL,  with  a  discussion  of 
NLPHL at the end.

cHL  is  one  of  the  success  stories  of  modern  oncology.  Until  the 
advent  of  extended-field  radiotherapy  in  the  mid-twentieth  century, 
it was a highly fatal disease of young people. Radiation therapy cured 
some  patients  with  early-stage  disease,  and  the  introduction  of  mul-
tiagent chemotherapy in the 1970s resulted in further improved cure 
rates,  both  for  patients  with  early-  and  advanced-stage  disease.  Cure 
rates now are >85%. The new challenge in the treatment of HL is late 
therapy-related toxicity, including a high rate of secondary malignan-
cies  and  cardiovascular  disease.  Current  clinical  trials  are  aimed  at 
minimizing this risk while preserving efficacy.
 ■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY
HL  is  of  B-cell  origin.  The  incidence  of  HL  appears  fairly  stable,  with 
8480  new  cases  diagnosed  in  2020  in  the  United  States.  HL  is  more 
common in whites than in blacks and more common in males than in 
females. A bimodal distribution of age at diagnosis has been observed, 
with  one  peak  incidence  occurring  in  patients  in  their  twenties  and 
the  other  in  those  in  their  eighties.  Some  of  the  late  age  peak  may  be 
attributed to confusion among entities with similar appearance such as 
anaplastic  large-cell  lymphoma  and  T-cell/histiocyte–rich  B-cell  lym-
phoma. There are four distinct subtypes of cHL that are differentiated 
based  on  their  histopathologic  features  (Table  109-1):  nodular  scle-
rosis,  mixed  cellularity,  lymphocyte-rich,  and  lymphocyte-depleted. 
Patients  in  the  younger  age  groups  diagnosed  in  the  United  States 
largely  have  the  nodular  sclerosing  subtype  of  HL.  Elderly  patients, 
patients infected with HIV, and patients in developing countries more 
commonly  have  mixed-cellularity  HL  or  lymphocyte-depleted  HL. 
Together,  nodular  sclerosis  and  mixed-cellularity  types  account  for 
nearly  95%  of  cases.  Infection  by  HIV  is  a  risk  factor  for  developing

HL.  In  addition,  an  association  between  infection  by  Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) and HL has been suggested. A monoclonal or oligoclonal 
proliferation of EBV-infected cells in 20–40% of the patients with HL 
has led to proposals for this virus having an etiologic role in HL. How-
ever,  the  matter  is  not  settled  definitively.  Viral  oncogenesis  appears 
to  play  a  greater  role  in  HIV-related  cHL:  EBV  can  be  detected  in 
nearly  all  cases  of  HIV-associated  cHL,  compared  to  only  one-third 
of cases of non–HIV-associated cHL. Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells are 
the  malignant  cells  in  HL.  HRS  cells  in  HIV-associated  cHL  express 
the  EBV-transforming  protein  latent  membrane  protein  1  (LMP-1), 
and  the  EBV  genomes  from  multiple  disease  sites  in  the  same  HIV- 
associated cHL patient are episomal and clonal, suggesting that EBV is 
directly involved in early lymphomagenesis.

Histologically, the HRS cell is diagnostic of cHL (Fig. 109-1). These 
cells are large cells with abundant cytoplasm with bilobed and/or mul-
tiple nuclei. By immunohistochemistry, they are often PAX-5 positive 
but have low to no expression of other B-cell antigens like CD19 and  
CD20. They express CD15 and CD30 in 85 and 100% of cases, respec-
tively. These cells, though, comprise <1% of the tumor cellularity, with 
the  majority  of  the  tumor  made  up  of  a  surrounding  inflammatory 
infiltrate of polyclonal lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, macro-
phages, plasma cells, fibroblasts, and collagen. The HRS cell interacts 
with  its  microenvironment  via  cell-cell  contact  and  elaboration  of 
growth factors and cytokines, which results in a surrounding cellular 
milieu that protects it from host immune attack. The surrounding envi-
ronmental  cells  likewise  support  the  HRS  cells  via  cell-cell  signaling 
and cytokine production, which provides signals that promote prolifer-
ation and survival of the HRS cell itself. Interestingly, 97% of HRS cells 
in cHL harbor genetic aberrations in the PD-L1 locus on chromosome 
9p24.1, resulting in overexpression of PD-L1, the ligand for the inhib-
itory PD-1 receptor on immune cells. This is one mechanism whereby 
the HRS cell may be able to avoid immune destruction in its inflamma-
tory microenvironment and may contribute to the generalized immune 
suppression in HL patients.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

Most  patients  with  cHL  present  with  palpable  lymphadenopathy 
that  is  nontender;  in  most  patients,  these  lymph  nodes  are  in  the 
neck, supraclavicular area, and axilla. More than half of the patients 
will  have  mediastinal  adenopathy  at  diagnosis,  and  this  is  some-
times  the  initial  manifestation.  Subdiaphragmatic  presentation  of 
cHL  is  unusual  and  more  common  in  older  males.  One-third  of 
patients  present  with  fevers,  night  sweats,  and/or  weight  loss,  or 
“B” symptoms. Occasionally, HL can present as a fever of unknown 
origin.  This  is  more  common  in  older  patients  who  are  found  to 
have mixed-cellularity HL in an abdominal site. Rarely, the fevers 
persist  for  days  to  weeks,  followed  by  afebrile  intervals  and  then 
recurrence of the fever. This pattern is known as Pel-Ebstein fever. 
HL  can  occasionally  present  with  unusual  manifestations.  These 
include severe and unexplained itching, cutaneous disorders such 
as  erythema  nodosum  and  ichthyosiform  atrophy,  paraneoplastic 
cerebellar degeneration and other distant effects on the CNS, neph-
rotic syndrome, immune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, 
hypercalcemia, and pain in lymph nodes on alcohol ingestion.

Evaluation of patients with HL will typically begin with a careful 
history and physical examination. Patients should be asked about the 
presence or absence of “B” symptoms. Comorbid diagnoses that may 
impact therapy should be reviewed, including a history of pulmonary 
disease  and  congestive  heart  failure  given  the  use  of  chemotherapy 
drugs that can cause both lung and heart toxicity. A physical examina-
tion should pay attention to the peripherally accessible sites of lymph 
nodes and to the liver and spleen size. Laboratory evaluation should 
include a complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimen-
tation  rate  (ESR);  chemistry  studies  reflecting  major  organ  function 
including serum albumin; and HIV and hepatitis virus testing. A pos-
itron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan is 
used for staging and is more accurate than a bone marrow biopsy for 
evaluation of bone marrow involvement as the bone marrow involve-
ment in cHL tends to be patchy and therefore potentially missed on 
a  unilateral  bone  marrow  biopsy.  The  initial  evaluation  of  a  patient 
with HL or NHL is similar. In both situations, the determination of an 
accurate anatomic stage is an important part of the evaluation. Staging 
is done using the Ann Arbor staging system (Table 109-2).

The  diagnosis  of  HL  is  established  by  review  of  an  adequate 
biopsy  specimen  by  an  expert  hematopathologist.  HL  is  a  tumor 
characterized by rare neoplastic cells of B-cell origin (immunoglob-
ulin genes are rearranged but not expressed) in a tumor mass that 
is largely polyclonal inflammatory infiltrate, probably a reaction to 
cytokines  produced  by  the  tumor  cells.  The  differential  diagnosis 
of a lymph node biopsy suspicious for HL includes inflammatory 
processes,  mononucleosis,  NHL,  phenytoin-induced  adenopathy, 
and nonlymphomatous malignancies.

Staging for cHL is anatomically based given the propensity of the 
disease  to  march  from  one  lymph  node  group  to  the  next  group, 
often contiguous to the first. Staging is important for selecting ther-
apy of appropriate intensity, but the outcome of optimal therapy for 
all  the  stages  is  excellent.  Patients  are  stratified  based  on  whether 
they have early-stage disease (stage I or II) or advanced-stage disease 
(stage III or IV). Patients with early-stage disease have a better prog-
nosis  overall  but  are  further  classified  as  favorable  or  unfavorable 
based on a variety of factors. These factors vary from study to study 
but include bulky disease, number of lymph node areas involved, an 
elevated ESR (>30 if “B” symptoms are present; >50 if “B” symptoms 
are  absent),  and  age.  Prognosis  in  advanced-stage  disease  is  best 
predicted by the International Prognostic Score (IPS), which ascribes 
1 point for male sex, older age (>45 years), stage IV disease, serum 
albumin  <4  g/dL,  hemoglobin  <10.5  g/dL,  white  blood  cell  count 
≥15,000/μL, and a lymphocyte count <600/μL and/or <8% of white 
blood  cell  count.  Five-year  progression-free  survival  ranges  from 
88% for patients with no risk factors to 62% for patients with four or 
more factors, but very few patients have multiple risk factors.

TREATMENT
Classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma

The overwhelming majority of patients with HL will be cured with 
either chemotherapy alone or a combination of chemotherapy and 
radiation  therapy.  It  has  long  been  appreciated  that  patients  with 
advanced-stage disease do not benefit from the addition of radiation 
therapy  to  chemotherapy  and  are  thus  treated  with  chemotherapy 
alone.  For  early-stage  disease,  however,  treatment  with  combined-
modality therapy has been associated with a small decrease in risk of 
relapse but with an increased risk of late toxicity including secondary 
malignancies, thyroid disease, and premature cardiovascular disease 
and  stroke  resulting  in  minimal  or  no  improvement  in  long-term 
survival.  Much  of  this  risk  can  be  attributed  to  radiation  therapy. 
Thus, investigation into the treatment of early-stage HL at present 
is  aimed  at  trying  to  maximize  treatment  outcome  without  using 
radiotherapy. This is an area of controversy in the treatment of HL. 

EARLY-STAGE DISEASE
The  most  common  chemotherapy  regimen  used  to  treat  HL  in 
the  United  States  is  ABVD  (doxorubicin,  bleomycin,  vinblastine, 
and  dacarbazine).  This  regimen  is  given  every  other  week,  with 
each cycle including two treatments. In patients with low-risk, or 
favorable,  disease,  the  use  of  four  to  six  cycles  of  ABVD  alone, 
without  radiation  therapy,  results  in  progression-free  and  overall 
survival  rates  of  88–92%  and  97–100%,  respectively,  at  5–7  years. 
This may be associated with a slightly increased risk of relapse when 
compared with abbreviated chemotherapy (ABVD for four cycles) 
followed by involved field radiation therapy (30 Gy), but with no 
difference  in  overall  survival  owing  to  the  excellent  salvage  strat-
egies used for relapsed HL and to the late toxicities seen following 
radiation  therapy  to  the  chest.  German  studies  have  examined  a 
very  abbreviated  chemotherapy  regimen  (ABVD  for  two  cycles) 
and  low-dose  radiation  (20  Gy)  for  particularly  good-risk  disease 
with two or fewer lymph node areas involved and found that this 
was  equally  effective  to  standard  combined-modality  therapy  of 
ABVD for four cycles and 30 Gy of radiation. However, long-term 
follow-up  is  not  yet  available  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  lower

854

radiotherapy  dose  on  late  toxicities.  Finally,  the  use  of  an  early 
interim PET/CT scan can aid decisions regarding the duration and 
extent of therapy. In one study, a negative PET/CT scan after three 
cycles of ABVD predicted for excellent outcomes with no additional 
therapy;  in  another,  a  negative  PET/CT  scan  after  two  cycles  of 
ABVD predicted for good outcomes with two additional cycles of 
ABVD alone, without radiation therapy.

For  unfavorable-risk  disease,  the  omission  of  radiation  ther-
apy  following  chemotherapy  is  associated  with  a  more  significant 
increased  risk  of  relapse  compared  to  favorable-risk  disease,  but 
again with no change in overall survival. For these patients, treat-
ment  options  would  include  ABVD  for  four  cycles  followed  by 
involved  field  radiation  therapy  or  ABVD  alone  for  six  cycles. 
Treatment decisions are often based on the extent of the radiation 
field and the unfavorable risk factor, with patients with nonbulky 
disease being candidates for chemotherapy alone if radiation would 
be contraindicated for another reason. Combined modality therapy 
has  typically  been  used  for  patients  with  bulky  disease,  although 
patients with bulky disease who have a negative PET/CT scan after 
chemotherapy may not benefit from additional radiation therapy.

Alternative chemotherapy regimens to ABVD have been devel-
oped and include the Stanford V regimen and escalated BEACOPP 
(bleomycin,  etoposide,  doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  vincris-
tine, procarbazine, and prednisone). Neither of these regimens has 
resulted in improved outcomes in patients with early-stage disease. 

ADVANCED-STAGE DISEASE
Patients with advanced-stage disease do not benefit from the addi-
tion of radiation therapy after a complete response to chemotherapy 
alone  and  should  be  treated  with  chemotherapy  alone.  The  most 
common regimen used in the United States is ABVD for six cycles. 
Again, Stanford V and escalated BEACOPP have been evaluated in 
advanced-stage disease and are not associated with an improvement 
in  overall  survival  but  are  associated  with  increased  toxicity.  The 
small fraction of patients who do not achieve complete remission 
with  chemotherapy  alone  (partial  responders  with  persistent  PET 
scan positivity account for <10% of patients) may benefit from the 
addition of involved field radiotherapy.

Newer drugs have been developed for the treatment of relapsed 
HL (see “Relapsed Disease,” below). These include the antibody-drug 
conjugate brentuximab vedotin, which is an antibody against CD30 
conjugated  to  the  microtubule  inhibitor  monomethyl  auristatin  E 
(MMAE). This drug has been combined with doxorubicin, bleomy-
cin, and dacarbazine in early-phase studies for advanced-stage HL 
with favorable efficacy compared to historical controls. Eschelon-1, 
a  randomized  trial  of  doxorubicin,  vinblastine,  and  dacarbazine 
(AVD) plus brentuximab compared to ABVD, was a positive study 
in  that  it  demonstrated  an  improvement  in  progression-free  sur-
vival for AVD plus brentuximab, especially among younger patients, 
patients from North America, and patients with higher risk disease. 
Drugs that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been developed in an 
attempt to boost the host immune recognition of tumors. This was 
particularly attractive in HL given the overexpression of PD-L1 on 
the HRS cell surface. In the setting of relapsed disease, these drugs, 
which  include  pembrolizumab  and  nivolumab,  have  very  high 
response rates and are associated with durable responses. These are 
now being tested in conjunction with chemotherapy both as salvage 
therapy  for  relapsed  disease  and  in  previously  untreated  patients, 
including in a multicenter randomized trial against AVD plus bren-
tuximab as initial therapy for advanced-stage disease. 

RELAPSED DISEASE
Patients who relapse after primary therapy of HL can frequently still be 
cured. Patients who relapse after an effective chemotherapy regimen are 
usually not curable with subsequent chemotherapy administered at stan-
dard doses. Alternative salvage chemotherapy administered at standard 
doses, then, is given in order to document sensitivity to chemotherapy and 
to achieve maximum reduction of tumor mass. For patients who respond 
completely or nearly so, autologous stem cell transplantation can cure over 

half of patients. Standard salvage chemotherapy regimens include ICE 
(ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) and GND (gemcitabine, vinorel-
bine, and doxorubicin). Newer combinations, including brentuximab with 
either chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab, 
have also been tested with promising early results. For patients with early- 
stage disease who do not respond sufficiently to salvage chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy can be very effective to achieve a remission; whether 
to consolidate such a remission with an autologous stem cell transplant 
is  debated.  For  patients  with  advanced-stage  disease  in  whom  salvage 
chemotherapy fails, the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin, 
a  CD30-directed  antibody  linked  to  the  microtubule  toxin  MMAE, 
is active and can be tried as a bridge to allogeneic transplant. It is also 
used as a maintenance therapy following successful autologous stem cell 
transplantation based on results of a randomized trial versus observation. 
The anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, nivolumab and pembroli-
zumab, have efficacy in relapsed HL, and many responses are durable. 
Increasingly,  there  is  an  appreciation  that  use  of  checkpoint  inhibitors 
restores the HRS cell’s sensitivity to chemotherapy by unknown mech-
anisms;  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation  may  be  a  potentially 
curative  option  for  patients  who  had  previously  been  felt  to  have 
chemotherapy-resistant  disease.  Finally,  anti-CD30  chimeric  antigen 
receptor  (CAR)  T-cell  therapy  has  been  tested  in  multiply  relapsed 
cHL with promising early results; these products are now being tested 
in multicenter phase 2 clinical trials.

Two other options may be useful in the setting of disease relapse 
after  ABVD  chemotherapy.  Alkylating  agent–based  combinations 
such as ChlVPP (chlorambucil, vincristine, prednisone, and procar-
bazine) may be active in patients with disease resistant to ABVD. In 
addition, relapse following bone marrow transplant can be respon-
sive to weekly low-dose single-agent vinblastine. 

SURVIVORSHIP
Because of the very high cure rate in patients with HL, long-term 
complications  have  become  a  major  focus  for  clinical  research. 
In  fact,  in  some  series  of  patients  with  early-stage  disease,  more 
patients died from late complications of therapy than from HL itself. 
This is particularly true in patients with localized disease. The most 
serious  late  side  effects  include  second  malignancies  and  cardiac 
injury. Patients are at risk for the development of acute leukemia in 
the  first  10  years  after  treatment  with  combination  chemotherapy 
regimens that contain alkylating agents plus radiation therapy. The 
risk for development of acute leukemia is greater after MOPP-like 
(mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) and 
BEACOPP-like regimens than with ABVD. The risk of development 
of acute leukemia after treatment for HL is also related to the num-
ber of exposures to potentially leukemogenic agents (i.e., multiple 
treatments  after  relapse)  and  the  age  of  the  patient  being  treated, 
with those aged >60 years at particularly high risk. The development 
of carcinomas as a complication of treatment for HL is a major prob-
lem. These tumors usually occur ≥10 years after treatment and are 
associated with use of radiotherapy. For this reason, young women 
treated with thoracic radiotherapy for HL should institute screening 
mammograms  5–10  years  after  treatment,  and  all  patients  who 
receive  thoracic  radiotherapy  for  HL  should  be  discouraged  from 
smoking.  Mediastinal  radiation  also  accelerates  coronary  artery 
disease, and patients should be encouraged to minimize risk factors 
for coronary artery disease such as smoking and elevated cholesterol 
levels. Cervical radiation therapy increases the risk of carotid ath-
erosclerosis and stroke and thyroid disease, including cancer.

A number of other late side effects from the treatment of HL are 
well  known.  Patients  who  receive  thoracic  radiotherapy  are  at  very 
high risk for the eventual development of hypothyroidism and should 
be observed for this complication; intermittent measurement of thy-
rotropin should be made to identify the condition before it becomes 
symptomatic.  Lhermitte’s  syndrome  occurs  in  ∼15%  of  patients  who 
receive thoracic radiotherapy. This syndrome is manifested by an “elec-
tric shock” sensation into the lower extremities on flexion of the neck. 
Because of the young age at which HL is often diagnosed, infertility is 
a  concern  for  patients  undergoing  treatment  for  HL.  Chemotherapy

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyregimens  containing  alkylating  agents  induce  permanent  infertility 
in nearly all men. The risk of permanent infertility in women treated 
with  alkylating  agent–containing  chemotherapy  is  age-related,  with 
younger women more likely to recover fertility. Infertility is very rare 
after treatment with ABVD. 
NODULAR LYMPHOCYTE-PREDOMINANT HODGKIN’S 
LYMPHOMA
NLPHL is now recognized as an entity distinct from cHL. Previous 
classification systems recognized that biopsies from a small subset 
of patients diagnosed as having HL contained a predominance of 
small lymphocytes and rare Reed-Sternberg–like cells; tumors had 
a  nodular  growth  pattern  and  a  clinical  course  that  varied  from 
that  of  patients  with  cHL.  This  is  an  unusual  clinical  entity  and 
represents <5% of cases of HL and defines NLPHL.

NLPHL has a number of characteristics that suggest its relation-
ship to NHL, rather than cHL, however. The HRS-like cell, or L&H 
(lymphocyte  and  histiocyte)  or  “popcorn”  cell,  is  a  clonal  prolifer-
ation  of  B-cells  that  are  positive  for  B-cell  markers  CD45,  CD79a, 
CD20, CD19, and BCL2. They do not express two markers normally 
found on HRS cells, CD30 and CD15. This lymphoma tends to have 
a  chronic,  relapsing  course  and  sometimes  transforms  to  diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma, including a specific subtype of diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma known as T-cell/histiocyte–rich B-cell lymphoma, 
which shares an immunophenotype with the L&H cell. This natural 
history  most  closely  resembles  that  of  the  indolent  B-cell  NHLs 
outlined in Chaps. 108 and 110.

Patients with NLPHL are more commonly male (75%). Like cHL, 
the age distribution of patients with this disease has two peaks, but 
unlike cHL, these peaks include children and adults ages 30–40 years, 
respectively. The majority of patients diagnosed have stage I or II 
disease  (75%),  with  a  minority  having  advanced-stage  disease  at 
diagnosis. “B” symptoms are uncommon.

Patients  with  early-stage  disease  at  diagnosis  should  be  treated 
with definitive radiotherapy. This is associated with a 15-year nonre-
lapse survival rate of 82%. The treatment of patients with advanced-
stage  NLPHL  is  controversial.  Some  clinicians  favor  no  treatment 
of  asymptomatic  disease  and  merely  close  follow-up,  akin  to  the 
indolent B-cell NHLs. For patients who need therapy due to symp-
toms or signs of organ function impairment, both cHL regimens and 
B-cell NHL regimens have been used, including ABVD and R-CHOP 
(rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine,  and  pred-
nisone).  A  single-institution  experience  with  R-CHOP  resulted  in 
a 100% response rate in a small group of patients without a single 
relapse with 42 months of follow-up. Although this is short follow-up 
for an indolent disease, some believe R-CHOP may be curative in this 
disease and advocate treating patients with advanced-stage disease at 
diagnosis, regardless of symptoms or organ function.

110 Less Common Lymphoid  
and Myeloid Malignancies
Ayalew Tefferi, Dan L. Longo

The  most  common  lymphoid  malignancies  are  discussed  in  Chaps. 
106,  107,  108,  109,  and  111,  myeloid  leukemias  in  Chaps.  104  and 
105, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in Chap. 102, and myelopro-
liferative syndromes in Chap. 103. This chapter will focus on the more 
unusual forms of hematologic malignancy. The diseases discussed here 
are  listed  in  Table  110-1.  Each  of  these  entities  accounts  for  <1%  of 
hematologic neoplasms.

lymphocyte), round lymphocytes with a prominent nucleolus and light 
blue cytoplasm on Wright’s stain. It predominantly affects the blood, 
bone marrow (BM), and spleen and usually does not cause adenopa-
thy. The median age of affected patients is 70 years, and men are more 
often affected than women (male-to-female ratio is 1.6). This entity is 
distinct from chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and does not develop 
as a consequence of that disease.

Clinical presentation is generally from symptoms of splenomegaly 
or incidental detection of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. 
The clinical course can be rapid. The cells express surface IgM (with 
or  without  IgD)  and  typical  B-cell  markers  (CD19,  CD20,  CD22). 
CD23 is absent, and about one-third of cases express CD5. The CD5 
expression along with the presence of the t(11;14) translocation in 20% 
of cases leads to confusion in distinguishing B-PLL from the leukemic 
form of mantle cell lymphoma. No reliable criteria for the distinction 
have emerged, and gene expression studies suggest a close relationship 
between mantle cell lymphoma and B-PLL and significant differences 
with  CLL.  About  half  of  patients  have  mutation  or  loss  of  p53,  and 
deletions have been noted in 11q23 and 13q14. Nucleoside analogues 
like fludarabine and cladribine and combination chemotherapy (cyclo-
phosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP]) have 
produced responses. CHOP plus rituximab may be more effective than 
CHOP alone, but the disease is sufficiently rare that large series have 
not  been  reported.  Splenectomy  can  produce  palliation  of  symptoms 
but appears to have little or no impact on the course of the disease. BM 
transplantation may be curative. Imatinib may also have activity.

Splenic  Marginal  Zone  Lymphoma  (SMZL)  This  tumor  of 
mainly small lymphocytes originates in the marginal zone of the spleen 
white  pulp,  grows  to  efface  the  germinal  centers  and  mantle,  and 
invades  the  red  pulp.  Splenic  hilar  nodes,  BM,  and  peripheral  blood 
(PB) may be involved. The circulating tumor cells have short surface 
villi and are called villous lymphocytes. Table 110-2 shows differences 
in tumor cells of a number of neoplasms of small lymphocytes that aid 
in the differential diagnosis. SMZL cells express surface immunoglobu-
lin and CD20 but are negative for CD5, CD10, CD43, and CD103. Lack 
of  CD5  distinguishes  SMZL  from  CLL,  and  lack  of  CD103  separates 
SMZL from hairy cell leukemia.

The median age of patients with SMZL is mid-fifties, and men and 
women  are  equally  represented.  Patients  present  with  incidental  or 
symptomatic  splenomegaly  or  incidental  detection  of  lymphocytosis 
in  the  PB  with  villous  lymphocytes.  Autoimmune  anemia  or  throm-
bocytopenia may be present. The immunoglobulin produced by these 
cells contains somatic mutations that reflect transit through a germinal 
center,  and  ongoing  mutations  suggest  that  the  mutation  machinery 
has  remained  active.  About  40%  of  patients  have  either  deletions  or 
translocations involving 7q21, the site of the FLNC gene (filamin Cγ, 
involved in cross-linking actin filaments in the cytoplasm). NOTCH2 
mutations are seen in 25% of patients. Chromosome 8p deletions may

also be noted. The genetic lesions typically found in extranodal mar-
ginal  zone  lymphomas  (e.g.,  trisomy  3  and  t[11;18])  are  uncommon 
in SMZL.

The clinical course of disease is generally indolent with median sur-
vivals exceeding 10 years. Patients with elevated lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) levels, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia generally have a poorer 
prognosis. Long remissions can be seen after splenectomy. Rituximab, 
ibrutinib,  and  PI3  kinase  inhibitors  are  also  active.  A  small  fraction 
of patients undergo histologic progression to diffuse large B-cell lym-
phoma with a concomitant change to a more aggressive natural history. 
Experience with combination chemotherapy in SMZL is limited.

Hairy Cell Leukemia  Hairy cell leukemia is a tumor of small lym-
phocytes with oval nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and distinctive mem-
brane projections (hairy cells). Patients have splenomegaly and diffuse 
BM  involvement.  While  some  circulating  cells  are  noted,  the  clinical 
picture  is  dominated  by  symptoms  from  the  enlarged  spleen  and 
pancytopenia. The mechanism of the pancytopenia is not completely 
clear and may be mediated by both inhibitory cytokines and marrow 
replacement.  The  marrow  has  an  increased  level  of  reticulin  fibers; 
indeed, hairy cell leukemia is a common cause of inability to aspirate 
BM or so-called “dry tap” (Table 110-3). Monocytopenia is profound 
and  may  explain  a  predisposition  to  atypical  mycobacterial  infection 
that  is  observed  clinically.  The  tumor  cells  have  strong  expression  of 
CD22, CD25, and CD103; soluble CD25 level in serum is an excellent 
tumor  marker  for  disease  activity.  The  cells  also  express  tartrate- 
resistant acid phosphatase. The immunoglobulin genes are rearranged 
and mutated, indicating the influence of a germinal center. No specific 
cytogenetic  abnormality  has  been  found,  but  most  cases  contain  the 
activating BRAF mutation V600E.

The  median  age  of  affected  patients  is  mid-fifties,  and  the  male-
to-female ratio is 5:1. Treatment options are numerous. Splenectomy 
is  often  associated  with  prolonged  remission.  Nucleosides  including 
cladribine  and  deoxycoformycin  are  highly  active  but  are  also  asso-
ciated  with  further  immunosuppression  and  can  increase  the  risk  of 
certain opportunistic infections. However, after brief courses of these 
agents, patients usually obtain very durable remissions during which 
immune  function  spontaneously  recovers.  Interferon  α  is  also  an 
effective therapy but is not as effective as nucleosides. Chemotherapy- 
refractory patients have responded to vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. 
Vemurafenib  does  not  appear  to  be  curative,  but  responses  can  be 
maintained  with  chronic  treatment.  More  durable  remissions  occur 
when rituximab is added to vemurafenib.

Nodal Marginal Zone B Cell Lymphoma  This rare node-based 
disease  bears  an  uncertain  relationship  with  extranodal  marginal 
zone  lymphomas,  which  are  often  mucosa-associated  and  are  called 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, and SMZLs. 
Patients may have localized or generalized adenopathy. The neoplastic 
cell is a marginal zone B cell with monocytoid features and has been 
called  monocytoid  B  cell  lymphoma  in  the  past.  Up  to  one-third 
of  the  patients  may  have  extranodal  involvement,  and  involvement 
of  the  lymph  nodes  can  be  secondary  to  the  spread  of  a  mucosal 
primary  lesion.  In  authentic  nodal  primaries,  the  cytogenetic  abnor-
malities  associated  with  MALT  lymphomas  (trisomy  3  and  t[11;18]) 
are  very  rare.  The  clinical  course  is  indolent.  Patients  often  respond

to  combination  chemotherapy,  although  remissions  have  not  been 
durable.  Few  patients  have  received  CHOP  plus  rituximab,  which  is 
likely to be an effective approach to management.

Mediastinal  (Thymic)  Large  B-Cell  Lymphoma  This  entity 
was  originally  considered  a  subset  of  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma; 
however, additional study has identified it as a distinct entity with its 
own  characteristic  clinical,  genetic,  and  immunophenotypic  features. 
This is a disease that can be bulky in size but usually remains confined 
to the mediastinum. It can be locally aggressive, including progressing 
to produce a superior vena cava obstruction syndrome or pericardial 
effusion.  About  one-third  of  patients  develop  pleural  effusions,  and 
in 5–10% of cases, disease can disseminate widely to kidney, adrenal, 
liver, skin, and even brain. The disease affects women more often than 
men (male-to-female ratio is 1:2–3), and the median age is 35–40 years.
The  tumor  is  composed  of  sheets  of  large  cells  with  abundant 
cytoplasm  accompanied  by  variable,  but  often  abundant,  fibrosis.  It 
is  distinguished  from  nodular  sclerosing  Hodgkin’s  disease  by  the 
paucity of normal lymphoid cells and the absence of lacunar variants 
of  Reed-Sternberg  cells.  However,  more  than  one-third  of  the  genes 
that  are  expressed  to  a  greater  extent  in  primary  mediastinal  large 
B-cell lymphoma than in usual diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are also 
overexpressed in Hodgkin’s disease, suggesting a possible pathogenetic 
relationship  between  the  two  entities  that  affect  the  same  anatomic 
site. Tumor cells may overexpress MAL. The genome of tumor cells is 
characterized  by  frequent  chromosomal  gains  and  losses.  The  tumor 
cells in mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma express CD20, but surface 
immunoglobulin  and  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  class  I  and  
class II molecules may be absent or incompletely expressed. Expression 
of lower levels of class II HLA identifies a subset with poorer progno-
sis. The cells are CD5 and CD10 negative but may show light staining 
with  anti-CD30.  The  cells  are  CD45  positive,  unlike  cells  of  classical 
Hodgkin’s disease.

Methotrexate,  leucovorin,  doxorubicin,  cyclophosphamide,  vin-
cristine,  prednisone,  and  bleomycin  (MACOP-B)  and  rituximab  plus 
CHOP are effective treatments, achieving 5-year survival of 75–87%. 
Dose-adjusted therapy with prednisone, etoposide, vincristine, cyclo-
phosphamide,  and  doxorubicin  (EPOCH)  plus  rituximab  has  pro-
duced 5-year survival of 97%. A role for mediastinal radiation therapy 
has not been definitively demonstrated, but it is frequently used, espe-
cially  in  patients  whose  mediastinal  area  remains  positron  emission 
tomography–avid after 4–6 cycles of chemotherapy.

Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma  This is an extremely rare 
form of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of 
lymphoma in the lumen of small vessels, particularly capillaries. It is also 
known  as  malignant  angioendotheliomatosis  or  angiotropic  large-cell 
lymphoma. It is sufficiently rare that no consistent picture has emerged 
to define a clinical syndrome or its epidemiologic and genetic features. 
It  is  thought  to  remain  inside  vessels  because  of  a  defect  in  adhesion 
molecules  and  homing  mechanisms,  an  idea  supported  by  scant  data 
suggesting absence of expression of β-1 integrin and ICAM-1. Patients 
commonly  present  with  symptoms  of  small-vessel  occlusion,  skin 
lesions, or neurologic symptoms. The tumor cell clusters can promote 
thrombus formation. A subset of patients have tumors with MYD88 or 
CD79B mutations. In general, the clinical course is aggressive and the 
disease is poorly responsive to therapy. Often a diagnosis is not made 
until very late in the course of the disease or at autopsy.

857

are  large  with  large  nuclei  and  prominent  nucleoli  that  can  be  con-
fused  with  Reed-Sternberg  cells.  The  cells  express  CD20  and  CD79a  
(immunoglobulin-signaling  molecule),  although  they  often  do  not 
express immunoglobulin. Some cases aberrantly express T-cell mark-
ers such as CD3 or rearranged T-cell receptor genes. No characteristic 
genetic lesions have been reported, but gains in chromosome 12 and X 
material have been seen, similar to other HIV-associated lymphomas. 
The clinical course is generally characterized by rapid progression and 
death within 6 months. CHOP plus lenalidomide or bortezomib may 
produce responses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV should 
be maintained during treatment.

Lymphomatoid  Granulomatosis  This 
is  an  angiocentric, 
angiodestructive  lymphoproliferative  disease  comprised  by  neoplas-
tic  Epstein-Barr  virus–infected  monoclonal  B  cells  accompanied  and 
outnumbered  by  a  polyclonal  reactive  T-cell  infiltrate.  The  disease  is 
graded based on histologic features such as cell number and atypia in 
the B cells. It is most often confused with extranodal NK/T-cell lym-
phoma, nasal type, which can also be angiodestructive and is Epstein-
Barr  virus–related.  The  disease  usually  presents  in  adults  (males  >  
females) as a pulmonary infiltrate. Involvement is often entirely extra-
nodal  and  can  include  kidney  (32%),  liver  (29%),  skin  (25%),  and 
brain (25%). The disease often but not always occurs in the setting of 
immune deficiency.

The disease can be remitting and relapsing in nature or can be rap-
idly progressive. The course is usually predicted by the histologic grade. 
The disease is highly responsive to combination chemotherapy and is 
curable in most cases. Some investigators have claimed that low-grade 
disease (grade I and II) can be treated with interferon α.

 ■ MATURE T-CELL AND NK CELL NEOPLASMS
T-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukemia  This is an aggressive leuke-
mia  of  medium-sized  prolymphocytes  involving  the  blood,  marrow, 
nodes, liver, spleen, and skin. It accounts for 1–2% of all small lympho-
cytic leukemias. Most patients present with elevated WBC count (often 
>100,000/μL), hepatosplenomegaly, and adenopathy. Skin involvement 
occurs  in  20%.  The  diagnosis  is  made  from  PB  smear,  which  shows 
cells about 25% larger than those in small lymphocytes, with cytoplas-
mic  blebs  and  nuclei  that  may  be  indented.  The  cells  express  T-cell 
markers like CD2, CD3, and CD7; two-thirds of patients have cells that 
are  CD4+  and  CD8–,  and  25%  have  cells  that  are  CD4+  and  CD8+. 
T-cell  receptor  β  chains  are  clonally  rearranged.  In  80%  of  patients, 
inversion of chromosome 14 occurs between q11 and q32. Ten percent 
have  t(14;14)  translocations  that  bring  the  T-cell  receptor  alpha/beta 
gene  locus  into  juxtaposition  with  oncogenes  TCL1  and  TCL1b  at 
14q32.1.  Chromosome  8  abnormalities  are  also  common.  Deletions 
in the ATM gene are also noted. Activating JAK3 mutations have also 
been reported.

The course of the disease is generally rapid, with median survival of 
about 12 months. Responses have been seen with the anti-CD52 anti-
body alemtuzumab, nucleoside analogues, and CHOP chemotherapy. 
Histone deacetylase inhibitors like vorinostat and romidepsin may also 
have  activity.  Small  numbers  of  patients  with  T-cell  prolymphocytic 
leukemia have also been treated with high-dose therapy, and allogeneic 
BM  transplantation  after  remission  has  been  achieved  with  alemtu-
zumab or conventional-dose therapy.

Primary  Effusion  Lymphoma  This  entity  is  another  variant  of 
diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  that  presents  with  pleural  effusions, 
usually  without  apparent  tumor  mass  lesions.  It  is  most  common  in 
the  setting  of  immune  deficiency  disease,  especially  AIDS,  and  is 
caused  by  human  herpes  virus  8  (HHV-8)/Kaposi’s  sarcoma  herpes 
virus (KSHV). It is also known as body cavity–based lymphoma. Some 
patients have been previously diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma. It can 
also occur in the absence of immunodeficiency in elderly men of Med-
iterranean heritage, similar to Kaposi’s sarcoma but even less common.
The  malignant  effusions  contain  cells  positive  for  HHV-8/KSHV, 
and  many  are  also  co-infected  with  Epstein-Barr  virus.  The  cells 

T-Cell  Large  Granular  Lymphocytic  Leukemia  T-cell  large  
granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia is characterized by increases in 
the  number  of  LGLs  in  the  PB  (2000–20,000/μL)  often  accompanied 
by severe neutropenia, with or without concomitant anemia. Patients 
may  have  splenomegaly  and  frequently  have  evidence  of  systemic 
autoimmune  disease,  including  rheumatoid  arthritis,  hypergamma-
globulinemia, autoantibodies, and circulating immune complexes. BM 
involvement is mainly interstitial in pattern, with <50% lymphocytes on 
differential count. Usually the cells express CD3, T-cell receptors, and 
CD8; NK-like variants may be CD3–. The leukemic cells often express 
Fas and Fas ligand.

The  course  of  the  disease  is  generally  indolent  and  dominated  by 
the  neutropenia.  Paradoxically,  immunosuppressive  therapy  with 
cyclosporine, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide plus glucocorticoids 
can produce an increase in granulocyte counts. Nucleosides have been 
used  anecdotally.  Occasionally  the  disease  can  accelerate  to  a  more 
aggressive clinical course.

Aggressive  NK  Cell  Leukemia  NK  neoplasms  are  very  rare, 
and  they  may  follow  a  range  of  clinical  courses  from  very  indolent 
to  highly  aggressive.  They  are  more  common  in  Asians  than  whites, 
and  the  cells  frequently  harbor  a  clonal  Epstein-Barr  virus  episome. 
The PB white count is usually not greatly elevated, but abnormal large 
lymphoid cells with granular cytoplasm are noted. The aggressive form 
is characterized by symptoms of fever and laboratory abnormalities of 
pancytopenia.  Hepatosplenomegaly  is  common;  node  involvement  is 
less common. Patients may have hemophagocytosis, coagulopathy, or 
multiorgan failure. Serum levels of Fas ligand are elevated.

The  cells  express  CD2  and  CD56  and  do  not  have  rearranged  
T-cell receptor genes. Deletions involving chromosome 6 are common. 
The disease can be rapidly progressive. Some forms of NK neoplasms 
are more indolent. They tend to be discovered incidentally with LGL 
lymphocytosis and do not manifest the fever and hepatosplenomegaly 
characteristic of the aggressive leukemia. The cells are also CD2 and 
CD56 positive, but they do not contain clonal forms of Epstein-Barr 
virus  and  are  not  accompanied  by  pancytopenia  or  autoimmune 
disease.

Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type  Like lympho-
matoid  granulomatosis,  extranodal  NK/T-cell  lymphoma  tends  to  be 
an angiocentric and angiodestructive lesion, but the malignant cells are 
not B cells. In most cases, they are CD56+ Epstein-Barr virus–infected 
cells; occasionally, they are CD56–Epstein-Barr virus–infected cytotoxic 
T cells. They are most commonly found in the nasal cavity. Historically, 
this  illness  was  called  lethal  midline  granuloma,  polymorphic  reticu-
losis,  and  angiocentric  immunoproliferative  lesion.  This  form  of  lym-
phoma is prevalent in Asia, Mexico, and Central and South America; it 
affects males more commonly than females. When it spreads beyond the 
nasal cavity, it may affect soft tissue, the gastrointestinal tract, or the tes-
tis. In some cases, hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) may influence the 
clinical picture. Patients may have B symptoms. Many of the systemic 
manifestations of disease are related to the production of cytokines by 
the tumor cells and the cells responding to their signals. Deletions and 
inversions of chromosome 6 are common.

Many  patients  with  extranodal  NK/T-cell  lymphoma,  nasal  type, 
have  excellent  antitumor  responses  with  combination  chemotherapy 
regimens, particularly those with localized disease. Radiation therapy 
is often used after completion of chemotherapy. Four risk factors have 
been  defined,  including  B  symptoms,  advanced  stage,  elevated  LDH, 
and regional lymph node involvement. Patient survival is linked to the 
number of risk factors: 5-year survival is 81% for zero risk factors, 64% 
for one risk factor, 32% for two risk factors, and 7% for three or four 
risk factors. Combination regimens without anthracyclines have been 
touted  as  superior  to  CHOP,  but  data  are  sparse.  High-dose  therapy 
with stem cell transplantation has been used, but its role is unclear.

Enteropathy-Type T-Cell Lymphoma  Enteropathy-type  T-cell 
lymphoma is a rare complication of longstanding celiac disease. It most 
commonly occurs in the jejunum or the ileum. In adults, the lymphoma 
may be diagnosed at the same time as celiac disease, but the suspicion 
is that the celiac disease was a longstanding precursor to the develop-
ment of lymphoma. The tumor usually presents as multiple ulcerating 
mucosal masses, but may also produce a dominant exophytic mass or 
multiple ulcerations. The tumor expresses CD3 and CD7 nearly always 
and may or may not express CD8. The normal-appearing lymphocytes 
in the adjacent mucosa often have a similar phenotype to the tumor. 
Most  patients  have  the  HLA  genotype  associated  with  celiac  disease, 
HLA DQA1*0501 or DQB1*0201.

The prognosis of this form of lymphoma is typically poor (median 
survival is 7 months), but some patients have a good response to CHOP 
chemotherapy.  Patients  who  respond  can  develop  bowel  perforation 

from responding tumor. If the tumor responds to treatment, recurrence 
may develop elsewhere in the celiac disease–affected small bowel.

Hepatosplenic  T-Cell  Lymphoma  Hepatosplenic  T-cell  lym-
phoma  is  a  malignancy  derived  from  T  cells  expressing  the  gamma/
delta  T-cell  antigen  receptor  that  affects  mainly  the  liver  and  fills 
the  sinusoids  with  medium-size  lymphoid  cells.  When  the  spleen  is 
involved, dominantly the red pulp is infiltrated. It is a disease of young 
people, especially young people with an underlying immunodeficiency 
or  with  an  autoimmune  disease  that  demands  immunosuppressive 
therapy. The use of thiopurine and infliximab is particularly common 
in  the  history  of  patients  with  this  disease.  The  cells  are  CD3+  and 
usually  CD4–  and  CD8–.  The  cells  may  contain  isochromosome  7q, 
often together with trisomy 8. The lymphoma has an aggressive natural 
history. Combination chemotherapy may induce remissions, but most 
patients relapse. Median survival is about 2 years. The tumor does not 
appear to respond to reversal of immunosuppressive therapy.

Subcutaneous  Panniculitis-Like  T-Cell  Lymphoma  
Subcutaneous  panniculitis-like  T-cell  lymphoma  involves  multiple 
subcutaneous  collections  of  neoplastic  T  cells  that  are  usually  cyto-
toxic  cells  in  phenotype  (i.e.,  contain  perforin  and  granzyme  B  and 
express  CD3  and  CD8).  The  rearranged  T-cell  receptor  is  usually 
alpha/beta-derived,  but  occasionally,  the  gamma/delta  receptors  are 
involved, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression. The cells 
are negative for Epstein-Barr virus. Patients may have an HPS in addi-
tion to the skin infiltration; fever and hepatosplenomegaly may also be 
present. Nodes are generally not involved. Patients frequently respond 
to  combination  chemotherapy,  including  CHOP.  When  the  disease 
is progressive, the HPS can be a component of a fulminant downhill 
course. Effective therapy can reverse the HPS.

Blastic  NK  Cell  Lymphoma  The  neoplastic  cells  express  NK 
cell  markers,  especially  CD56,  and  are  CD3  negative.  They  are  large 
blastic-appearing  cells  and  may  produce  a  leukemia  picture,  but  the 
dominant site of involvement is the skin. Morphologically, the cells are 
similar to the neoplastic cells in acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia. 
No  characteristic  chromosomal  abnormalities  have  been  described. 
The clinical course is rapid, and the disease is largely unresponsive to 
typical lymphoma treatments.

Primary  Cutaneous  CD30+  T-Cell  Lymphoma  This  tumor 
involves  the  skin  and  is  composed  of  cells  that  appear  similar  to  the 
cells of anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. Among cutaneous T-cell tumors, 
~25%  are  CD30+  anaplastic  lymphomas.  If  dissemination  to  lymph 
nodes occurs, it is difficult to distinguish between the cutaneous and 
systemic forms of the disease. The tumor cells are often CD4+, and the 
cells  contain  granules  that  are  positive  for  granzyme  B  and  perforin 
in  70%  of  cases.  The  typical  t(2;5)  of  anaplastic  T-cell  lymphoma  is 
absent; indeed, its presence should prompt a closer look for systemic 
involvement and a switch to a diagnosis of anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. 
This  form  of  lymphoma  has  sporadically  been  noted  as  a  rare  com-
plication  of  silicone  or  saline  breast  implants.  The  natural  history  of 
breast implant–associated lymphoma is generally indolent. Cutaneous 
CD30+  T-cell  lymphoma  often  responds  to  therapy.  The  anti-CD30 
immunotoxin conjugate brentuximab vedotin is active. Radiation ther-
apy can be effective, and surgery can also produce long-term disease 
control. Five-year survival exceeds 90%.

Angioimmunoblastic T-Cell Lymphoma  Angioimmunoblastic 
T-cell  lymphoma  is  a  systemic  disease  that  accounts  for  ~15%  of  all 
T-cell lymphomas. Patients frequently have fever, advanced stage, dif-
fuse adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin rash, polyclonal hypergam-
maglobulinemia,  and  a  wide  range  of  autoantibodies  including  cold 
agglutinins,  rheumatoid  factor,  and  circulating  immune  complexes. 
Patients may have edema, arthritis, pleural effusions, and ascites. The 
nodes  contain  a  polymorphous  infiltrate  of  neoplastic  T  cells  and 
nonneoplastic  inflammatory  cells  together  with  proliferation  of  high 
endothelial  venules  and  follicular  dendritic  cells  (FDCs).  The  most 
common  chromosomal  abnormalities  are  trisomy  3,  trisomy  5,  and 
an  extra  X  chromosome.  Aggressive  combination  chemotherapy  can

lymphoma treatments more likely to produce infectious complications.

RARE MYELOID MALIGNANCIES
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  system  uses  PB  counts  and 
smear  analysis,  BM  morphology,  and  cytogenetic  and  molecular 
genetic  tests  in  order  to  classify  myeloid  malignancies  into  several 
major categories (Table 110-4). Among them, acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) is discussed in Chap. 104, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
in  Chap.  102,  chronic  myeloid  leukemia  (CML)  in  Chap.  105,  and 
JAK2  mutation–enriched  myeloproliferative  neoplasms  (MPNs)  in 
Chap. 103. In this chapter, we focus on the rest (listed in Table 110-4) 
including chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL); atypical CML, BCR-
ABL1 negative (aCML); chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); 
juvenile  myelomonocytic  leukemia  (JMML);  chronic  eosinophilic 
leukemia,  not  otherwise  specified  (CEL-NOS);  mastocytosis;  MPN, 
unclassifiable  (MPN-U);  MDS/MPN,  unclassifiable  (MDS/MPN-U); 
MDS/MPN  with  ring  sideroblasts  and  thrombocytosis  (MDS/MPN-
RS-T); and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rear-
rangements  of  PDGFRA,  PDGFRB,  or  FGFR1  or  with  PCM1-JAK2. 
This  chapter  also  includes  histiocytic  and  dendritic  cell  neoplasms, 
transient  myeloproliferative  disorders,  and  a  broader  discussion  on 
primary eosinophilic disorders including hypereosinophilic syndrome 
(HES).
 ■ CHRONIC NEUTROPHILIC LEUKEMIA
CNL  is  a  clonal  proliferation  of  mature  neutrophils  with  few  or  no 
circulating immature granulocytes. In 2013, CNL was described to be 
associated  with  activating  mutations  of  the  gene  (CSF3R)  encoding

for  the  receptor  for  granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor  (G-CSF), 
also known as colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3). Patients with CNL 
might be asymptomatic at presentation but also display constitutional 
symptoms,  splenomegaly,  anemia,  and  thrombocytopenia.  Median 
survival is approximately 2 years and causes of death include leukemic 
transformation, progressive disease associated with severe cytopenias 
and marked treatment-refractory leukocytosis. The true incidence of 
CNL is not known due to diagnostic uncertainty with >200 currently 
reported cases. Median age at diagnosis is approximately 67 years with 
a slight male preponderance in gender distribution.

Pathogenesis  CSF3  is  the  main  growth  factor  for  granulocyte 
proliferation  and  differentiation.  Accordingly,  recombinant  CSF3  is 
used  for  the  treatment  of  severe  neutropenia,  including  severe  con-
genital  neutropenia  (SCN).  Some  patients  with  SCN  acquire  CSF3R 
mutations,  and  the  frequency  of  such  mutations  is  significantly 
higher  (~80%)  in  patients  who  experience  leukemic  transformation. 
SCN-associated  CSF3R  mutations  occur  in  the  region  of  the  gene 
coding for the cytoplasmic domain of CSF3R and result in truncation 
of the C-terminal-negative regulatory domain. In 2013, Maxson et al 
described  a  different  class  of  CSF3R  mutations  in  ~  90%  of  patients 
with CNL; these were mostly membrane proximal, the most frequent 
being  a  C-to-T  substitution  at  nucleotide  1853  (T618I).  In  a  subse-
quent confirmatory study, CSF3R mutations were found to be specific 
to  WHO-defined  CNL.  About  40%  of  the  T618I-mutated  cases  also 
harbored SETBP1 mutations. CSF3R T618I has been shown to induce 
lethal myeloproliferative disorder in a mouse model and in vitro sensi-
tivity to JAK inhibition.

Diagnosis  Diagnosis of CNL requires exclusion of the more com-
mon  causes  of  neutrophilia  including  infections  and  inflammatory 
processes.  In  addition,  one  should  be  mindful  of  the  association 
between  some  forms  of  metastatic  cancer  or  plasma  cell  neoplasms 
with  secondary  neutrophilia.  Neoplastic  neutrophilia  also  occurs  in 
other  BCR-ABL1-negative  myeloid  malignancies  including  aCML 
and  CMML.  Accordingly,  the  WHO  diagnostic  criteria  for  CNL  are 
designed  to  exclude  the  possibilities  of  both  secondary/reactive  neu-
trophilia and leukocytosis associated with myeloid malignancies other 
than CNL (Table 110-5): leukocytosis (≥25 × 109/L), ≥80% segmented/
band  neutrophils,  <10%  immature  myeloid  cells,  <1%  circulating 
blasts,  and  absence  of  dysgranulopoiesis  or  monocytosis  (monocyte 
count <1 × 109/L). BM in CNL is hypercellular and displays increased 
number  and  percentage  of  neutrophils  with  a  very  high  myeloid-to-
erythroid ratio and minimal left shift, myeloid dysplasia, or reticulin 
fibrosis.

The  recent  discovery  of  CSF3R  mutations  (see  above)  and  their 
almost invariable association with WHO-defined CNL has allowed its 
incorporation in the WHO diagnostic criteria (Table 110-5). In prac-
tical terms, the presence of a membrane proximal CSF3R mutation in 
a  patient  with  predominantly  neutrophilic  granulocytosis  should  be 
sufficient for the diagnosis of CNL, regardless of the degree of leuko-
cytosis. Unfortunately, several exclusionary criteria still need to be met 
for diagnosing CNL in the absence of CSF3R mutations (Table 110-5).

Treatment  Current treatment in CNL is largely palliative and sub-
optimal in its efficacy. Several drugs alone or in combination have been 
tried,  and  none  have  shown  remarkable  efficacy.  As  such,  allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) is reasonable to consider 
in the presence of symptomatic disease, especially in younger patients. 
Otherwise,  cytoreductive  therapy  with  hydroxyurea  is  probably  as 
good  as  anything,  and  a  more  intensive  combination  chemotherapy 
may  not  have  additional  value.  However,  response  to  hydroxyurea 
therapy is often transient, and some have successfully used interferon α 
as an alternative drug. Response to treatment with ruxolitinib (a JAK1 
and JAK2 inhibitor) has been reported in several case reports, but as 
is the case with hydroxyurea treatment, the response was often incom-
plete and temporary. In a recently reported phase 2 study of ruxolitinib 
in 44 patients with CNL or aCML, 21 patients had CNL (76% harbored 
CSF3R  mutations),  of  whom  only  4  (20%)  experienced  complete  or 
partial response according to conventional response criteria.

 ■ ATYPICAL CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA
“Atypical  chronic  myeloid  leukemia,  BCR-ABL1  negative  (aCML)” 
is  formally  classified  under  the  MDS/MPN  category  of  myeloid 
malignancies  and  is  characterized  by  left-shifted  granulocytosis  and 
dysgranulopoiesis. The differential diagnosis of aCML includes CML, 
which is distinguished by the presence of BCR-ABL1; CNL, which is 
distinguished  by  the  absence  of  dysgranulopoiesis  and  presence  of 
CSF3R mutations; and CMML, which is distinguished by the presence 
of  monocytosis  (absolute  monocyte  count  ≥1  ×  109/L).  The  WHO 
diagnostic criteria for aCML are listed in Table 110-5 and include gran-
ulocytosis; dysgranulopoiesis; ≥10% immature granulocytes; <20% PB 
or  BM  myeloblasts;  <10%  PB  monocytes;  <2%  basophils;  absence  of 
otherwise specific mutations such as BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, 
FGFR1,  or  PCM1-JAK2;  and  not  meeting  WHO  criteria  for  CML, 
primary  myelofibrosis  (PMF),  polycythemia  vera  (PV),  or  essential 
thrombocytopenia  (ET).  The  BM  in  aCML  is  hypercellular  with 
granulocyte  proliferation  and  dysplasia  with  or  without  erythroid  or 
megakaryocytic dysplasia.

The molecular pathogenesis of aCML is incompletely understood; 
about a fourth of patients express SETBP1 mutations, which are, how-
ever, also found in several other myeloid malignancies, including CNL 
and CMML. SETBP1 mutations in aCML are prognostically detrimen-
tal and mostly located between codons 858 and 871; similar mutations 
are  seen  with  Schinzel-Giedion  syndrome  (a  congenital  disease  with 
severe  developmental  delay  and  various  physical  stigmata  including 
midface retraction, large forehead, and macroglossia). More recently, a 
somatic missense mutation in ethanolamine kinase 1 (ETNK1 N244S) 
was described in 9% of patients with aCML but was also seen in 14% 
of patients with CMML, 6% of patients with mastocytosis (especially in 
association with eosinophilia), and rarely in other MPNs.

In a series of 55 patients with WHO-defined aCML, median age at 
diagnosis was 62 years with female preponderance (57%); splenomeg-
aly was reported in 54% of the patients, red cell transfusion require-
ment in 65%, abnormal karyotype in 20% (20q– and trisomy 8 being 
the  most  frequent),  and  leukemic  transformation  in  40%.  Median 
survival was 25 months. Outcome was worse in patients with marked 
leukocytosis,  transfusion  requirement,  and  increased  immature  cells 
in  the  PB.  In  a  more  recent  Mayo  Clinic  study  of  25  molecularly 
annotated and strictly WHO-defined aCML patients, median age was 
70 years and 84% were male. Cytogenetic abnormalities were seen in 
36% and gene mutations in 100%. Mutational frequencies were as fol-
lows: ASXL1 28%, TET2 16%, NRAS 16%, SETBP1 12%, RUNX1 12%, 
ETNK1 8%, and PTPN11 4%. Median survival was 10.8 months, and 
at last follow-up (median 11 months), 17 deaths (68%) and 2 leukemic 
transformations  (8%)  were  documented.  In  multivariable  analysis, 
advanced  age,  low  hemoglobin,  and  TET2  mutations  were  shown  to 
carry independent prognostic significance; other mutations, including 
ASXL1  and  SETBP1,  lacked  prognostic  significance.  Conventional 
chemotherapy  is  largely  ineffective  in  the  treatment  of  aCML.  Simi-
larly,  treatment  response  to  the  JAK1/2  inhibitor  ruxolitinib  has  not 
been  impressive.  However,  a  favorable  experience  with  autologous 
stem cell transplantation (ASCT) was reported in nine patients; after a 
median follow-up of 55 months, the majority of the patients remained 
in complete remission.

 ■ CHRONIC MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA
CMML  is  classified  under  the  WHO  category  of  MDS/MPN  and  is 
defined by an absolute monocyte count (AMC) of ≥1 × 109/L in the PB 
and accounting for ≥10% of the leukocyte count. Median age at diag-
nosis ranges from 65 to 75 years, and there is a 2:1 male predominance.

Clinical presentation is variable and depends on whether the disease 
presents  with  MDS-like  or  MPN-like  phenotype;  the  former  is  asso-
ciated with cytopenias and the latter with splenomegaly and features 
of  myeloproliferation  such  as  fatigue,  night  sweats,  weight  loss,  and 
cachexia.  About  20%  of  patients  with  CMML  experience  serositis 
involving the joints (arthritis), pericardium (pericarditis and pericar-
dial effusion), pleura (pleural effusion), or peritoneum (ascites).

Pathogenesis  Almost  all  patients  with  CMML  harbor  somatic 
mutations  involving  epigenetic  regulator  genes  (e.g.,  ASXL1,  TET2), 
spliceosome pathway genes (e.g., SRSF2), DNA damage response genes 
(e.g.,  TP53),  and  tyrosine  kinases/transcription  factors  (e.g.,  KRAS, 
NRAS, CBL, and RUNX1). However, none of these mutations are spe-
cific to CMML, and their precise pathogenetic contribution is unclear. 
Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in about a third of patients 
with CMML and include trisomy 8 and abnormalities of chromosome 
7. More recent studies have demonstrated the presence of BM dendritic 
cell aggregates suggesting systemic immune dysregulation and distinct 
phenotypic features of monocytes in CMML.

Diagnosis  Reactive  monocytosis  is  uncommon  but  has  been 
reported in association with certain infections and inflammatory con-
ditions. Clonal (i.e., neoplastic) monocytosis defines CMML but is also 
seen with JMML and AML with monocytic differentiation. The WHO 
diagnostic criteria for CMML are listed in Table 110-5 and include per-
sistent PB monocyte count of ≥1 × 109/L with monocyte percentage of 
≥10%; absence of BCR-ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, or PCM1-
JAK2 rearrangements; not meeting WHO criteria for CML, PV, ET, or 
PMF; <20% blasts and promonocytes in the PB and BM; and dysplasia 
involving one or more myeloid lineages or, in the absence of dysplasia, 
presence of an acquired clonal cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnor-
mality or nonreactive monocytosis lasting for at least 3 months.

The BM in CMML is hypercellular with granulocytic and monocytic 
proliferation.  Dysplasia  is  often  present  and  may  involve  one,  two, 
or  all  myeloid  lineages.  On  immunophenotyping,  the  abnormal  cells 
often express myelomonocytic antigens such as CD13 and CD33, with 
variable  expression  of  CD14,  CD68,  CD64,  and  CD163.  Monocytic- 
derived  cells  are  almost  always  positive  for  the  cytochemical  non-
specific  esterases  (e.g.,  butyrate  esterase),  while  normal  granulocytic 
precursors  are  positive  for  lysozyme  and  chloroacetate  esterase.  In 
CMML, it is common to have a hybrid cytochemical staining pattern 
with cells expressing both chloroacetate and butyrate esterases simul-
taneously (dual esterase staining). Monocytosis can be associated with 
reactive as well as other myeloid neoplasms. Based on flow cytometric 
expression of CD14/CD16, monocytes can be classified into classical 
MO1  (CD14+/CD16–),  intermediate  MO2  (CD14+/CD16+),  and 
nonclassical MO3 (CD14−/CD16+) fractions, with MO1 constituting 
the  major  monocyte  population  (85%)  in  healthy  conditions.  Recent 
studies have suggested characteristic increase in classical monocytes in 
CMML patients, distinguishing them from other causes of reactive and 
clonal monocytosis.

Prognosis  A  recent  meta-analysis  showed  median  survival  of  
1.5 years in CMML. Numerous prognostic systems have attempted to 
better define and stratify the natural history of CMML. One of these, 
the  Mayo  prognostic  model,  assigns  one  point  each  to  the  following 
four independent prognostic variables: AMC >10 × 109/L, presence of 
circulating  immature  cells,  hemoglobin  <10  g/dL,  and  platelet  count 
<100,000/mL. This model stratified patients into three risk groups: low 
(0  points),  intermediate  (1  point),  and  high  (≥2  points),  translating 
to  median  survival  of  32,  18,  and  10  months,  respectively.  Another 
prognostic model referred to as the CMML-specific prognostic scoring 
system  (CPSS)  identified  four  variables  as  being  prognostic  for  both 
overall survival and leukemia-free survival: French-American-British 
(FAB) and WHO CMML subtypes, red blood cell transfusion depen-
dency, and the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system. A French 
study  incorporated  ASXL1  mutational  status  in  312  CMML  patients; 
in  a  multivariable  model,  independent  predictors  of  poor  survival 
were  WBC  >15  ×  109/L  (3  points),  ASXL1  mutations  (2  points),  age 
>65  years  (2  points),  platelet  count  <100,000/mL  (2  points),  and 

hemoglobin  <10  g/dL  in  females  and  <11  g/dL  in  males  (2  points). 
This  model  stratified  patients  into  three  groups:  low  (0–4  points), 
intermediate  (5–7  points),  and  high  risk  (8–12  points),  with  median 
survivals of not reached and 38.5 and 14.4 months, respectively. More 
recent studies have highlighted the adverse prognostic effect of ASXL1 
and DNMT3A mutations in CMML. To further clarify the prognostic 
relevance  of  ASXL1  mutations,  an  international  collaborative  cohort 
of 466 CMML patients was analyzed. In multivariable analysis, ASXL1 
mutations, AMC >10 × 109/L, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, platelets <100 ×  
109/L,  and  circulating  immature  myeloid  cells  were  independently 
predictive of shortened overall survival. More recently, the aforemen-
tioned  CPSS  model  was  updated  to  include  molecular  abnormalities 
including  ASXL1,  RUNX1,  NRAS,  and  SETBP1  mutations  (CPSS-
Mol). In a report of 171 patients with blast phase CMML (median age  
71 years), treatment included best supportive care in 25%, hypometh-
ylating  agent  therapy  in  10%,  AML-like  induction  chemotherapy  in 
38%, AML-like induction chemotherapy followed by AHSCT in 15%, 
upfront AHSCT in 2%, and clinical trials in 11%. After a median follow- 
up  of  4.4  months,  141  deaths  (82%)  were  recorded.  Median  overall 
survival was 6 months with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 25%, 9%, 
and 6%, respectively.

Treatment  Current  treatment  in  CMML  consists  of  hydroxyurea 
and  supportive  care,  including  red  cell  transfusions  and  use  of  
erythropoiesis-stimulating  agents  (ESAs).  The  value  of  hydroxyurea 
was  reinforced  by  a  randomized  trial  against  oral  etoposide.  No 
other  single  or  combination  chemotherapy  has  been  shown  to  be 
superior  to  hydroxyurea.  AHSCT  is  a  viable  treatment  option  for 
transplant-eligible  patients  with  poor  prognostic  features.  Given  the 
MDS/MPN overlap phenotype and the presence of MDS-like genetic/
methylation abnormalities in CMML, hypomethylating agents such as 
5-azacitidine and decitabine have been used with limited efficacy; in 
a  recent  study  using  decitabine  in  CMML,  overall  response  rate  was 
48% with 17% complete remissions and median survival of 17 months. 
The experience with 5-azacytidine was somewhat similar. In a recent 
Mayo  Clinic  report,  among  406  consecutive  CMML  patients  (age  
≤75  years  at  diagnosis)  seen  between  January  1990  and  December 
2018,  70  (17%)  underwent  AHSCT  (median  age  58  years)  including 
46 (66%) in chronic phase and 24 (34%) in blast phase. At a median  
follow-up  of  70  months,  there  were  22  deaths  (31%)  in  the  chronic 
phase  transplant  group,  11  (24%)  from  disease  relapse  and  9  (20%) 
from  nonrelapse  mortality.  Posttransplant  median  survival  was  
67  months  in  the  chronic  phase  and  16  months  in  the  blast  phase 
(p  <.01)  transplant  groups;  5-year  survival  rates  were  51%  and  19%, 
respectively.

 ■ JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA
JMML is primarily a disease of early childhood and is included, along 
with  CMML,  in  the  MDS/MPN  WHO  category.  Both  CMML  and 
JMML  feature  leukocytosis,  monocytosis,  and  hepatosplenomegaly. 
Additional  characteristic  features  in  JMML  include  thrombocytope-
nia  and  elevated  fetal  hemoglobin.  Myeloid  progenitors  in  JMML 
display granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 
hypersensitivity that has been attributed to dysregulated RAS/MAPK 
signaling.  The  latter  is  believed  to  result  from  mutually  exclusive 
mutations involving RAS, PTPN11, and NF1. A third of patients with 
JMML  that  is  not  associated  with  Noonan  syndrome  carry  PTPN11 
mutations, whereas the incidence of NF1 in patients without neurofi-
bromatosis type 1 (NF1) and RAS mutations is ~15% each. In general, 
~85% of JMML cases have one of the classical RAS pathway mutations 
(PTPN11, NRAS, KRAS, NF1, or CBL); in addition, a myriad of other 
mutations,  such  as  ASXL1,  RUNX1,  SETBP1,  JAK3,  and  CUX1,  have 
recently been reported. Drug therapy is relatively ineffective in JMML, 
and the treatment of choice is AHSCT, which results in a 5-year sur-
vival of approximately 50%.

The  2016  revised  WHO  diagnostic  criteria  for  JMML  require  the 
presence of PB monocyte count ≥1 × 109/L, <20% blasts in blood or 
BM, splenomegaly, and absence of BCR-ABL1. Diagnosis also requires 
the  presence  of  one  of  the  following:  somatic  mutation  of  PTPN11, 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   861

862 KRAS, or NRAS; clinical diagnosis of NF1 or NF1 mutation; germline 
mutation of CBL; and loss of heterozygosity. Diagnosis of JMML can 
still be considered without the aforementioned genetic features in the 
presence of monosomy 7 or any other cytogenetic abnormality or in 
the presence of two of the following: increased hemoglobin F, presence 
of myeloid or erythroid precursors in the PB, GM-CSF hypersensitivity 
in colony assay, and hyperphosphorylation of STAT5.

 ■ MDS/MPN, UNCLASSIFIABLE (MDS/MPN-U)
The WHO classifies patients with morphologic and laboratory features 
that resemble both MDS and MPN as “MDS/MPN overlap.” This cat-
egory includes CMML, aCML, and JMML, which have been discussed 
above.  In  addition,  MDS/MPN  includes  a  fourth  category  referred 
to  as  MDS/MPN,  unclassifiable  (MDS/MPN-U).  Diagnosis  of  MDS/
MPN-U requires the presence of both MDS and MPN features that are 
not  adequate  to  classify  patients  as  CMML,  aCML,  or  JMML.  MDS/
MPN also includes the provisional category of refractory anemia with 
ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T); the 2016 revision of 
the  WHO  classification  document  has  changed  the  term  RARS-T  to 
MDS/MPN-RS-T.

In a representative study of 85 patients with MDS/MPN-U, median 
age  was  70  years  and  72%  were  male.  Splenomegaly  at  presentation 
was  present  in  33%,  thrombocytosis  in  13%,  leukocytosis  in  18%, 
JAK2  mutations  in  30%,  and  abnormal  karyotype  in  51%;  the  most 
frequent cytogenetic abnormality was trisomy 8. Median survival was 
12.4  months  and  favorably  affected  by  thrombocytosis.  Treatment 
with hypomethylating agents, immunomodulators, or AHSCT did not 
appear to favorably affect survival.

 ■ MDS/MPN WITH RING SIDEROBLASTS AND 
THROMBOCYTOSIS (MDS/MPN-RS-T)
MDS/MPN-RS-T  is  classified  in  the  MDS/MPN  category  because  it 
shares dysplastic features with MDS-RS and myeloproliferative features 
with  ET.  The  2016  revised  WHO  diagnostic  criteria  for  MDS/MPN-
RS-T  includes  anemia  associated  with  erythroid  lineage  dysplasia, 
presence  of  ≥15%  ring  sideroblasts,  blast  count  of  <5%  in  BM  and 
<1%  in  the  PB,  platelet  count  of  ≥450  ×  109/L,  and  absence  of  BCR-
ABL1, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, or PCM1-JAK2 mutations or t(3;3)
(q21;q26),  inv(3)(q21q26),  or  del(5q).  These  new  diagnostic  criteria 
also  require  the  absence  of  history  of  MPN,  MDS,  or  other  type  of 
MDS/MPN and also either the presence of SF3B1 mutation or absence 
of exposure to cytotoxic or other treatment that could be blamed for 
the morphologic abnormalities.

  In  a  recent  study,  111  patients  with  MDS/MPN-RS-T  were  com-
pared with 33 patients with RARS. The frequency of SF3B1 mutations 
in  MDS/MPN-RS-T-T  (87%)  was  similar  to  that  in  MDS-RS  (85%). 
JAK2  V617F  mutation  was  detected  in  49%  of  MDS/MPN-RS-T 
patients (including 48% of those mutated for SF3B1) but none of those 
with MDS-RS. In MDS/MPN-RS-T, SF3B1 mutations were more fre-
quent in females (95%) than in males (77%), and mean ring sideroblast 
counts were higher in SF3B1-mutated patients. Median overall survival 
was  6.9  years  in  SF3B1  mutated  cases  versus  3.3  years  in  unmutated 
cases.  Six-year  survival  was  67%  in  JAK2  mutated  cases  versus  32% 
in unmutated cases. Multivariable analysis identified younger age and 
JAK2  and  SF3B1  mutations  as  favorable  factors.  Predictors  of  poor 
survival  in  MDS/MPN-RS-T  include  anemia,  abnormal  karyotype, 
and presence of ASXL1 or SETBP1 mutations. Interestingly, the pres-
ence of SF3B1 mutations in MDS/MPN-RS-T was recently shown to 
be  associated  with  increased  risk  of  thrombosis.  Several  case  reports 
have  suggested  that  treatment  with  lenalidomide  might  induce  red 
cell  transfusion  independency  and  complete  remissions  in  MDS/
MPN-RS-T. Most recently, luspatercept, a recombinant fusion protein 
that binds transforming growth factor β superfamily ligands to reduce 
SMAD  signaling,  has  also  been  shown  to  benefit  some  patients  with 
MDS-RS-T; in a recently published phase 3 trial involving 229 patients 
with transfusion-dependent very-low- to intermediate-risk MDS-RS-T, 
transfusion  independence  for  ≥8  weeks  was  achieved  in  38%  of  the 
patients  receiving  luspatercept  versus  13%  of  patients  in  the  placebo 
group (p <.01).

 ■ MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASM, 
UNCLASSIFIABLE (MPN-U)
The  category  of  MPN-U  includes  MPN-like  neoplasms  that  cannot 
be  clearly  classified  as  one  of  the  other  seven  subcategories  of  MPN  
(Table  110-4).  Examples  include  patients  presenting  with  unusual 
thrombosis  or  unexplained  organomegaly  with  normal  blood  counts 
but  found  to  carry  MPN-characteristic  mutations  such  as  JAK2  and 
CALR  or  display  BM  morphology  that  is  consistent  with  MPN.  It  is 
possible that some cases of MPN-U represent earlier disease stages in 
PV or ET, which however fail to meet the threshold hemoglobin levels 
or platelet counts that are required per WHO diagnostic criteria. Spe-
cific treatment interventions might not be necessary in asymptomatic 
patients with MPN-U, whereas patients with arterial thrombotic com-
plications might require cytoreductive and aspirin therapy and those 
with venous thrombosis might require systemic anticoagulation.

 ■ MYELOID NEOPLASMS WITH GERMLINE 
PREDISPOSITION
The  2016  WHO  revision  on  the  classification  of  myeloid  neoplasms 
added a section referred to as “myeloid neoplasms with germline pre-
disposition”  and  that  includes  cases  of  AML,  MDS,  and  MDS/MPN 
that arise in the setting of a germline predisposition mutation, such as 
CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6, or GATA2. This particular 
category of diseases also includes myeloid neoplasms that arise in the 
background of BM failure syndromes, Down syndrome, Noonan syn-
drome, neurofibromatosis, and telomeropathies.
 ■ TRANSIENT MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER 
(TMD)
TMD,  also  referred  to  as  transient  abnormal  myelopoiesis  (TAM), 
constitutes  an  often  but  not  always  transient  phenomenon  of  abnor-
mal  megakaryoblast  proliferation,  which  occurs  in  ~10%  of  infants 
with Down syndrome. TMD is usually recognized at birth and either 
undergoes  spontaneous  regression  (75%  of  cases)  or  progresses  to 
acute  megakaryoblastic  leukemia  (AMKL)  (25%  of  cases).  Almost  all 
patients with TMD and TMD-derived AMKL display somatic GATA1 
mutations. TMD-associated GATA1 mutations constitute exon 2 inser-
tions, deletions, or missense mutations, affecting the N-terminal trans-
activation domain of GATA-1, and result in loss of full-length (50-kD) 
GATA-1 and its replacement with a shorter isoform (40-kD) that retains 
friend  of  GATA-1  (FOG-1)  binding.  In  contrast,  inherited  forms  of 
exon 2 GATA1 mutations produce a phenotype with anemia, whereas 
exon 4 mutations that affect the N-terminal, FOG-1-interactive domain 
produce familial dyserythropoietic anemia with thrombocytopenia or 
X-linked macrothrombocytopenia.
 ■ PRIMARY EOSINOPHILIA
Eosinophilia  refers  to  a  PB  absolute  eosinophil  count  (AEC)  that  is 
above the upper normal limit of the reference range. The term hyper-
eosinophilia  is  used  when  the  AEC  is  >1500  ×  109/L.  Eosinophilia  is 
operationally  classified  into  secondary  (nonneoplastic  proliferation 
of eosinophils) and primary (proliferation of eosinophils that is either 
neoplastic  or  otherwise  unexplained).  Secondary  eosinophilia  is  by 
far  the  most  frequent  cause  of  eosinophilia  and  is  often  associated 
with  infections,  especially  those  related  to  tissue-invasive  helminths, 
allergic/vasculitic diseases, drugs, and metastatic cancer. Primary eos-
inophilia is the focus of this chapter and is considered when a cause for 
secondary eosinophilia is not readily apparent.

Primary eosinophilia is classified as clonal or idiopathic. Diagnosis 
of clonal eosinophilia requires morphologic, cytogenetic, or molecular 
evidence of a myeloid neoplasm. Idiopathic eosinophilia is considered 
when both secondary and clonal eosinophilias have been ruled out as 
a possibility. HES is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia with per-
sistent AEC of ≥1.5 × 109/L and associated with eosinophil-mediated 
organ damage (Table 110-6). An HES-like disorder that is associated 
with clonal or phenotypically abnormal T cells is referred to as lympho-
cytic variant hypereosinophilia (Table 110-6).

Clonal Eosinophilia  Examples of clonal eosinophilia include eos-
inophilia associated with AML, MDS, CML, mastocytosis, and MDS/

MPN overlap. Myeloid neoplasm–associated eosinophilia also includes 
the  WHO  MPN  subcategory  of  chronic  eosinophilic  leukemia,  not 
otherwise  specified  (CEL-NOS)  and  the  WHO  myeloid  malignancy 
subcategory  referred  to  as  myeloid/lymphoid  neoplasms  with  eosin-
ophilia  and  rearrangement  of  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptor 
(PDGFR) α/β or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) or with 
PCM1-JAK2 (Table 110-4).

The  diagnostic  workup  for  clonal  eosinophilia  that  is  not  associ-
ated  with  morphologically  overt  myeloid  malignancy  should  start 
with  PB  mutation  screening  for  FIP1L1-PDGFRA  and  PDGFRB 
mutations  using  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH)  or  reverse 
transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction.  This  is  crucial  since  such 
eosinophilia  is  easily  treated  with  imatinib.  If  mutation  screening  is 
negative,  a  BM  examination  with  cytogenetic  studies  is  indicated.  In 
this  regard,  one  must  first  pay  attention  to  the  presence  or  absence 
of  5q33,  4q12,  8p11.2,  or  t(8;9)(p22;p24.1)  translocations,  which,  if 
present, would suggest PDGFRB-, PDGFRA-, or FGFR1-rearranged or 
PCM1-JAK2-associated clonal eosinophilia, respectively. The presence 
of 5q33 or 4q12 translocations predicts favorable response to treatment 
with  imatinib  mesylate  and  presence  of  t(8;9)(p22;p24.1)  predicts  a 
transient  response  to  ruxolitinib,  whereas  8p11.2  translocations  are 
associated with aggressive myeloid malignancies that are refractory to 
current drug therapy.

Chronic  Eosinophilic  Leukemia,  Not  Otherwise  Specified 
(CEL-NOS)  CEL-NOS  is  a  subset  of  clonal  eosinophilia  that  is 
neither  molecularly  defined  nor  classified  as  an  alternative  clinico-
pathologically assigned myeloid malignancy. We prefer to use the term 
strictly  in  patients  with  an  HES  phenotype  who  also  display  either  a 
clonal cytogenetic/molecular abnormality or excess blasts in the BM or 
PB. The WHO defines CEL-NOS as the presence of ≥1.5 × 109/L AEC 
that is accompanied by either the presence of myeloblast excess (either 
>2% in the PB or 5–19% in the BM) or evidence of myeloid clonality.
In  a  recent  Mayo  Clinic  survey  of  1416  patients  with  PB  eosino-
philia  evaluated  between  2008  and  2019,  17  patients  (1.2%)  fulfilled 
the WHO 2016 criteria for CEL-NOS. Median age was 63 years (range 
25–92 years) with the vast majority of patients (88%) presenting with 
systemic symptoms. Organ involvement was a prominent feature, and 
involved organs included spleen, cardiac and pulmonary organs, and 
distal esophagus. Laboratory abnormalities included anemia, leukocy-
tosis, and eosinophilia (median eosinophil count of 6.4 × 109/L; range 
2.0–53.1).  The  most  common  BM  abnormalities  included  abnormal 
eosinophils,  abnormal  and  increased  megakaryocytes,  and  fibrosis 
(18%).  Cytogenetic  abnormalities  occurred  in  88%  of  patients  and 
included trisomy 8, complex karyotype, 13q–, 20q–, and chromosome 
1  abnormalities.  All  seven  patients  with  next-generation  sequencing 
studies harbored one or more mutations, including ASXL1 (43%) and 
IDH1 (29%). Half of patients treated with hydroxyurea-based regimens 
responded with a persistent decline in eosinophil count for a median 
duration of 18 months. One-third of patients treated with prednisone 
responded, with a median duration of response of 13 months. Three 

patients  were  treated  with  imatinib,  of  whom  two  had  normaliza-
tion  of  eosinophil  count.  At  a  median  follow-up  of  13  months,  nine 
patients  had  died  including  three  patients  who  underwent  leukemic 
transformation.

PDGFR Mutated Eosinophilia  Both platelet-derived growth factor 
receptors α (PDGFRA located on chromosome 4q12) and β (PDGFRB 
located  on  chromosome  5q31-q32)  are  involved  in  MPN-relevant 
activating  mutations.  Clinical  phenotype  in  both  instances  includes 
prominent  blood  eosinophilia  and  excellent  response  to  imatinib 
therapy. In regard to PDGFRA mutations, the most popular is FIP1L1- 
PDGFRA,  a  karyotypically  occult  del(4)(q12),  that  was  described  in 
2003  as  an  imatinib-sensitive  activating  mutation.  Functional  stud-
ies  have  demonstrated  transforming  properties  in  cell  lines  and  the 
induction  of  MPN  in  mice.  Cloning  of  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRA  fusion 
gene identified a novel molecular mechanism for generating this con-
stitutively active fusion tyrosine kinase, wherein a ~800-kb interstitial 
deletion within 4q12 fuses the 5′ portion of FIP1L1 to the 3′ portion 
of PDGFRA. FIP1L1-PDGFRA occurs in a very small subset of patients 
who present with the phenotypic features of either systemic mastocy-
tosis (SM) or HES, but the presence of the mutation reliably predicts 
complete hematologic and molecular response to imatinib therapy.

In  a  recent  retrospective  survey  of  151  patients  with  FIP1L1- 
PDGFRA–associated  eosinophilia  (143  males;  mean  age  at  diagnosis  
49  years),  organopathy  involved  the  spleen  (44%),  skin  (32%),  lungs 
(30%),  heart  (19%),  and  central  nervous  system  (9%);  none  of  31 
patients initially treated with corticosteroids achieved complete hemato-
logic remission, whereas all 148 patients treated with imatinib achieved 
complete hematologic responses and also molecular responses, when 
evaluated. Treatment discontinuation was documented in 46 patients 
followed by a 57% relapse rate; the 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival 
rates  in  imatinib-treated  patients  were  99%,  95%,  and  84%,  respec-
tively.  Other  studies  have  confirmed  the  possibility  of  treatment-free 
remissions in some patients after imatinib discontinuation. Infrequent 
occurrence of FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutated acute myeloid leukemia asso-
ciated with eosinophilia has also been shown to respond to low-dose 
imatinib therapy (100 mg/d).

The  association  between  eosinophilic  myeloid  malignancies  and 
PDGFRB rearrangement was first characterized and published in 1994 
where fusion of the tyrosine kinase encoding region of PDGFRB to the 
ets-like  gene  ETV6  (ETV6-PDGFRB,  t[5;12][q33;p13])  was  demon-
strated. The fusion protein was transforming to cell lines and resulted 
in  constitutive  activation  of  PDGFRB  signaling.  Since  then,  several 
other  PDGFRB  fusion  transcripts  with  similar  disease  phenotypes 
have been described, and cell line transformation and MPD induction 
in  mice  have  been  demonstrated.  Imatinib  therapy  was  shown  to  be 
effective when employed.

FGFR1 Mutated Eosinophilia  The 8p11 myeloproliferative syn-
drome  (EMS)  (also  known  as  human  stem  cell  leukemic/lymphoma 
syndrome)  constitutes  a  clinical  phenotype  with  features  of  both 
lymphoma  and  eosinophilic  MPN  and  is  characterized  by  a  fusion 

HPIM21e_Part4_p481-p940.indd   863

864 mutation that involves the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 
(FGFR1), which is located on chromosome 8p11. In EMS, both mye-
loid  and  lymphoid  lineage  cells  exhibit  the  8p11  translocation,  thus 
demonstrating the stem cell origin of the disease. The disease features 
several 8p11-linked chromosome translocations, and some of the cor-
responding fusion FGFR1 mutants have been shown to transform cell 
lines and induce EMS- or CML-like disease in mice depending on the 
specific FGFR1 partner gene (ZNF198 or  BCR, respectively). Consis-
tent with this laboratory observation, some patients with BCR-FGFR1 
mutation manifest a more indolent CML-like disease. The mechanism 
of  FGFR1  activation  in  EMS  is  similar  to  that  seen  with  PDGFRB- 
associated MPD; the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 is juxtaposed to 
a dimerization domain from the partner gene. EMS is aggressive and 
requires combination chemotherapy followed by ASCT.
PCM1-JAK2–Associated  Myeloid/Lymphoid  Neoplasm  with 
Eosinophilia  The  2016  revised  WHO  document  includes  a  pro-
visional  entity  under  myeloid/lymphoid  neoplasms  with  eosinophilia 
referred  to  as  “myeloid/lymphoid  neoplasms  with  PCM1-JAK2.”  The 
entity  is  characterized  by  the  t(8;9)(p22;p24.1)  cytogenetic  abnor-
mality  and  a  phenotype  that  displays  marked  male  predominance, 
hepatosplenomegaly,  eosinophilia,  and  morphologic  features  similar 
to MPN, MDS, or MDS/MPN. Current drug therapy for PCM1-JAK2–
associated disease is suboptimal, although some affected patients have 
displayed transient responses to ruxolitinib therapy.
Hypereosinophilic Syndrome  Blood eosinophilia that is neither 
secondary nor clonal is operationally labeled as being “idiopathic.” HES 
is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia with persistent increase of 
the AEC to ≥1.5 × 109/L and presence of eosinophil-mediated organ 
damage, including cardiomyopathy, gastroenteritis, cutaneous lesions, 
sinusitis,  pneumonitis,  neuritis,  and  vasculitis.  In  addition,  some 
patients  manifest  thromboembolic  complications,  hepatosplenomeg-
aly, and either cytopenia or cytosis.

BM histologic and cytogenetic/molecular studies should be exam-
ined  before  a  working  diagnosis  of  HES  is  made.  Additional  blood 
studies  that  are  currently  recommended  during  the  evaluation  of 
HES include serum tryptase (an increased level suggests mastocytosis 
and  warrants  molecular  studies  to  detect  FIP1L1-PDGFRA),  T-cell 
immunophenotyping, and T-cell receptor antigen gene rearrangement 
analysis (a positive test suggests an underlying clonal or phenotypically 
abnormal T-cell disorder). In addition, initial evaluation in HES should 
include echocardiogram and measurement of serum troponin levels to 
screen for myocardial involvement by the disease.

Initial  evaluation  of  the  patient  with  eosinophilia  should  include 
tests  that  facilitate  assessment  of  target  organ  damage:  complete 
blood count, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, and serum troponin level. 
Increased level of serum cardiac troponin has been shown to correlate 
with  the  presence  of  cardiomyopathy  in  HES.  Typical  echocardio-
graphic findings in HES include ventricular apical thrombus, posterior 
mitral  leaflet  or  tricuspid  valve  abnormality,  endocardial  thickening, 
dilated left ventricle, and pericardial effusion.

In a recent Mayo Clinic study of 98 consecutive patients with idio-
pathic  eosinophilia,  including  HES,  median  age  was  53  years  (55% 
males)  and  overt  organ  involvement  was  seen  in  >80%  of  the  cases, 
including 54% involving organs other than the skin. The frequencies 
of  cardiac  involvement,  hepatosplenomegaly,  and  increased  serum 
tryptase  and  interleukin  5  (IL-5)  levels  were  8%,  4%,  24%,  and  31%, 
respectively. The study also revealed that 11% of the affected patients 
harbored  pathogenetic  mutations  including  TET2,  ASXL1,  and  KIT; 
the presence of such mutations did not appear to influence phenotype, 
and the number of informative cases was too small to assess prognostic 
relevance. Instead, the study identified anemia and presence of cardiac 
involvement or hepatosplenomegaly as risk factors for survival.

Corticosteroids  are  the  cornerstone  of  therapy  in  HES.  Treatment 
with  oral  prednisone  is  usually  started  at  1  mg/kg/d  and  continued 
for  1–2  weeks  before  the  dose  is  tapered  slowly  over  the  ensuing  
2–3 months. If symptoms recur at a prednisone dose level of >10 mg/d, 
either hydroxyurea or interferon α is used as a steroid-sparing agent. 
In  patients  who  fail  usual  therapy  as  outlined  above,  mepolizumab 

or alemtuzumab might be considered. Mepolizumab is a monoclonal 
antibody  that  targets  IL-5,  which  is  a  well-recognized  survival  factor 
for  eosinophils.  Alemtuzumab  targets  the  CD52  antigen,  which  has 
been shown to be expressed by eosinophils but not by neutrophils. In 
a  recently  reported,  placebo-controlled,  phase  3  study,  HES  patients 
received subcutaneous mepolizumab (300 mg) every 4 weeks, in addi-
tion to their preprotocol therapy, and experienced significantly fewer 
disease flare ups or treatment discontinuations (28 vs 56% for placebo), 
without excess adverse events. Mepolizumab was approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in HES on September 
25, 2020. In a smaller phase 2 study, benralizumab (monoclonal anti-
body targeting the receptor for IL-5; 30 mg given subcutaneously every 
4 weeks) was also shown to reduce eosinophil count more efficiently 
compared to placebo (90 vs 30%).

 ■ MASTOCYTOSIS
Mast  cell  disease  (MCD)  is  defined  as  tissue  infiltration  by  morpho-
logically  and  immunophenotypically  abnormal  mast  cells.  MCD  is 
classified into two broad categories: cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and 
systemic mastocytosis (SM). MCD in adults is usually systemic, and the 
clinical course can be either indolent or aggressive, depending on the 
respective absence or presence of impaired organ function. Symptoms 
and  signs  of  MCD  include  urticaria  pigmentosa,  mast  cell  mediator 
release symptoms (e.g., headache, flushing, lightheadedness, syncope, 
anaphylaxis, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, nausea, diarrhea, abdom-
inal  cramps),  and  organ  damage  (lytic  bone  lesions,  osteoporosis, 
hepatosplenomegaly,  cytopenia).  Aggressive  SM  can  be  associated 
with  another  myeloid  malignancy,  including  MPN,  MDS,  or  MDS/
MPN overlap (e.g., CMML), or present as overt mast cell leukemia. In 
general, life expectancy is near normal in indolent SM but significantly 
shortened in aggressive SM.

Diagnosis  of  SM  is  based  on  BM  examination  that  shows  clusters 
of morphologically abnormal, spindle-shaped mast cells that are best 
evaluated by the use of immunohistochemical stains that are specific to 
mast cells (tryptase, CD117). In addition, mast cell immunophenotyp-
ing reveals aberrant CD25 expression by neoplastic mast cells. Other 
laboratory findings in SM include increased levels of serum tryptase, 
histamine  and  urine  histamine  metabolites,  and  prostaglandins.  SM 
is associated with KIT mutations, usually KIT D816V, in the majority 
of  patients.  Accordingly,  mutation  screening  for  KIT  D816V  is  diag-
nostically  useful.  However,  the  ability  to  detect  KIT  D816V  depends 
on assay sensitivity and mast cell content of the test sample. The 2016 
WHO classification of mastocytosis includes (1) CM, (2) SM, and (3) 
mast cell sarcoma (MCS). SM is further classified into (1) indolent SM 
(ISM), (2) smoldering SM (SSM), (3) SM with an associated hemato-
logic neoplasm (SM-AHN), (4) aggressive SM (ASM), and (5) mast cell 
leukemia (MCL).

In a recent Mayo Clinic study of 580 patients (median age 55 years; 
range 18–88 years) with SM, morphologic subcategories were indolent/
smoldering in 291 patients (50%) and advanced in 289 patients (50%), 
including SM-AHN in 199, ASM in 85, and MCL in 5. Multivariable 
analysis  of  clinical  variables  identified  age  >60  years,  advanced  SM, 
thrombocytopenia  <150  ×  109/L,  anemia  below  sex-adjusted  normal, 
and  increased  alkaline  phosphatase  as  independent  risk  factors  for 
survival. In addition, ASXL1, RUNX1, and NRAS mutations were also 
independently  associated  with  inferior  survival.  Combined  clinical, 
cytogenetic,  and  molecular  risk  factor  analysis  confirmed  the  inde-
pendent prognostic contribution of adverse mutations, advanced SM, 
thrombocytopenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and age >60 years. 
These  data  were  subsequently  used  to  develop  clinical  and  hybrid 
clinical-molecular risk models. The clinical risk model uses six readily 
accessible risk variables including age >60 years, platelet count <150 ×  
109/L,  anemia,  hypoalbuminemia,  increased  alkaline  phosphatase, 
and morphologic classification as advanced SM. Accordingly, median 
survival times were not reached, 148, 65, 31, 18, and 5 months in the 
presence of ≤1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of these risk factors, respectively.

Both  ISM  and  ASM  patients  might  experience  mast  cell  mediator 
release  symptoms,  which  are  usually  managed  by  both  H1  and  H2 
histamine  receptor  blockers  as  well  as  cromolyn  sodium.  In  addition,

patients with propensity to vasodilatory shock should wear a medical 
alert bracelet and carry an Epi-Pen self-injector for self-administration 
of  subcutaneous  epinephrine.  Urticaria  pigmentosa  shows  variable 
response to both topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy. Cytore-
ductive  therapy  is  not  recommended  for  ISM,  and  instead,  such 
patients  are  managed  with  use  of  H1  and  H2  blockers,  leukotriene 
antagonists,  sodium  cromolyn,  phototherapy,  topical  steroids,  and 
osteoporosis  prevention  with  diphosphonates  including  alendronate 
and pamidronate. In ASM, either interferon α or cladribine is consid-
ered first-line therapy and benefits the majority of patients. Cladribine 
is  administered  by  2-h  infusion  (5  mg/m2)  daily  for  5  days,  repeated 
monthly for 4–6 cycles; expected overall response is ~ 50%, including 
major  response  in  ~38%.  In  contrast,  imatinib  is  ineffective  in  the 
treatment  of  PDGFR  unmutated  SM.  A  controlled  study  of  patients 
with  ISM  or  SSM  demonstrated  marginal  value  of  masitinib  (oral 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits KIT and LYN), with a reported 
cumulative  symptomatic  response  rate  of  18.7%  versus  7.4%  for  pla-
cebo.  Treatment  responses  were  more  impressive  in  another  study 
that  used  the  multikinase  inhibitor  midostaurin  in  patients  with  the 
more aggressive forms of SM, with 45% of the patients achieving major 
response. Most recently, equally impressive responses were seen with 
the use of another kinase inhibitor, avapritinib (specifically targets KIT 
D816V), in both ISM and ASM; however, significant drug-related tox-
icity, including intracranial bleed, cognitive impairment, and moderate 
to severe cytopenias, has been observed.
 ■ DENDRITIC AND HISTIOCYTIC NEOPLASMS
Dendritic  cell  (DC)  and  histiocyte/macrophage  neoplasms  are 
extremely rare. DCs are antigen-presenting cells, whereas histiocytes/
macrophages are antigen-processing. BM myeloid stem cells (CD34+) 
give  rise  to  monocyte  (CD14+,  CD68+,  CD11c+,  CD1a–)  and  DC 
(CD14–,  CD11c+/–,  CD1a+/–)  precursors.  Monocyte  precursors,  in 
turn,  give  rise  to  macrophages  (CD14+,  CD68+,  CD11c+,  CD163+, 
lysozyme+)  and  interstitial  DCs  (CD68+,  CD1a–).  DC  precursors 
give  rise  to  Langerhans  cell  DCs  (Birbeck  granules,  CD1a+,  S100+, 
langerin+) and plasmacytoid DCs (CD68+, CD123+). Follicular DCs 
(CD21+,  CD23+,  CD35+)  originate  from  mesenchymal  stem  cells. 
Dendritic  and  histiocytic  neoplasms  are  operationally  classified  into 
macrophage/histiocyte-related  and  DC-related.  The  former  includes 
histiocytic  sarcoma/malignant  histiocytosis,  and  the  latter  includes 
Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Langerhans cell sarcoma, interdigitating 
DC sarcoma, and follicular DC sarcoma.

Histiocytic  Sarcoma/Malignant  Histiocytosis  Histiocytic 
sarcoma represents malignant proliferation of mature tissue histiocytes 
and is often localized. Median age at diagnosis is estimated at 46 years 
with slight male predilection. Some patients might have history of lym-
phoma, MDS, or germ cell tumors at time of disease presentation. The 
three typical disease sites are lymph nodes, skin, and gastrointestinal 
system.  Patients  may  or  may  not  have  systemic  symptoms  including 
fever and weight loss, and other symptoms include hepatosplenomeg-
aly, lytic bone lesions, and pancytopenia. Immunophenotype includes 
presence of histiocytic markers (CD68, lysozyme, CD11c, CD14) and 
absence of myeloid or lymphoid markers. Prognosis is poor and treat-
ment  often  ineffective.  The  term  malignant  histiocytosis  (MH)  refers 
to  a  disseminated  disease  and  systemic  symptoms.  Lymphoma-like 
treatment induces complete remissions in some patients, and median 
survival is estimated at 2 years.

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis  Langerhans cells (LCs) are spe-
cialized DCs that reside in mucocutaneous tissue and, upon activation, 
become specialized for antigen presentation to T cells. LC histiocytosis 
(LCH; also known as histiocytosis X) represents neoplastic prolifera-
tion of LCs (S100+, CD1a+, and Birbeck granules on electron micros-
copy).  LCH  incidence  is  estimated  at  5  per  million,  and  the  disease 
typically  affects  children  with  a  male  predilection.  Presentation  can 
be either unifocal (eosinophilic granuloma) or multifocal. The former 
usually affects bones and less frequently lymph nodes, skin, and lung, 
whereas the latter is more disseminated. Unifocal disease often affects 
older children and adults, whereas multisystem disease affects infants. 

LCH of the lung in adults is characterized by bilateral nodules. Prog-
nosis depends on organs involved. Only 10% of patients progress from 
unifocal to multiorgan disease. LCH of the lung might improve upon 
cessation of smoking. Approximately 55% of patients with LCH harbor 
BRAF  V600E  gain-of-function  mutations,  which  indicates  high-risk 
disease  and  resistance  to  first-line  therapy;  however,  responses  to 
targeted  therapy  with  vemurafenib  have  been  reported.  Other  forms 
of  treatment  for  LCH  include  combination  chemotherapy  and  MEK 
inhibitors  in  BRAF  wild-type  disease  with  other  MAPK  pathway 
mutations. Unfortunately, such targeted therapy has not secured long- 
lasting, treatment-free remissions.

Langerhans  Cell  Sarcoma  Langerhans  cell  sarcoma  (LCS)  also 
represents neoplastic proliferation of LCs with overtly malignant mor-
phology. The disease can present de novo or progress from antecedent 
LCH.  There  is  a  female  predilection,  and  median  age  at  diagnosis  is 
estimated  at  41  years.  Immunophenotype  is  similar  to  that  seen  in 
LCH,  and  liver,  spleen,  lung,  and  bone  are  the  usual  sites  of  disease. 
Prognosis is poor and treatment generally ineffective.

Interdigitating  Dendritic  Cell  Sarcoma 
Interdigitating  DC 
sarcoma  (IDCS),  also  known  as  reticulum  cell  sarcoma,  represents 
neoplastic  proliferation  of  IDCs.  The  disease  is  extremely  rare  and 
affects elderly adults with no sex predilection. Typical presentation is 
asymptomatic solitary lymphadenopathy. Immunophenotype includes 
S100 positivity and negativity for vimentin and CD1a. Prognosis ranges 
from benign local disease to widespread lethal disease.

Follicular Dendritic Cell Sarcoma  FDCs  reside  in  B-cell  folli-
cles and present antigen to B cells. FDC neoplasms (FDCNs) are usu-
ally localized and often affect adults. FDCN might be associated with  
Castleman’s  disease  in  10–20%  of  cases,  and  increased  incidence  in 
schizophrenia has been reported. Cervical lymph nodes are the most 
frequent site of involvement in FDCN, and other sites include maxillary, 
mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes; oral cavity; gastrointesti-
nal system; skin; and breasts. Sites of metastasis include lung and liver. 
Immunophenotype includes CD21, CD35, and CD23. Clinical course is 
typically indolent, and treatment includes surgical excision followed by 
regional radiotherapy and sometimes systemic chemotherapy.

Hemophagocytic  Syndrome  Hemophagocytic  syndrome  (HPS), 
also known as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), represents 
nonneoplastic proliferation and activation of macrophages that induce 
cytokine-mediated BM suppression and features of intense phagocytosis 
in  BM  and  liver.  HPS  may  result  from  genetic  (primary)  or  acquired 
(secondary)  disorders  of  macrophages.  The  former  entail  genetically 
determined  inability  to  regulate  macrophage  proliferation  and  acti-
vation  and  might  include  alterations  in  familial  HLH  genes  (PRF1, 
UNC13D,  STXBP2,  and  STX11),  granule/pigment  abnormality  genes 
(RAB27A, LYST, and AP3B1), or X-linked lymphoproliferative disease 
genes (SH2D1A and XIAP). Acquired HPS is often precipitated by viral 
infections,  most  notably  Epstein-Barr  virus.  HPS  might  also  accom-
pany  certain  malignancies  such  as  T-cell  lymphoma  and  autoimmune 
diseases.  Clinical  presentation  includes  fever,  severe  constitutional 
symptoms,  enlarged  lymph  nodes,  hepatosplenomegaly,  neurologic 
dysfunction, and abnormalities in multiple organ function tests. Diag-
nosis  is  accomplished  by  either  detection  of  HLH-related  mutations 
or meeting five of the following eight conventional criteria: (1) hemo-
phagocytosis  in  the  BM/spleen/lymph  nodes;  (2)  serum  ferritin  ≥500 
μg/L; (3) hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen ≤1.5 g/L) or hypertriglyceri-
demia (triglycerides ≥3 mmol/L); (4) low NK cell activity; (5) elevated 
soluble  IL-2  receptor  (CD25)  ≥2400  U/mL;  (6)  bi-  or  tricytopenia 
(platelets <100 × 109/L, hemoglobin <9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count 
<1 × 109/L); (7) splenomegaly palpable >3 cm below left costal margin; 
and  (8)  fever.  Clinical  course  is  often  fulminant  and  fatal.  Current 
therapeutic  approaches  for  primary  or  secondary  HLH  include  the 
so-called “HLH-94 protocol,” which consists of weekly treatments with 
etoposide and dexamethasone, stem cell transplantation, emapalumab 
(a monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes interferon γ), and 
the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Emapalumab was FDA approved in

111 Plasma Cell Disorders

Nikhil C. Munshi, Dan L. Longo,  
Kenneth C. Anderson

The  plasma  cell  disorders  are  monoclonal  neoplasms  related  to  each 
other by virtue of their development from common progenitors in the 
late  B-lymphocyte  lineage.  Multiple  myeloma  (MM),  Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia, primary amyloidosis (Chap. 112), and the heavy 
chain diseases comprise this group and may be designated by a variety 
of  synonyms  such  as  monoclonal  gammopathies,  paraproteinemias, 
plasma cell dyscrasias, and dysproteinemias. Mature B lymphocytes des-
tined to produce IgG bear surface immunoglobulin molecules of both 
μ and γ heavy chain isotypes with both isotypes having identical idi-
otypes (variable regions). Under normal circumstances, maturation to 
antibody-secreting plasma cells and their proliferation is stimulated by 
exposure to the antigen for which the surface immunoglobulin is spe-
cific; however, in the plasma cell disorders, the control over this process 
is lost. The clinical manifestations of all the plasma cell disorders relate 
to the expansion of the neoplastic cells, to the secretion of cell products 
(immunoglobulin molecules or subunits, lymphokines), and to some 
extent to the host’s response to the tumor. Normal development of B 
lymphocytes is discussed in Chap. 349 and depicted in Fig. 108-2.

Three  categories  of  structural  variation  are  present  among  immu-
noglobulin molecules that form antigenic determinants, and these are 
used to classify immunoglobulins. Isotypes are those determinants that 
distinguish  among  the  main  classes  of  antibodies  of  a  given  species 
and are the same in all normal individuals of that species. Therefore, 
isotypic determinants are, by definition, recognized by antibodies from 
a  distinct  species  (heterologous  sera)  but  not  by  antibodies  from  the 
same  species  (homologous  sera).  There  are  five  heavy  chain  isotypes 
(M, G, A, D, E) and two light chain isotypes (κ, λ). Allotypes are distinct 
determinants that reflect regular small differences between individuals 

of the same species in the amino acid sequences of otherwise similar 
immunoglobulins.  These  differences  are  determined  by  allelic  genes; 
by definition, they are detected by antibodies made in the same spe-
cies.  Idiotypes  are  the  third  category  of  antigenic  determinants.  They 
are  unique  to  the  molecules  produced  by  a  given  clone  of  antibody- 
producing  cells.  Idiotypes  are  formed  by  the  unique  structure  of  the 
antigen-binding portion of the molecule.

Antibody molecules (Fig. 111-1) are composed of two heavy chains 
(~50,000 molecular weight [mol wt]) and two light chains (~25,000 mol 
wt). Each chain has a constant portion (limited amino acid sequence 
variability) and a variable region (extensive sequence variability). The 
light  and  heavy  chains  are  linked  by  disulfide  bonds  and  are  aligned 
so that their variable regions are adjacent to one another. This variable 
region forms the antigen recognition site of the antibody molecule; its 
unique structural features form idiotypes that are reliable markers for a 
particular clone of cells because each antibody is formed and secreted 
by a single clone. Because of the mechanics of the gene rearrangements 
necessary to specify the immunoglobulin variable regions (VDJ joining 
for the heavy chain, VJ joining for the light chain), a particular clone 
rearranges only one of the two chromosomes to produce an immuno-
globulin molecule of only one light chain isotype and only one allotype 
(allelic exclusion) (Fig. 111-1). After exposure to antigen, the variable 
region may become associated with a new heavy chain isotype (class 
switch).  Each  clone  of  cells  performs  these  sequential  gene  arrange-
ments in a unique way. This results in each clone producing a unique 
immunoglobulin molecule. In most plasma cells, light chains are syn-
thesized in slight excess, secreted as free light chains, and cleared by the 
kidney, but <10 mg of such light chains is excreted per day.

Electrophoretic  analysis  permits  separation  of  components  of  the 
serum  proteins  (Fig.  111-2).  The  immunoglobulins  move  hetero-
geneously  in  an  electric  field  and  form  a  broad  peak  in  the  gamma 
region, which is usually increased in the sera of patients with plasma 
cell tumors. There is a sharp spike in this region called an M component 
(M for monoclonal). Less commonly, the M component may appear in 
the β2 or α2 globulin region. The monoclonal antibody must be present 
at  a  concentration  of  at  least  5  g/L  (0.5  g/dL)  to  be  accurately  quan-
titated  by  this  method.  This  corresponds  to  ~109  cells  producing  the 
antibody. Confirmation of the type of immunoglobulin and that it is 
truly monoclonal is determined by immunoelectrophoresis that reveals 
a single heavy and/or light chain type. Hence, immunoelectrophoresis 
and electrophoresis provide qualitative and quantitative assessment of 
the  M  component,  respectively.  Once  the  presence  of  an  M  compo-
nent has been confirmed, the amount of M component in the serum 
is a reliable measure of the tumor burden, making M component an 
excellent tumor marker to manage therapy, yet it is not specific enough 
to be used to screen asymptomatic patients. In addition to the plasma 
cell disorders, M components may be detected in other lymphoid neo-
plasms such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphomas 
of B- or T-cell origin; nonlymphoid neoplasms such as chronic myeloid 
leukemia, breast cancer, and colon cancer; a variety of nonneoplastic 
conditions such as cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, parasitic diseases, Gaucher’s 
disease,  and  pyoderma  gangrenosum;  and  a  number  of  autoimmune 
conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and cold 
agglutinin disease. Monoclonal proteins are also observed in immuno-
suppressed patients after organ transplant and, rarely, allogeneic trans-
plant. At least two very rare skin diseases—lichen myxedematosus (also 
known as papular mucinosis) and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma—are 
associated  with  a  monoclonal  gammopathy.  In  papular  mucinosis, 
highly cationic IgG is deposited in the dermis of patients. This organ 
specificity  may  reflect  the  specificity  of  the  antibody  for  some  anti-
genic  component  of  the  dermis.  Necrobiotic  xanthogranuloma  is  a 
histiocytic  infiltration  of  the  skin,  usually  of  the  face,  that  produces 
red or yellow nodules that can enlarge to plaques. Approximately 10% 
progress to myeloma. Five percent of patients with sensory motor neu-
ropathy also have a monoclonal paraprotein.

The nature of the M component is variable in plasma cell disorders. 
It may be an intact antibody molecule of any heavy chain subclass, or it 
may be an altered antibody or fragment. Isolated light or heavy chains 
may be produced. In some plasma cell tumors such as extramedullary

FIGURE 111-1  Immunoglobulin genetics and the relationship of gene segments to the antibody protein. The top portion of the figure is a schematic of the organization of the 
immunoglobulin genes, λ on chromosome 22, κ on chromosome 2, and the heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. The heavy chain locus is >2 megabases, and some of the D 
region gene segments are only a few bases long, so the figure depicts the schematic relationship among the segments, not their actual size. The bottom portion of the figure 
outlines the steps in going from the noncontiguous germline gene segments to an intact antibody molecule. Two recombination events juxtapose the V-D-J (or V-J for light 
chains) segments. The rearranged gene is transcribed, and RNA splicing cuts out intervening sequences to produce an mRNA, which is then translated into an antibody light  
or heavy chain. The sites on the antibody that bind to antigen (the so-called CDR3 regions) are encoded by D and J segments for heavy chains and the J segments for  
light chains. (From Janeway’s Immunobiology, 9th ed by Kenneth Murphy and Casey Weaver. Copyright © 2017 by Garland Science, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. Used by

or  solitary  bone  plasmacytomas,  less  than  one-third  of  patients  will 
have  an  M  component.  In  ~20%  of  myelomas,  only  light  chains  are 
produced and, in most cases, are secreted in the urine as Bence Jones 
proteins. The frequency of myelomas of a particular heavy chain class 
is roughly proportional to the serum concentration, and therefore, IgG 
myelomas are more common than IgA and IgD myelomas. In ~1% of 
patients with myeloma, biclonal or triclonal gammopathy is observed.

MULTIPLE MYELOMA
 ■ DEFINITION
MM represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from 
a  single  clone.  The  tumor,  its  products,  and  the  host  response  to  it 
result  in  a  number  of  organ  dysfunctions  and  symptoms,  including 
bone pain or fracture, renal failure, susceptibility to infection, anemia,

many different immunoglobulins in the serum, their differing mobilities in an electric field produce a broad peak. In conditions associated with increases in polyclonal 
immunoglobulin, the broad peak is more prominent (middle panel). In monoclonal gammopathies, the predominance of a product of a single cell produces a “church 
spire” sharp peak, usually in the γ globulin region (right panel). The immunofixation (lower panel) identifies the type of immunoglobulin. For example, normal and polyclonal 
increases in immunoglobulins produce no distinct bands; however, the right panel shows distinct bands in IgG and lambda protein lanes, confirming the presence of IgG 
lambda monoclonal protein. (Courtesy of Dr. Neal I. Lindeman.)

symptoms, and manifestations of hyperviscosity.
 ■ ETIOLOGY
The cause of myeloma is not known. Myeloma occurred with increased 
frequency  in  those  exposed  to  the  radiation  of  nuclear  warheads  in 
World  War  II  after  a  20-year  latency.  Myeloma  has  been  seen  more 
commonly than expected among farmers, wood workers, leather work-
ers, and those exposed to petroleum products. A variety of recurrent 
chromosomal alterations have been found in patients with myeloma: 
hyperdiploidy (trisomies involving one or more of chromosomes 3, 5, 
7, 9, 11, 15, 19, or 21) is observed in half of the patients, while the other 
half have translocations involving the 14q32 chromosome with variable 
partners  including  t(11;14)(q13;q32),  t(4;14)(p16;q32),  and  t(14;16). 
Other frequent abnormalities include 13q14 deletion, 1q amplification 
or 1p deletion, and 17p13 deletions. Evidence is strong that errors in 
switch  recombination—the  genetic  mechanism  to  change  antibody 
heavy chain isotype—participate in the early transformation process. 
However, no single common molecular pathogenetic pathway has yet 
emerged. Genome sequencing studies have failed to identify any recur-
rent mutation with frequency >20%; N-ras, K-ras, and B-raf mutations 
are most common and, combined, occur in >40% of patients. Evidence 
of complex clusters of subclonal variants is present at diagnosis, and 
additional  mutations  are  acquired  over  time,  indicative  of  genomic 
evolution  that  may  drive  disease  progression.  Interleukin  (IL)  6  may 
play a role in driving myeloma cell proliferation. It remains difficult to 
distinguish benign from malignant plasma cells based on morphologic 
criteria in all but a few cases (Fig. 111-3).
 ■ INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE
In 2021 in the United States, 34,920 new cases of myeloma were esti-
mated to be diagnosed, and 12,410 people were estimated to die from 
the  disease.  Myeloma  increases  in  incidence  with  age.  The  median 
age at diagnosis is 69 years; it is uncommon under age 40. Males are 
more  commonly  affected  than  females,  and  blacks  have  nearly  twice 
the  incidence  of  whites.  In  2018,  myeloma  accounted  for  1.8%  of  all 
malignancies,  with  incidence  rates  per  100,000  of  6.1  in  whites  and 
13.6 in blacks.

 ■ GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS
The  incidence  of  myeloma  is  highest  in  blacks  and  Pacific  Islanders; 
intermediate in Europeans and North American whites; and lowest in 
people from developing countries including Asia. The higher incidence 
in more developed countries may result from the combination of a lon-
ger life expectancy and more frequent medical surveillance. Incidence 
of  MM  in  other  ethnic  groups  including  native  Hawaiians,  female 
Hispanics, American Indians from New Mexico, and Alaskan natives is 
higher relative to U.S. whites in the same geographic area. Chinese and 
Japanese populations have a lower incidence than whites. Immunopro-
liferative small-intestinal disease (IPSID) with α heavy chain disease is 
most prevalent in the Mediterranean area. Despite these differences in 
prevalence,  the  characteristics,  response  to  therapy,  and  prognosis  of 
myeloma are similar worldwide.

morphologic features of plasma cells: round or oval cells with an eccentric nucleus 
composed of coarsely clumped chromatin, a densely basophilic cytoplasm, and a 
perinuclear clear zone containing the Golgi apparatus. Binucleate and multinucleate 
malignant plasma cells can be seen.

 ■ PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
MM  cells  bind  via  cell-surface  adhesion  molecules  to  bone  marrow 
stromal cells (BMSCs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which triggers 
MM cell growth, survival, drug resistance, and migration in the bone 
marrow milieu (Fig. 111-4). These effects are due both to direct MM 
cell–BMSC binding via adhesion molecules and to induction of various 
cytokines,  including  IL-6,  insulin-like  growth  factor  type  1  (IGF-1), 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and stromal cell–derived 
growth  factor  (SDF)-1a.  Growth,  drug  resistance,  and  migration  are 
mediated  via  Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated  protein  kinase,  PI3K/Akt, 
and  protein  kinase  C  signaling  cascades,  respectively.  Other  cellular 
elements  in  the  bone  marrow  microenvironment  also  significantly 
impact MM cell growth and survival. The major myeloma supporting 
interactions  are  with  endothelial  cells  and  osteoclasts.  Immune  cells 
such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), myeloid-derived suppres-
sor cells (MDSC), and T helper 17 (TH17) cells are increased in number 
and support myeloma growth, while antimyeloma immune responses, 
especially T helper and cytotoxic cells, B cells, and natural killer T cells, 
are suppressed.

Bone  pain  is  the  most  common  symptom  in  myeloma,  affecting 
nearly  70%  of  patients.  Persistent  localized  pain  usually  signifies  a 
pathologic  fracture.  The  bone  lesions  of  myeloma  are  caused  by  the 
proliferation of tumor cells, activation of osteoclasts that destroy bone, 
and  suppression  of  osteoblasts  that  form  new  bone.  The  increased 
osteoclast activity is mediated by osteoclast activating factors (OAFs) 
produced by the myeloma cells (mediated by several cytokines, includ-
ing  IL-1,  lymphotoxin,  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  [VEGF], 
receptor  activator  of  nuclear  factor-κB  [RANK]  ligand,  macrophage 

inhibitory  factor  [MIP]-1α,  and  tumor  necrosis  factor  [TNF]).  The 
bone lesions are lytic in nature (Fig. 111-5) and are rarely associated 
with osteoblastic new bone formation due to their suppression by dick-
hoff-1 (DKK-1) produced by myeloma cells. Therefore, radioisotopic 
bone  scanning  is  less  useful  in  diagnosis  than  is  plain  radiography. 
The  bony  lysis  results  in  substantial  mobilization  of  calcium  from 
bone,  and  serious  acute  and  chronic  complications  of  hypercalcemia 
may dominate the clinical picture (see below). Localized bone lesions 
may  cause  the  collapse  of  vertebrae,  leading  to  spinal  cord  com-
pression.  The  next  most  common  clinical  problem  in  patients  with 
myeloma  is  susceptibility  to  bacterial  infections.  The  most  common 
infections are pneumonias and pyelonephritis, and the most frequent 
pathogens  are  Streptococcus  pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus  aureus,  and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae in the lungs and Escherichia coli and other gram- 
negative organisms in the urinary tract. In ~25% of patients, recurrent 
infections are the presenting features, and >75% of patients will have 
a serious infection at some time in their course. The susceptibility to 
infection has several contributing causes. First, patients with myeloma 
have diffuse hypogammaglobulinemia if the M component is excluded. 
The hypogammaglobulinemia is related to both decreased production 
and increased destruction of normal antibodies. The large M compo-
nent results in fractional catabolic rates of 8–16% instead of the nor-
mal 2%. Moreover, some patients generate a population of circulating 
regulatory cells in response to their myeloma that can suppress normal 
antibody synthesis. These patients have very poor antibody responses, 
especially  to  polysaccharide  antigens  such  as  those  on  bacterial  cell 
walls.  Various  abnormalities  in  T-cell  function  are  also  observed 
including  decreased  TH1  response,  increase  in  TH17  cells  producing

FIGURE 111-4  Pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma (MM) cells interact with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and extracellular matrix proteins via 
adhesion molecules, triggering adhesion-mediated signaling as well as cytokine production. This triggers cytokine-mediated signaling that provides growth, survival, and 
antiapoptotic effects as well as development of drug resistance. Additional bidirectional interactions lead to inhibition of osteoblast and increase in osteoclast activity 
which leads to bone-related issues in myeloma. Similar interactions with immune microenvironment lead to augmentation of tumor promoting immune responses and 
suppression of tumor protective immune responses, overall allowing myeloma cell growth. (Adapted from G Bianchi, NC Munshi: Blood 125: 3049, 2015.)

proinflammatory  cytokines,  and  aberrant  T  regulatory  cell  function. 
Granulocyte lysozyme content is low, and granulocyte migration is not 
as rapid as normal in patients with myeloma, probably the result of a 
tumor  product.  There  are  also  a  variety  of  abnormalities  in  comple-
ment functions in myeloma patients. All these factors contribute to the 
immune deficiency in these patients. Some commonly used therapeutic 
agents may significantly affect immune function; e.g., dexamethasone 
suppresses immune responses and increases susceptibility to bacterial 
and  fungal  infection,  B-cell  maturation  antigen  (BCMA)–targeting 
chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells can eliminate plasma cells 
inducing  hypogammaglobulinemia,  and  bortezomib  predisposes  to 
herpesvirus reactivation.

Renal failure occurs in nearly 25% of myeloma patients, and some 
renal  pathology  is  noted  in  >50%.  Of  many  contributing  factors, 
hypercalcemia is the most common cause of renal failure. Glomerular 
deposits  of  amyloid,  hyperuricemia,  recurrent  infections,  frequent 
use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for pain control, use of 
iodinated contrast dye for imaging, bisphosphonate use, and occasional 
infiltration of the kidney by myeloma cells all may contribute to renal 
dysfunction. However, tubular damage associated with the excretion of 
light chains is almost always present. Normally, light chains are filtered, 
reabsorbed  in  the  tubules,  and  catabolized.  With  the  increase  in  the 
amount of light chains presented to the tubule, the tubular cells become 
overloaded  with  these  proteins,  and  tubular  damage  results  either 
directly  from  light  chain  toxic  effects  or  indirectly  from  the  release 
of intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The earliest manifestation of this 
tubular  damage  is  the  adult  Fanconi’s  syndrome  (a  type  2  proximal 
renal tubular acidosis), with loss of glucose and amino acids, as well as 
defects in the ability of the kidney to acidify and concentrate the urine. 
The proteinuria is not accompanied by hypertension, and the protein 
is nearly all light chains. Generally, very little albumin is in the urine 
because  glomerular  function  is  usually  normal.  When  the  glomeruli 
are  involved,  nonselective  proteinuria  is  also  observed.  Patients  with 
myeloma also have a decreased anion gap [i.e., Na+ – (Cl− + HCO3
−)] 
because the M component is cationic, resulting in retention of chloride. 
This is often accompanied by hyponatremia that is felt to be artificial 
(pseudohyponatremia) because each volume of serum has less water as 
a result of the increased protein. Renal dysfunction due to light chain 
deposition  disease,  light  chain  cast  nephropathy,  and  amyloidosis  is 
partially  reversible  with  effective  therapy.  Myeloma  patients  are  sus-
ceptible to developing acute renal failure if they become dehydrated.

Normocytic and normochromic anemia occurs in ~80% of myeloma 
patients.  It  is  usually  related  to  the  replacement  of  normal  marrow  by 
expanding tumor cells, to the inhibition of hematopoiesis by factors made 
by  the  tumor,  to  reduced  production  of  erythropoietin  by  the  kidney, 
and to the effects of long-term therapy. In addition, mild hemolysis may 
contribute to the anemia. A larger than expected fraction of patients may 
have megaloblastic anemia due to either folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. 
Granulocytopenia  and  thrombocytopenia  are  rare  except  when  ther-
apy-induced.  Clotting  abnormalities  may  be  seen  due  to  the  failure  of 
antibody-coated platelets to function properly; the interaction of the M 
component with clotting factors I, II, V, VII, or VIII; antibody to clotting 
factors;  or  amyloid  damage  of  endothelium.  Deep  venous  thrombosis 
is  also  observed  with  use  of  thalidomide,  lenalidomide,  or  pomalid-
omide  in  combination  with  dexamethasone.  Raynaud’s  phenomenon 
and  impaired  circulation  may  result  if  the  M  component  forms  cryo-
globulins,  and  hyperviscosity  syndromes  may  develop  depending  on 
the physical properties of the M component (most common with IgM, 
IgG3, and IgA paraproteins). Hyperviscosity is defined based on the rel-
ative viscosity of serum as compared with water. Normal relative serum 
viscosity is 1.8 (i.e., serum is normally almost twice as viscous as water). 
Symptoms of hyperviscosity occur at a level greater than 4 centipoises 
(cP), which is usually reached at paraprotein concentrations of ~40 g/L 
(4 g/dL) for IgM, 50 g/L (5 g/dL) for IgG3, and 70 g/L (7 g/dL) for IgA; 
however, depending on chemical and physical properties of the parapro-
tein molecule, it can occasionally be observed at lower levels.

Although neurologic symptoms occur in a minority of patients, they 
may  have  many  causes.  Hypercalcemia  may  produce  lethargy,  weak-
ness, depression, and confusion. Hyperviscosity may lead to headache, 
fatigue, shortness of breath, exacerbation or precipitation of heart fail-
ure, visual disturbances, ataxia, vertigo, retinopathy, somnolence, and 
coma. Bony damage and collapse may lead to cord compression, radic-
ular pain, and loss of bowel and bladder control. Infiltration of periph-
eral nerves by amyloid can be a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome and 
other  sensorimotor  mono-  and  polyneuropathies.  Neuropathy  asso-
ciated  with  monoclonal  gammopathy  of  undetermined  significance 
(MGUS)  and  myeloma  is  more  frequently  sensory  than  motor  neur-
opathy and is associated with IgM more than other isotypes. In >50% 
of  patients  with  neuropathy,  the  IgM  monoclonal  protein  is  directed 
against myelin-associated globulin (MAG). Sensory neuropathy is also 
a side effect of therapy, specifically thalidomide and bortezomib.

Many  of  the  clinical  features  of  myeloma,  e.g.,  cord  compression, 
pathologic  fractures,  hyperviscosity,  sepsis,  and  hypercalcemia,  can 
present as medical emergencies. Despite the widespread distribution of 
plasma cells in the body, tumor expansion is dominantly within bone 
and bone marrow and, for reasons unknown, rarely causes enlargement 
of spleen, lymph nodes, or gut-associated lymphatic tissue.

 ■ DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING
The  diagnosis  of  myeloma  requires  marrow  plasmacytosis  (>10%),  a 
serum  and/or  urine  M  component,  and  at  least  one  of  the  myeloma- 
defining events detailed in Table 111-1. Bone marrow plasma cells are 
CD138+ and either monoclonal kappa or lambda light chain positive. 
The  most  important  differential  diagnosis  in  patients  with  myeloma 
involves  their  separation  from  individuals  with  MGUS  or  smolder-
ing  multiple  myeloma  (SMM).  MGUS  is  vastly  more  common  than 
myeloma,  occurring  in  1%  of  the  population  aged  >50  years  and  in 
up  to  10%  of  individuals  aged  >75  years.  The  diagnostic  criteria  for 

MGUS,  SMM,  and  myeloma  are  described  in  Table  111-1.  Although 
~1% of patients per year with MGUS go on to develop myeloma, all 
cases of myeloma are preceded by MGUS. Non-IgG subtype, abnormal 
kappa/lambda  free  light  chain  ratio,  and  serum  M  protein  >15  g/L  
(1.5 g/dL) are associated with higher incidence of progression of MGUS 
to myeloma. Absence of all three features predicts a 5% chance of pro-
gression,  whereas  higher-risk  MGUS  with  the  presence  of  all  three 
features predicts a 60% chance of progression over 20 years. The fea-
tures responsible for higher risk of progression from SMM to MM are 
bone marrow plasmacytosis >10%, abnormal kappa/lambda free light 
chain ratio, and serum M protein >30 g/L (3 g/dL). Patients with only 
one of these three features have a 25% chance of progression to MM 
in 5 years, whereas patients with high-risk SMM with all three features 
have a 76% chance of progression. Two important variants of myeloma 
are solitary bone plasmacytoma and solitary extramedullary plasmacy-
toma. These lesions are associated with an M component in <30% of 
the cases, they may affect younger individuals, and both are associated

hemangiomata, plethora, acrocyanosis, flushing, and white nails); (e) papilledema; (f) thrombocytosis/polycythemiag

aClonality should be established by showing κ/λ light chain restriction on flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell 
percentage should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of a disparity between the aspirate and core biopsy, the highest value should be 
used. bMeasured or estimated by validated equations. CIf bone marrow has <10% clonal plasma cells, more than one bone lesion is required to distinguish from solitary 
plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement. dThese values are based on the serum Freelite assay (The Binding Site Group, Birmingham, United Kingdom). The involved 
free light chain must be ≥100 mg/L. eEach focal lesion must be ≥5 mm in size. fA small M component may sometimes be present. gThese features should have no other 
attributable causes and have temporal relation with each other.

872 with median survivals of ≥10 years. Solitary bone plasmacytoma is a 
single lytic bone lesion without marrow plasmacytosis. Extramedullary 
plasmacytomas usually involve the submucosal lymphoid tissue of the 
nasopharynx or paranasal sinuses without marrow plasmacytosis. Both 
tumors are highly responsive to local radiation therapy. If an M com-
ponent  is  present,  it  should  disappear  after  treatment.  Solitary  bone 
plasmacytomas may recur in other bony sites or evolve into myeloma. 
Extramedullary plasmacytomas rarely recur or progress.

Serum  protein  electrophoresis  and  measurement  of  serum  immu-
noglobulins and free light chains are useful for detecting and charac-
terizing M spikes, supplemented by immunoelectrophoresis, which is 
especially  sensitive  for  identifying  low  concentrations  of  M  compo-
nents not detectable by protein electrophoresis. A 24-h urine specimen 
is necessary to quantitate Bence Jones protein (immunoglobulin light 
chain)  excretion.  The  serum  M  component  will  be  IgG  in  53%  of 
patients,  IgA  in  25%,  and  IgD  in  1%;  20%  of  patients  will  have  only 
light chains in serum and urine. Dipsticks for detecting proteinuria are 
not reliable at identifying light chains, and the heat test for detecting 
Bence Jones protein is falsely negative in ~50% of patients with light 
chain  myeloma.  Fewer  than  1%  of  patients  have  no  identifiable  M 
component; these patients usually have light chain myeloma in which 
renal catabolism has made the light chains undetectable in the urine. 
In most of these patients, light chains can now be detected by serum 
free light chain assay. IgD myeloma may also present with light chain 
disease. About two-thirds of patients with serum M components also 
have urinary light chains. The light chain isotype may have an impact 
on disease behavior. Whether this is due to some genetically important 
determinant  of  cell  proliferation  or  because  lambda  light  chains  are 
more likely to cause renal damage and form amyloid than are kappa 
light  chains  is  unclear.  The  heavy  chain  isotype  may  have  an  impact 
on patient management as well. About half of patients with IgM para-
proteins develop hyperviscosity compared with only 2–4% of patients 
with IgA and IgG M components. Among IgG myelomas, it is the IgG3 
subclass  that  has  the  highest  tendency  to  form  both  concentration- 
and temperature-dependent aggregates, leading to hyperviscosity and 
cold agglutination at lower serum concentrations. A standard workup 
directed at detecting monoclonal plasma cells and myeloma-defining 
events as well as prognosis is detailed in Table 111-2.

A complete blood count with differential may reveal anemia. Ery-
throcyte sedimentation rate is elevated. Rare patients (~1%) may have 
plasma cell leukemia with >2000 plasma cells/μL. This may be seen in 
disproportionate  frequency  in  IgD  (12%)  and  IgE  (25%)  myelomas. 
Serum  calcium,  urea  nitrogen,  creatinine,  and  uric  acid  levels  may 
be elevated. Serum alkaline phosphatase is usually normal even with 
extensive  bone  involvement  because  of  the  absence  of  osteoblastic 
activity. It is also important to quantitate serum β2-microglobulin and 
albumin (see below).

Chest and bone radiographs may reveal lytic lesions or diffuse oste-
openia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a sensitive means to 
document extent of bone marrow infiltration and cord or root compres-
sion in patients with pain syndromes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) 
positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is a 
valuable tool to assess bone damage and detect extramedullary sites of 
the disease (Fig. 111-5). The use of 18F-FDG PET/CT is recommended 
to  distinguish  between  smoldering  and  active  MM  and  to  confirm  a 
suspected diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma. It is also a valuable tool 
to evaluate response in patients with oligo- or nonsecretory myeloma.

 ■ PROGNOSIS
Serum β2-microglobulin is the single most powerful predictor of survival 
and  can  substitute  for  staging.  β2-Microglobulin  is  the  light  chain  of 
the class I major histocompatibility antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C) on the 
surface  of  every  cell.  Combination  of  serum  β2-microglobulin  and 
albumin levels forms the basis for a three-stage International Staging 
System (ISS) (Table 111-3) that predicts survival. With the use of high-
dose therapy and the newer agents, the Durie-Salmon staging system is 
unable to predict outcome and is no longer used. High labeling index, 
circulating plasma cells, performance status, and high levels of lactate 
dehydrogenase are also associated with poor prognosis.

Other  factors  that  may  influence  prognosis  are  detection  of  any 
cytogenetic  abnormalities  including  hypodiploidy  by  karyotype,  flu-
orescent  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH)–identified  chromosome  17p 
deletion,  and  translocations  t(4;14),  (14;16),  and  t(14;20)  and  1q34 
amplification.  Chromosome  13q  deletion,  previously  thought  to  pre-
dict poor outcome, is not a predictor following the use of newer agents. 
The ISS system incorporating the cytogenetic changes (Revised ISS) is 
the  most  widely  used  method  for  assessing  prognosis  (Table  111-3). 
Microarray profiling has formed the basis for RNA-based prognostic 
staging  systems.  Genome  sequencing  efforts  have  allowed  for  char-
acterization  of  critical  genes,  pathways,  and  clonal  heterogeneity  in 
myeloma. The median number of mutations per transcribed genome in 
myeloma is ~58, and within the whole genome, it is >7000. A very het-
erogeneous mutational landscape with no unifying mutation has been 
observed.  The  most  frequently  mutated  genes  are  KRAS  and  NRAS 
(~20% each), followed by TP53, DIS3, FAM46C, and BRAF, all mutated 
in 5–10% of patients. All other mutations were observed in <5% of the 
patients. These results are now being applied to develop new targeted 
personalized therapies in myeloma.

No  specific  intervention  is  indicated  for  patients  with  MGUS. 
Follow-up  once  a  year  or  less  frequently  is  adequate  except  in 
higher-risk MGUS, where serum protein electrophoresis, complete 
blood  count,  creatinine,  and  calcium  should  be  repeated  every   
6 months. A patient with MGUS and severe polyneuropathy is con-
sidered for therapeutic intervention if a causal relationship can be

assumed, especially in the absence of any other potential causes for 
neuropathy. Therapy can include plasmapheresis and occasionally 
rituximab  in  patients  with  IgM  MGUS  or  myeloma-like  therapy 
in those with IgG or IgA disease. A subset of patients with MGUS 
develop  renal  dysfunction  usually  based  on  renal  damage  from 
the  monoclonal  antibody.  The  damage  may  affect  the  glomeruli, 
tubules, or vessels. No consensus exists on management, but lower-
ing the level of the monoclonal antibody with bortezomib has had 
some advocates.

course demonstrating only slow progression of disease over many 
years. For patients with SMM, no specific therapeutic intervention 
is  indicated,  although  early  intervention  with  lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone  may  prevent  progression  from  high-risk  SMM  to 
active MM. At present, patients with SMM only require antitumor 
therapy when myeloma-defining events are identified.

Patients  with  solitary  bone  plasmacytomas  and  extramedullary 
plasmacytomas  may  be  expected  to  enjoy  prolonged  disease-free 
survival  after  local  radiation  therapy  at  a  dose  of  ~40  Gy.  Occult 
marrow involvement may occur at low incidence in patients with 
solitary  bone  plasmacytoma.  Such  patients  are  usually  identified 
because  their  serum  M  component  falls  slowly  or  disappears  ini-
tially after local therapy, only to return after a few months. These 
patients respond well to systemic therapy. 
SYMPTOMATIC MM
Patients  with  symptomatic  myeloma  require  therapeutic  inter-
vention.  In  general,  such  therapy  has  two  purposes:  (1)  systemic 
therapy  to  control  myeloma;  and  (2)  supportive  care  to  control 
symptoms of the disease, its complications, and adverse effects of 
therapy. Therapy can significantly prolong survival and improve the 
quality of life for myeloma patients.

The  therapy  of  myeloma  includes  an  initial  induction  regimen 
followed  by  consolidation  and/or  maintenance  therapy  and,  on 
subsequent progression, management of relapsed disease. All agents 
available  for  use  at  various  stages  of  the  therapy  and  their  doses, 
schedules, and combinations are detailed in Table 111-4. Therapy 
is partly dictated by the patient’s age and comorbidities, which may 
affect  a  patient’s  ability  to  undergo  high-dose  therapy  and  trans-
plantation (Fig. 111-6).

Three  important  classes  of  agents  approved  for  treatment  of 
newly diagnosed MM are immunomodulatory agents, proteasome 
inhibitors, and targeted antibodies. Thalidomide, when combined 
with  dexamethasone,  achieved  responses  in  two-thirds  of  newly 
diagnosed  MM  patients.  Subsequently,  lenalidomide,  an  immu-
nomodulatory  derivative  of  thalidomide,  and  bortezomib,  a  pro-
teasome inhibitor, have each been combined with dexamethasone 
with  high  response  rates  (>80%)  in  newly  diagnosed  patients 
with MM. Importantly, their lower toxicity profile with improved 
efficacy  has  made  them  the  preferred  agents  for  induction  ther-
apy. Efforts to improve the depth and frequency of response have 
involved  using  three-drug  regimens.  The  combination  of  lenalid-
omide  with  a  proteasome  inhibitor  (bortezomib  or  carfilzomib) 
and  dexamethasone  achieves  close  to  a  100%  response  rate  and  a 
>30% complete response (CR) rate, making this combination one 
of the preferred induction regimens in transplant-eligible patients. 
Other similar three-drug combinations (bortezomib, thalidomide, 
and  dexamethasone  or  bortezomib,  cyclophosphamide,  and  dex-
amethasone) also achieve >90% response rate. Addition of a fourth 
agent,  daratumumab,  an  anti-CD38  antibody,  is  providing  even 
deeper responses. Usually between four and six cycles of these com-
bination regimens are utilized to achieve initial deep cytoreduction 
before consideration of high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell 
transplantation.

In patients who are not transplant candidates due to physiologic 
age  >70  years,  significant  cardiopulmonary  problems,  or  other 
comorbid  illnesses,  the  same  two-  or  three-drug  combinations 
described  above  are  considered  standard  of  care  as  induction 
therapy  with  age-  and  frailty-guided  dose  and  schedule  modifi-
cations. Modified lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (RVD 
lite)  combination  achieves  high  overall  response  rate  (86%)  and 
CR  (32%).  Intermittent  pulses  of  melphalan,  an  alkylating  agent, 
with prednisone (MP) are combined with novel agents to achieve 
superior response and survival outcomes. In patients >65 years old, 
combining  thalidomide  with  MP  (MPT)  obtains  higher  response 
rates  and  overall  survival  compared  with  MP  alone.  Similarly, 
significantly  improved  response  (71  vs  35%)  and  overall  survival 
(3-year  survival  72  vs  59%)  were  observed  with  the  combination 
of bortezomib and MP compared with MP alone. Continuous use 
of  the  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  combination  appears  to 
be  superior  to  the  MPT  regimen,  and  its  combination  with  the 
anti-CD38  antibody  daratumumab  provides  even  higher  overall 
response (92.9%) and CR rates (46.7%) and improved survival; the 
combination of lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and daratumumab is 
a standard-of-care regimen for older adults with myeloma. 

HIGH-DOSE THERAPY WITH AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL 
TRANSPLANTATION
High-dose therapy (HDT) and consolidation/maintenance are stan-
dard practice in the majority of eligible patients. In patients who are 
transplant candidates, alkylating agents such as melphalan should 
be  avoided  because  they  damage  stem  cells  and  compromise  the 
ability to collect stem cells. Similarly, in patients receiving lenalid-
omide,  stem  cells  should  be  collected  within  6  months  because 
the continued use of lenalidomide may compromise the ability to 
collect adequate numbers of stem cells. Randomized studies com-
paring standard-dose therapy to high-dose melphalan therapy with 
hematopoietic stem cell support have shown that HDT can achieve 
higher  overall  response  rates,  with  up  to  25–40%  additional  CRs 
and prolonged progression-free and overall survival; however, few, 
if any, patients are cured. Although two successive HDTs (tandem

transplantations)  are  more  effective  than  single  HDT,  the  benefit 
is  only  observed  in  the  subset  of  patients  who  do  not  achieve  a 
complete or very good partial response to the first transplantation, 
which is a rare subset. Moreover, a randomized study failed to show 
any  significant  difference  in  overall  survival  between  early  trans-
plantation  after  induction  therapy  versus  delayed  transplantation 
at  relapse.  These  data  allow  an  option  to  delay  transplantation, 
especially with the availability of newer agents and combinations. 
Allogeneic transplantations may also produce high response rates, 
but  with  significant  toxicities.  Nonmyeloablative  allogeneic  trans-
plantation  can  reduce  toxicity  but  is  recommended  only  under 
the  auspices  of  a  clinical  trial  to  exploit  an  immune  graft-versus- 
myeloma effect while avoiding attendant toxicity.

Maintenance  therapy  prolongs  remissions  following  standard- 
dose regimens as well as HDT. Two phase 3 studies have demon-
strated improved progression-free survival, and one study showed 
prolonged overall survival in patients receiving lenalidomide com-
pared  to  placebo  as  maintenance  therapy  after  HDT.  In  non-
transplant  candidates,  two  phase  3  studies  showed  prolonged 
progression-free survival with lenalidomide maintenance after MP 
plus lenalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone induction 
therapy. Although concern arises regarding an increased incidence 
of second primary malignancies in patients receiving lenalidomide 
maintenance,  its  benefits  in  reducing  the  risk  of  progressive  dis-
ease  and  death  from  myeloma  far  outweigh  the  small  increased 
risk  of  second  cancers.  In  patients  with  high-risk  cytogenetics, 
lenalidomide  and  bortezomib  or  an  oral  proteasome  inhibitor, 
ixazomib, show promise as maintenance combination therapy after 
transplantation. 

RELAPSED DISEASE
Relapsed myeloma can be treated with a number of agents includ-
ing  lenalidomide  and/or  bortezomib,  if  previously  not  used.  The 
second-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and immuno-
modulatory  agent  pomalidomide  have  shown  efficacy  in  relapsed 
and  refractory  MM,  even  MM  refractory  to  lenalidomide  and 
bortezomib. An oral proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, has also been 
approved in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as 
an all-oral regimen for relapsed MM. Three antibodies are approved 
for  treatment  of  relapsed  MM.  Daratumumab  targeting  CD38 
achieves high response rates and improved progression-free survival 
as a single agent with further improvement in response and survival 
when  added  to  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  or  lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone. A formulation of daratumumab for subcutane-
ous administration provides decreased toxicity and improved con-
venience.  Isatuximab,  another  antibody  targeting  CD38,  achieves 
high response rates and improved progression-free survival in com-
bination  with  pomalidomide  or  carfilzomib  and  dexamethasone. 
Elotuzumab, which targets SLAMF7, has shown significant activity 
in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed/
refractory myeloma but not as a single agent. Panobinostat, a histone 
deacetylase  inhibitor,  in  combination  with  bortezomib  and  dex-
amethasone has been approved for treatment of relapsed refractory 
myeloma based on superior response and progression-free survival 
compared to bortezomib and dexamethasone alone. Two additional 
newer agents have unique mechanisms of action: selinexor is a first-
in-class exportin inhibitor that blocks export of proteins from the 
cell  nucleus,  and  melflufen  is  an  alkylating  agent  conjugated  to  a 
peptide to improve specific delivery to myeloma cells that express 
aminopeptidase  required  for  cleaving  of  the  peptide  to  deliver 
the  drug  intracellularly  in  myeloma  cells.  Both  agents  have  been 
approved  based  on  their  effectiveness  in  relapsed/refractory  mye-
loma. Another therapeutic focus has been to target BCMA, which is 
exclusively expressed on normal plasma cells and myeloma cells. An 
anti-BCMA  antibody-drug  conjugate,  belantamab,  targets  BCMA 
and  delivers  auristatin  to  the  tumor  cells  and  achieves  responses 
in  relapsed/refractory  myeloma.  The  drug  has  a  unique  ophthal-
mologic  toxicity  that  requires  close  monitoring.  Finally,  a  cellular 
therapy approved for myeloma is an anti-BCMA CAR transduced

T cell (idecabtagene vicleucel [Ide-cel]), which is approved beyond 
fourth-line  therapy.  In  patients  with  advanced  myeloma  with  a 
median of six prior lines of treatment, 73% of patients receiving Ide-
cel responded, and a CR rate of 33% was observed. Cytokine release 
syndrome  and  neurotoxicity  remain  primary  toxicities  requiring 
close  monitoring  and  aggressive  management.  BCMA  is  also  the 
target for a number of investigational agents including other CAR-T 
cell  approaches  as  well  as  bispecific  antibodies  combining  anti- 
BCMA  with  anti-CD3  antibody.  Incorporation  of  the  large  num-
ber  of  active  agents  at  various  stages  of  treatment,  including  in 
newly diagnosed patients, is improving survival as well as quality  
of life. 

THERAPY ENDPOINT
Improvement  in  the  serum  M  component  may  lag  behind  the 
symptomatic improvement due to longer serum half-life (~3 weeks) 
of the immunoglobulin. The fall in M component depends on the 
rate of tumor kill and the fractional catabolic rate of immunoglob-
ulin.  Serum  and  urine  light  chains  with  a  functional  half-life  of   
~6  h  may  fall  much  quicker  within  the  first  week  of  treatment. 
Because  urine  light  chain  levels  may  relate  to  renal  tubular  func-
tion,  they  are  not  a  reliable  measure  of  tumor  cell  kill  in  patients 
with  renal  dysfunction.  Achieving  CR,  defined  as  disappearance 
of serum and urine monoclonal protein with normal bone marrow 
by  light  microscopy,  has  been  a  standard  goal  of  therapy.  How-
ever,  sequencing  or  multicolor  flow  cytometry–based  assessment 
of  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  in  bone  marrow  to  measure 
the presence of one myeloma cell in a million cells is being consid-
ered as an important new endpoint, especially in newly diagnosed 
patients. Absence of MRD at this sensitivity predicts for both longer  
progression-free  survival  and  longer  overall  survival.  Although 
patients  may  not  achieve  complete  remission,  clinical  responses 
may last for long periods of time in small numbers of patients.

The  median  overall  survival  of  patients  with  myeloma  is   
8+ years, with subsets of younger patients surviving >10 years. The 
major causes of death are progressive myeloma, renal failure, sepsis, 
or therapy-related myelodysplasia. Nearly a quarter of patients die 
of myocardial infarction, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or stroke, 
which  are  all  intercurrent  illnesses  related  more  to  the  age  of  the 
patient group than to the tumor. 

SUPPORTIVE THERAPY
Herpes  zoster  prophylaxis  is  indicated  if  bortezomib  is  used,  and 
neuropathy attendant to bortezomib can be decreased both by its 
subcutaneous  administration  and  by  administration  on  a  weekly 
schedule.  Lenalidomide  use  requires  prophylaxis  for  deep-vein 
thrombosis (DVT) with either aspirin or, if patients are at a greater 
risk  of  DVT,  warfarin,  low-molecular-weight  heparin,  or  direct- 
acting  anticoagulants.  Patients  receiving  anti-BCMA  CAR-T  cell 
therapy may need supplementation with intravenous γ globulin due 
to induction of prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia.

Supportive  care  directed  at  the  anticipated  complications  of 
the  disease  may  be  as  important  as  primary  antitumor  therapy. 
Hypercalcemia  generally  responds  well  to  bisphosphonates,  glu-
cocorticoid therapy, hydration, and natriuresis and rarely requires 
calcitonin  as  well.  Bisphosphonates  (e.g.,  pamidronate  90  mg  or 
zoledronate 4 mg initially once a month for 12–24 months and later 
every  2–3  months)  reduce  osteoclastic  bone  resorption  and  pre-
serve performance status and quality of life, decrease bone-related 
complications, and may also have antitumor effects. Osteonecrosis 
of the jaw and renal dysfunction can occur in a minority of patients 
receiving  bisphosphonate  therapy.  Denosumab  is  an  alternative 
agent administered intravenously at 120 mg monthly and achieves 
a similar level of effect as bisphosphonates to prevent bone-related 
complications in myeloma. Treatments aimed at strengthening the 
skeleton such as fluorides, calcium, and vitamin D, with or without 
androgens,  have  been  suggested  but  are  not  of  proven  efficacy. 
Kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty should be considered in patients with 
painful collapsed vertebra. Iatrogenic worsening of renal function

may  be  prevented  by  maintaining  a  high  fluid  intake  to  prevent 
dehydration and enhance excretion of light chains and calcium. In 
the event of acute renal failure, plasmapheresis is ~10 times more 
effective at clearing light chains than peritoneal dialysis; however, 
its role in reversing renal failure remains controversial. Importantly, 
reducing the protein load by effective antitumor therapy with agents 
such as bortezomib may result in improvement in renal function in 
over half of the patients. Use of lenalidomide in renal failure is pos-
sible but requires dose modification because it is renally excreted. 
Urinary  tract  infections  should  be  watched  for  and  treated  early. 
Plasmapheresis may be the treatment of choice for hyperviscosity 
syndromes. Although the pneumococcus is a dreaded pathogen in 
myeloma patients, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines may not 
elicit an antibody response. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 
are  more  protective.  Prophylactic  administration  of  intravenous 
γ globulin preparations is used in the setting of recurrent serious 
infections.  Chronic  oral  antibiotic  prophylaxis  is  not  warranted. 
Patients developing neurologic symptoms in the lower extremities, 
severe  localized  back  pain,  or  problems  with  bowel  and  bladder 
control  may  need  emergency  MRI  and  local  radiation  therapy 
and  glucocorticoids  if  cord  compression  is  identified.  In  patients 
in  whom  neurologic  deficit  is  increasing  or  substantial,  emer-
gent surgical decompression may be necessary. Most bone lesions 
respond  to  analgesics  and  systemic  therapy,  but  certain  painful 
lesions  may  respond  more  promptly  to  localized  radiation.  The 
anemia  associated  with  myeloma  may  respond  to  erythropoietin 
along with hematinics (iron, folate, cobalamin). The pathogenesis 
of the anemia should be established and specific therapy instituted, 
whenever possible.

WALDENSTRÖM’S MACROGLOBULINEMIA
In  1948,  Waldenström  described  a  malignancy  of  lymphoplasmacy-
toid cells that secreted IgM. In contrast to myeloma, the disease was 
associated  with  lymphadenopathy  and  hepatosplenomegaly,  but  the 
major  clinical  manifestation  was  hyperviscosity  syndrome.  The  dis-
ease  resembles  the  related  diseases  CLL,  myeloma,  and  lymphocytic 
lymphoma.  It  originates  from  a  post–germinal  center  B  cell  that  has 
undergone somatic mutations and antigenic selection in the lymphoid 
follicle and has the characteristics of an IgM-bearing memory B cell. 
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) and IgM myeloma follow a 
similar clinical course, but therapeutic options are different. The diag-
nosis of IgM myeloma is usually reserved for patients with lytic bone 
lesions and predominant infiltration with CD138+ plasma cells in the 
bone marrow. Such patients are at greater risk of pathologic fractures 
than patients with WM.

A familial occurrence is common in WM, but its molecular bases 
are yet unclear. A distinct MYD88 L265P somatic mutation is present 
in >90% of patients with WM and the majority of IgM MGUS. Other 
commonly  occurring  mutations  include  CXCR4  (30–40%),  ARID1A 
(17%),  and  CD79B  (8–15%).  Presence  of  MYD88  mutation  status  is 
now used as a diagnostic test to discriminate WM from marginal zone 
lymphomas  (MZLs),  IgM-secreting  myeloma,  and  CLL  with  plasma-
cytic differentiation. This mutation also explains the molecular patho-
genesis of the disease with involvement of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and 
interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling leading to activation of IL-1R–
associated kinase (IRAK) 4 and IRAK1 followed by nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB)  activation.  MYD88  mutation  also  triggers  Bruton’s  tyrosine 
kinase  (BTK)  and  hemopoietic  cell  kinase  (HCK)-mediated  growth 
and survival signaling, which are now important therapeutic targets in 
WM. CXCR4 mutations induce AKT and extracellular regulated kinase 
1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. This pathway can lead to development of drug 
resistance in the presence of its ligand CXCL12.

The disease is similar to myeloma in being slightly more common 
in  men  and  occurring  with  increased  incidence  with  increasing  age 
(median  age  64  years).  The  IgM  in  some  patients  with  macroglob-
ulinemia  may  have  specificity  for  myelin-associated  glycoprotein 
(MAG), a protein that has been associated with demyelinating disease 
of  the  peripheral  nervous  system  and  may  be  lost  earlier  and  to  a 

greater extent than the better-known myelin basic protein in patients 
with  multiple  sclerosis.  Sometimes  patients  with  macroglobulinemia 
develop a peripheral neuropathy, and half of these patients are positive 
for anti-MAG antibody. The neuropathy may precede the appearance 
of the neoplasm. The whole process may begin with a viral infection 
that  may  elicit  an  antibody  response  that  cross-reacts  with  a  normal 
tissue component.

Like  myeloma,  the  disease  involves  the  bone  marrow,  but  unlike 
myeloma, it does not cause bone lesions or hypercalcemia. Bone mar-
row  shows  >10%  infiltration  with  lymphoplasmacytic  cells  (surface 
IgM+,  CD19+,  CD20+,  and  CD22+,  rarely  CD5+,  but  CD10−  and 
CD23−) with an increase in number of mast cells. Like myeloma, an 
M component is present in the serum in excess of 30 g/L (3 g/dL), but 
unlike myeloma, the size of the IgM paraprotein results in little renal 
excretion,  and  only  ~20%  of  patients  excrete  light  chains.  Therefore, 
renal disease is not common. The light chain isotype is kappa in 80% of 
the cases. Patients present with weakness, fatigue, and recurrent infec-
tions  similar  to  myeloma  patients,  but  epistaxis,  visual  disturbances, 
and  neurologic  symptoms  such  as  peripheral  neuropathy,  dizziness, 
headache,  and  transient  paresis  are  much  more  common  in  macro-
globulinemia. Presence of MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations also affects 
disease presentation. Presence of CXCR4 mutations is associated with 
higher  bone  marrow  disease  burden  and  higher  incidence  of  hyper-
viscosity.  Patients  with  wild-type  MYD88  show  lower  bone  marrow 
disease burden.

Physical examination reveals adenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, 
and ophthalmoscopic examination may reveal vascular segmentation 
and dilation of the retinal veins characteristic of hyperviscosity states. 
Patients may have a normocytic, normochromic anemia, but rouleaux 
formation and a positive Coombs test are much more common than in 
myeloma. Malignant lymphocytes are usually present in the peripheral 
blood. About 10% of macroglobulins are cryoglobulins. These are pure 
M components and are not the mixed cryoglobulins seen in rheuma-
toid  arthritis  and  other  autoimmune  diseases.  Mixed  cryoglobulins 
are composed of IgM or IgA complexed with IgG, for which they are 
specific.  In  both  cases,  Raynaud’s  phenomenon  and  serious  vascular 
symptoms precipitated by the cold may occur, but mixed cryoglobu-
lins are not commonly associated with malignancy. Patients suspected 
of  having  a  cryoglobulin  based  on  history  and  physical  examination 
should have their blood drawn into a warm syringe and delivered to the 
laboratory in a container of warm water to avoid errors in quantitating 
the cryoglobulin.

A  diagnosis  of  WM  requires  lymphoplasmacytic  infiltrate  of  any 
level  in  the  bone  marrow  and  an  IgM  monoclonal  paraprotein  of 
any  size.  Treatment  is  usually  not  initiated  unless  the  disease  is 
symptomatic or increasing anemia, hyperviscosity, lymphadenopa-
thy, or hepatosplenomegaly is present. Control of serious hypervis-
cosity symptoms such as an altered state of consciousness or paresis 
can  be  achieved  acutely  by  plasmapheresis  because  80%  of  the 
IgM  paraprotein  is  intravascular.  The  median  survival  of  affected 
individuals  is  ~50  months.  However,  many  patients  with  WM 
have  indolent  disease  that  does  not  require  therapy.  Pretreatment 
parameters  including  older  age,  male  sex,  general  symptoms,  and 
cytopenias  define  a  high-risk  population.  BTK  inhibitors  (ibruti-
nib), alkylating drugs (bendamustine and cyclophosphamide), and 
proteasome  inhibitors  (bortezomib,  carfilzomib,  and  ixazomib), 
alone or more frequently in combination with rituximab, are con-
sidered  as  first-line  therapy  for  symptomatic  patients  with  WM. 
Ibrutinib targets the constitutively activated BTK. In patients with 
one prior line of therapy, the overall response to ibrutinib was 91%. 
Best responses to ibrutinib are observed in patients with mutated 
MYD88  and  wild-type  CXCR4  status,  while  delayed  and  lower 
response  rates  to  ibrutinib  are  observed  in  patients  with  mutated 
CXCR4. At first relapse, in patients with an initial durable response,

either  the  previous  regimen  or  another  primary  therapy  regimen 
can be used. The therapeutic choice is dependent upon the genomic 
features, drug availability, and the patient’s clinical profile.

Rituximab  can  produce  an  IgM  flare,  so  either  plasmaphere-
sis  should  be  used  before  rituximab  or  its  use  should  be  initially 
withheld  in  patients  with  high  IgM  levels.  Fludarabine  (25  mg/m2 
per  d  for  5  days  every  4  weeks)  and  cladribine  (0.1  mg/kg  per  d 
for  7  days  every  4  weeks)  are  also  highly  effective  single  agents. 
With identification of the MYD88 mutation, novel BTK inhibitors 
(acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, and tirabrutinib), inhibitors targeting 
IRAK1/4, and the BCL2 antagonist venetoclax are being explored 
for  the  treatment  of  WM.  Although  HDT  plus  autologous  trans-
plantation is an option, its use has declined due to the availability of 
other effective agents.

POEMS SYNDROME
The  features  of  this  syndrome  are  polyneuropathy,  organomegaly, 
endocrinopathy,  M-protein,  and  skin  changes  (POEMS).  Diagnostic 
criteria  are  described  in  Table  111-1.  Patients  usually  have  a  severe, 
progressive  sensorimotor  polyneuropathy  associated  with  sclerotic 
bone lesions from myeloma. Polyneuropathy occurs in ~1.4% of mye-
lomas, but the POEMS syndrome is only a rare subset of that group. 
Unlike  typical  myeloma,  hepatomegaly  and  lymphadenopathy  occur 
in about two-thirds of patients, and splenomegaly is seen in one-third. 
The  lymphadenopathy  frequently  resembles  Castleman’s  disease  his-
tologically,  a  condition  that  has  been  linked  to  IL-6  overproduction. 
The  endocrine  manifestations  include  amenorrhea  in  women  and 
impotence and gynecomastia in men. Hyperprolactinemia due to loss 
of normal inhibitory control by the hypothalamus may be associated 
with other central nervous system manifestations such as papilledema 
and  elevated  cerebrospinal  fluid  pressure  and  protein.  Type  2  diabe-
tes  mellitus  occurs  in  about  one-third  of  patients.  Hypothyroidism 
and  adrenal  insufficiency  are  occasionally  noted.  Skin  changes  are 
diverse: hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, skin thickening, and dig-
ital clubbing. Other manifestations include peripheral edema, ascites, 
pleural effusions, fever, and thrombocytosis. Not all the components of 
POEMS syndrome may be present initially.

The pathogenesis of the disease is unclear, but high circulating levels 
of  the  proinflammatory  cytokines  IL-1,  IL-6,  VEGF,  and  TNF  have 
been documented, and levels of the inhibitory cytokine transforming 
growth  factor  β  are  lower  than  expected.  Treatment  of  the  myeloma 
may result in an improvement in the other disease manifestations.

Patients are often treated similarly to those with myeloma. Plasma-
pheresis does not appear to be of benefit in POEMS syndrome. Patients 
presenting  with  isolated  sclerotic  lesions  may  have  resolution  of  
neuropathic  symptoms  after  local  therapy  for  plasmacytoma  with 
radiotherapy. Similar to MM, novel agents and HDT with autologous 
stem  cell  transplantation  have  been  pursued  in  selected  patients  and 
have been associated with prolonged progression-free survival.

HEAVY CHAIN DISEASES
The  heavy  chain  diseases  are  rare  lymphoplasmacytic  malignancies. 
Their  clinical  manifestations  vary  with  the  heavy  chain  isotype. 
Patients have absence of light chain and secrete a defective heavy chain 
that usually has an intact Fc fragment and a deletion in the Fd region. 
Gamma,  alpha,  and  mu  heavy  chain  diseases  have  been  described, 
but no reports of delta or epsilon heavy chain diseases have appeared. 
Molecular  biologic  analysis  of  these  tumors  has  revealed  structural 
genetic defects that may account for the aberrant chain secreted.

respiratory  compromise.  The  diagnosis  depends  on  the  demonstra-
tion of an anomalous serum M component (often <20 g/L [<2 g/dL]) 
that  reacts  with  anti-IgG  but  not  anti–light  chain  reagents.  The  M 
component is typically present in both serum and urine. Most of the 
paraproteins  have  been  of  the  γ1  subclass,  but  other  subclasses  have 
been  seen.  The  patients  may  have  thrombocytopenia,  eosinophilia, 
and nondiagnostic bone marrow that may show increased numbers of 
lymphocytes or plasma cells that do not stain for light chain. Patients 
usually  have  a  rapid  downhill  course  and  die  of  infection;  however, 
some  patients  have  survived  5  years  with  chemotherapy.  Therapy  is 
indicated when symptomatic and involves chemotherapeutic combina-
tions used in low-grade lymphoma. Rituximab has also been reported 
to show efficacy.

 ■ ALPHA HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE  
(SELIGMANN’S DISEASE)
This is the most common of the heavy chain diseases. It is closely related 
to  a  malignancy  known  as  Mediterranean  lymphoma,  a  disease  that 
affects young persons in parts of the world where intestinal parasites 
are common, such as the Mediterranean, Asia, and South America. The 
disease is characterized by an infiltration of the lamina propria of the 
small  intestine  with  lymphoplasmacytoid  cells  that  secrete  truncated 
alpha  chains.  Demonstrating  alpha  heavy  chains  is  difficult  because 
the alpha chains tend to polymerize and appear as a smear instead of 
a sharp peak on electrophoretic profiles. Despite the polymerization, 
hyperviscosity is not a common problem in alpha heavy chain disease. 
Without  J  chain–facilitated  dimerization,  viscosity  does  not  increase 
dramatically.  Light  chains  are  absent  from  serum  and  urine.  The 
patients present with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption 
and have extensive mesenteric and paraaortic adenopathy. Respiratory 
tract involvement occurs rarely. Patients may vary widely in their clin-
ical course. Some may develop diffuse aggressive histologies of malig-
nant  lymphoma.  Chemotherapy  may  produce  long-term  remissions. 
Rare  patients  appear  to  have  responded  to  antibiotic  therapy,  raising 
the question of the etiologic role of antigenic stimulation, perhaps by 
some chronic intestinal infection. Chemotherapy plus antibiotics may 
be  more  effective  than  chemotherapy  alone.  IPSID  is  recognized  as 
an infectious pathogen–associated human lymphoma associated with 
Campylobacter jejuni. It involves mainly the proximal small intestine, 
resulting  in  malabsorption,  diarrhea,  and  abdominal  pain.  IPSID  is 
associated  with  excessive  plasma  cell  differentiation  and  produces 
truncated  alpha  heavy  chain  proteins  lacking  the  light  chains  as  well 
as the first constant domain. Early-stage IPSID responds to antibiotics 
(30–70% complete remission). Most untreated IPSID patients progress 
to  lymphoplasmacytic  and  immunoblastic  lymphoma.  Patients  not 
responding  to  antibiotic  therapy  are  considered  for  treatment  with 
combination chemotherapy used to treat low-grade lymphoma.

 ■ MU HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE
The secretion of isolated mu heavy chains into the serum appears to 
occur in a very rare subset of patients with CLL. The only features that 
may distinguish patients with mu heavy chain disease are the presence 
of vacuoles in the malignant lymphocytes and the excretion of kappa 
light chains in the urine. The diagnosis requires ultracentrifugation or 
gel filtration to confirm the nonreactivity of the paraprotein with the 
light chain reagents because some intact macroglobulins fail to interact 
with these serums. The tumor cells seem to have a defect in the assem-
bly of light and heavy chains because they appear to contain both in 
their  cytoplasm.  Such  patients  are  not  treated  differently  from  other 
patients with CLL (Chap. 107).

 ■ GAMMA HEAVY CHAIN DISEASE  
(FRANKLIN’S DISEASE)
This  disease  affects  individuals  of  widely  different  age  groups  and 
countries  of  origin.  It  is  characterized  by  lymphadenopathy,  fever, 
anemia,  malaise,  hepatosplenomegaly,  and  weakness.  It  is  frequently 
associated with autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. 
Its most distinctive symptom is palatal edema, resulting from involve-
ment  of  nodes  in  Waldeyer’s  ring,  and  this  may  progress  to  produce

112 Amyloidosis

John L. Berk, Vaishali Sanchorawala

 ■ GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Amyloidosis  is  the  term  for  a  group  of  protein  misfolding  disorders 
characterized  by  the  extracellular  deposition  of  insoluble  polymeric 
protein fibrils in tissues and organs. A robust cellular machinery exists 
to chaperone proteins during the process of synthesis and secretion, to 
ensure  that  they  achieve  correct  tertiary  conformation  and  function,

and  to  eliminate  proteins  that  misfold.  However,  genetic  mutation, 
incorrect  processing,  and  other  factors  may  favor  misfolding,  with 
consequent loss of normal protein function and intracellular or extra-
cellular  aggregation.  Many  diseases,  ranging  from  cystic  fibrosis  to 
Alzheimer’s  disease,  are  now  known  to  involve  protein  misfolding. 
In the amyloidoses, the aggregates are typically extracellular, and the 
misfolded  protein  subunits  assume  a  common  antiparallel,  β-pleated 
sheet–rich  structural  conformation  that  leads  to  the  formation  of  
higher-order  oligomers  and  then  fibrils  with  unique  staining  prop-
erties.  The  term  amyloid  was  coined  around  1854  by  the  pathologist 
Rudolf  Virchow,  who  thought  that  these  deposits  resembled  starch 
(Latin amylum) under the microscope.

Amyloid  diseases,  defined  by  the  biochemical  nature  of  the  protein 
composing the fibril deposits, are classified according to whether they are 
systemic or localized, whether they are acquired or inherited, and their 
clinical patterns (Table 112-1). The standard nomenclature is AX, where 
A indicates amyloidosis and X represents the protein present in the fibril. 
This chapter focuses primarily on the systemic forms. AL refers to amyloid 
composed of immunoglobulin light chains (LCs); this disorder, formerly 
termed primary systemic amyloidosis, arises from a clonal B-cell or plasma 
cell disorder and can be associated with myeloma or lymphoma. ATTR, 
the most prevalent of the familial amyloidoses, refers to amyloid derived 
from wild-type or mutated transthyretin (TTR), the transport protein for 
thyroid hormone and retinol-binding protein. AA amyloid is composed 
of the acute-phase reactant protein serum amyloid A (SAA) and occurs in 
the setting of chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases; for this reason, 
this type was formerly known as secondary amyloidosis. Aβ2M amyloid  
results from misfolded β2-microglobulin, occurring in individuals with 
long-standing  renal  disease  who  have  undergone  dialysis,  typically  for 
years. Aβ, the most common form of localized amyloidosis, is found in 
the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease after abnormal proteolytic 
processing  and  aggregation  of  polypeptides  derived  from  the  amyloid 
precursor protein.

Diagnosis  and  treatment  of  the  amyloidoses  rest  upon  the  his-
topathologic  identification  of  amyloid  deposits  and  immunohis-
tochemical,  biochemical,  or  genetic  determination  of  amyloid  type  
(Fig.  112-1).  In  the  systemic  amyloidoses,  the  clinically  involved

organs  can  be  biopsied,  but  amyloid  deposits  may  be  found  in  any 
tissue  of  the  body.  Historically,  blood  vessels  of  the  gingiva  or  rectal 
mucosa  were  often  examined,  but  the  most  easily  accessible  tissue—
positive  in  more  than  80%  of  patients  with  systemic  amyloidosis—is 
abdominal fat. After local anesthesia, fat is aspirated with a 16-gauge 
needle from the subcutaneous layer of the abdominal wall. Fat globules 
expelled  onto  a  glass  slide  can  be  stained  for  amyloid,  thus  avoiding 
a surgical procedure. If this material is negative, more invasive biop-
sies of the kidney, heart, liver, tongue, or gastrointestinal tract can be 
considered in patients in whom amyloidosis is suspected. The regular 
β-sheet structure of amyloid deposits exhibits a unique “apple green” 
birefringence by polarized light microscopy when stained with Congo 
red dye; other regular protein structures (e.g., collagen) appear white 
under these conditions. The 10-nm-diameter fibrils can also be visu-
alized by electron microscopy of paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue. Once 
amyloid  is  found,  the  precursor  protein  type  must  be  determined  by 
immunohistochemistry,  immunoelectron  microscopy,  or  extraction 
and biochemical analysis employing mass spectrometry; gene sequenc-
ing  is  used  to  identify  mutants  causing  hereditary  amyloidosis.  The 
patient’s history, physical findings, and clinical presentation, including 
age and ethnic origin, organ system involvement, underlying diseases, 
and family history, may provide helpful clues as to the type of amyloi-
dosis.  However,  there  can  be  considerable  overlap  in  clinical  presen-
tations, and accurate typing is essential to guide appropriate therapy.

The mechanisms of fibril formation and tissue toxicity remain contro-
versial. The “amyloid hypothesis,” as it is currently understood, proposes 
that  precursor  proteins  undergo  a  process  of  reversible  unfolding  or 
misfolding; misfolded proteins form oligomeric aggregates, higher-order 
polymers, and then fibrils that deposit in tissues. Accumulating evidence 
suggests that the oligomeric intermediates may constitute the most toxic 
species.  Oligomers  are  more  capable  than  large  fibrils  of  interacting

The clinical syndromes of the amyloidoses are 
associated with relatively nonspecific alterations 
in  routine  laboratory  tests.  Blood  counts  are 
usually  normal,  although  the  erythrocyte  sed-
imentation  rate  is  frequently  elevated.  Patients 
with  glomerular  kidney  involvement  gener-
ally  have  proteinuria,  often  in  the  nephrotic 
range,  leading  to  hypoalbuminemia  that  may 
be  severe;  patients  with  serum  albumin  levels  
<2 g/dL generally have pedal edema or anasarca. 
Amyloid  cardiomyopathy  is  characterized  by 
concentric  ventricular  hypertrophy  and  dia-
stolic  dysfunction  associated  with  elevation  of 
brain  natriuretic  peptide  (BNP)  or  N-terminal 
pro–brain  natriuretic  peptide  (NT-proBNP)  as 
well as troponin. These cardiac biomarkers can 
be  used  for  disease  staging,  prognostication, 
and disease activity monitoring in patients with 
AL  amyloidosis.  Notably,  renal  insufficiency 
can  falsely  elevate  levels  of  these  biomarkers. 
Recently,  biomarkers  of  cardiac  remodeling—
that  is,  matrix  metalloproteinases  and  tissue 
inhibitors  of  metalloproteinases—have  been 
found to be altered in the serum of patients with 
amyloid  cardiomyopathy.  Electrocardiographic 
and  echocardiographic  features  of  amyloid  car-
diomyopathy are described below. Patients with 
liver involvement, even when advanced, usually 
develop  cholestasis  with  an  elevated  alkaline 
phosphatase concentration with minimal altera-
tion  of  the  aminotransferases  and  preservation 
of  synthetic  function.  In  AL  amyloidosis,  endocrine  organs  may  be 
infiltrated with fibrils, and hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, or even 
hypopituitarism can occur. Although none of these findings is specific 
for amyloidosis, the presence of abnormalities in multiple organ sys-
tems should raise suspicions of the diagnosis.

 ■ AL AMYLOIDOSIS
Etiology  and  Incidence  AL  amyloidosis  is  most  frequently 
caused by a clonal expansion of bone marrow plasma cells that secrete 
a monoclonal immunoglobulin LC depositing as amyloid fibrils in tis-
sues. Whether the clonal plasma cells produce a LC that misfolds and 
leads to AL amyloidosis or an LC that folds properly, allowing the cells 
to  inexorably  expand  over  time  and  develop  into  multiple  myeloma 
(Chap.  111),  may  depend  upon  primary  sequence  of  the  clonal  LC 
or other genetic or epigenetic factors. AL amyloidosis can occur with 
multiple  myeloma  or  other  B  lymphoproliferative  diseases,  including 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Chap. 108) and Waldenström’s macroglob-
ulinemia  (Chap.  111).  AL  amyloidosis  is  the  most  common  type  of 
systemic  amyloidosis  diagnosed  in  North  America.  Its  incidence  has 
been  estimated  at  4.5  cases/100,000  population;  however,  ascertain-
ment continues to be inadequate, and the true incidence may be much 
higher. AL amyloidosis, like other plasma cell disorders, usually occurs 
after age 40 and is often progressive and fatal if untreated.

Pathology  and  Clinical  Features  Amyloid  deposits  are  usually 
widespread in AL amyloidosis and can be present in the interstitium of 
any organ outside the central nervous system. The amyloid fibril depos-
its are composed of full-length 23-kDa monoclonal immunoglobulin 
LCs as well as fragments. Accessory molecules co-deposited with LC 
fibrils  (as  well  as  with  other  amyloid  fibrils)  include  serum  amyloid 
P  component,  apolipoproteins  e  and  A-IV,  glycosaminoglycans,  and

metal  ions.  Although  all  kappa  and  lambda  LC  subtypes  have  been 
identified  in  AL  amyloid  fibrils,  lambda  subtypes  predominate.  The 
lambda  6  subtype  appears  to  have  unique  structural  properties  that 
predispose it to fibril formation, often in the kidney.

AL amyloidosis is often a rapidly progressive disease that presents as 
a pleiotropic set of clinical syndromes, recognition of which is key for 
initiation of the appropriate workup. Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue 
and weight loss are common; however, the diagnosis is rarely consid-
ered until symptoms referable to a specific organ develop. The kidneys 
are the most frequently involved organ and are affected in 70–80% of 
patients.  Renal  amyloidosis  usually  manifests  as  proteinuria,  often  in 
the nephrotic range and associated with hypoalbuminemia, secondary 
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and edema or anasarca. 
In some patients, interstitial rather than glomerular amyloid deposition 
can  produce  azotemia  without  proteinuria.  The  heart  is  the  second 
most  commonly  affected  organ  (50–60%  of  patients),  and  cardiac 
involvement is the leading cause of death from AL amyloidosis. Early 
on, the electrocardiogram may show low voltage in the limb leads with 
a pseudo-infarct pattern. Echocardiographic features of disease include 
concentrically  thickened  ventricles  and  diastolic  dysfunction  with  an 
abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  pattern;  a  “sparkly”  appearance 
has been described but is often not seen with modern high-resolution 
echocardiographic  techniques.  Poor  atrial  contractility  occurs  even 
in sinus rhythm, and patients with cardiac amyloidosis are at risk for 
development  of  atrial  thrombi  and  stroke.  Cardiac  MRI  can  show 
increased wall thickness, and characteristic delayed enhancement of the 
subendocardium has been described following injection of gadolinium 
contrast.  Nervous  system  symptoms  include  peripheral  sensorimotor 
neuropathy and/or autonomic dysfunction manifesting as gastrointes-
tinal  motility  disturbances  (early  satiety,  diarrhea,  constipation),  dry 
eyes  and  mouth,  impotence,  orthostatic  hypotension,  and/or  neuro-
genic  bladder.  Macroglossia  (Fig.  112-2A),  a  pathognomonic  sign  of 
AL  amyloidosis,  is  seen  in  only  ~10%  of  patients.  Liver  involvement 
causes cholestasis and hepatomegaly. The spleen is frequently involved, 
and there may be functional hyposplenism in the absence of significant 
splenomegaly. Many patients experience “easy bruising” due to amyloid 
deposits in capillaries or deficiency of clotting factor X due to binding to 
amyloid fibrils; cutaneous ecchymoses appear, particularly around the 
eyes, producing another uncommon but pathognomonic finding, the 
“raccoon-eye” sign (Fig. 112-2B). Other findings include nail dystro-
phy (Fig. 112-2C), alopecia, and amyloid arthropathy with thickening 
of synovial membranes in the wrists and shoulders. The presence of a 
multisystemic illness or general fatigue along with any of these clinical 
syndromes should prompt a workup for amyloidosis.

Identification  of  an  underlying  clonal  plasma  cell  or  B 
lymphoproliferative process and a clonal LC are key to the diagnosis 
of  AL  amyloidosis.  Serum  protein  electrophoresis  and  urine  protein 
electrophoresis, although of value in multiple myeloma, are not useful 
screening  tests  if  AL  amyloidosis  is  suspected  because  the  clonal  LC 
or  whole  immunoglobulin  often  is  not  present  in  sufficient  amounts 
to produce a monoclonal “M-spike” in the serum or LC (Bence Jones) 
protein in the urine. However, more than 90% of patients with AL amy-
loidosis have serum or urine monoclonal LC or whole immunoglobulin 

detectable by immunofixation electrophoresis of serum (SIFE) or urine 
(UIFE)  (Fig.  112-3A)  or  by  nephelometric  measurement  of  serum 
“free” LCs (i.e., LCs circulating in monomeric form rather than in an 
immunoglobulin  tetramer  with  heavy  chain).  Examining  the  ratio  as 
well  as  the  absolute  amount  of  serum-free  LCs  is  essential,  as  renal 
insufficiency  reduces  LC  clearance,  nonspecifically  elevating  both 
isotypes.  In  addition,  an  increased  percentage  of  plasma  cells  in  the 
bone marrow—typically 5–30% of nucleated cells—is found in ~90% 
of patients. Kappa or lambda clonality should be demonstrated by flow 
cytometry,  immunohistochemistry,  or  in  situ  hybridization  for  LC 
mRNA (Fig. 112-3B).

A monoclonal serum protein by itself is not diagnostic of amyloido-
sis, since monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance is common 
in older patients (Chap. 111). However, when monoclonal gammopathy 
of uncertain significance is found in patients with biopsy-proven amy-
loidosis, the AL type should be ruled out. Similarly, patients thought to 
have “smoldering myeloma” because of a modest elevation of bone-mar-
row  plasma  cells  should  be  screened  for  AL  amyloidosis  if  they  have 
signs  or  symptoms  of  renal,  cardiac,  or  neurologic  disease.  Accurate 
tissue amyloid typing is essential for appropriate treatment. Immunohis-
tochemical staining of the amyloid deposits is useful if they selectively 
bind  one  LC  antibody  in  preference  to  the  other;  some  AL  deposits 
bind  antibodies  nonspecifically.  Immunoelectron  microscopy  is  more 
reliable; laser capture microdissection and tandem mass spectrometry–
based typing of the amyloid precursor protein has become the diagnos-
tic standard. In ambiguous cases, other forms of amyloidosis should be 
thoroughly excluded with appropriate genetic and other testing.

Staging System and Risk Stratification  The current staging sys-
tems for systemic AL amyloidosis are based on the biomarkers of plasma 
cell dyscrasia and cardiac and renal involvement. The Mayo 2004 staging 
system is based on the levels of NT-proBNP and cardiac troponins and 
was  modified  by  European  investigators  to  identify  and  classify  very-
high-risk patients. This cardiac staging system is the most widely used to 
determine patient management. This staging system was modified (Mayo 
2012)  to  include  clonal  burden,  assessed  by  dFLC  (difference  between 
involved  and  uninvolved  circulating  free  light  chain)  concentration, 
which  has  independent  ability  to  predict  survival.  Boston  University 
investigators  introduced  a  staging  system  incorporating  BNP  and  tro-
ponin I that also is able to predict survival. Patients with AL amyloidosis 
with a very low (<50 mg/L) dFLC level have a significantly better outcome 
irrespective of cardiac stage. A renal staging system based on 24-h urine 
protein  excretion  and  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR)  pre-
dicting the progression to dialysis at 2 years has also been developed and 
validated. Several other biomarkers have been shown to predict outcomes 
and survival but have not been incorporated in staging systems yet.

TREATMENT
AL Amyloidosis

Extensive multisystemic involvement typifies AL amyloidosis, and 
the  median  survival  period  without  treatment  is  usually  only   
~1–2 years from the time of diagnosis. Current therapies target the

clonal  bone  marrow  plasma  cells,  using  approaches  employed  for 
multiple myeloma. Treatment with oral melphalan and prednisone 
can  decrease  the  plasma  cell  burden  but  rarely  leads  to  complete 
hematologic  remission,  meaningful  organ  responses,  or  improved 
survival  and  is  no  longer  widely  used.  The  substitution  of  dex-
amethasone  for  prednisone  produces  a  higher  response  rate  and 
more  durable  remissions,  although  dexamethasone  is  not  always 
well tolerated by patients with significant edema or cardiac disease. 
High-dose  intravenous  (IV)  melphalan  followed  by  autologous 
stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) produces complete hemato-
logic responses in ~40% of treated patients, as determined by loss 
of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and disappearance of the 
amyloidogenic  monoclonal  LC,  as  determined  by  SIFE/UIFE  and 
free  LC  quantitation.  Six  to  12  months  after  achieving  a  hemato-
logic response, improvements in organ function and quality of life 
may occur. Hematologic responses appear to be more durable after 
HDM/SCT than in multiple myeloma, with remissions continuing 
in  some  patients  beyond  15  years  without  additional  treatment. 
Unfortunately,  only  ~20–30%  of  all  AL  amyloidosis  patients  are 
suitable  for  aggressive  treatment,  and  even  at  specialized  treat-
ment  centers,  transplantation-related  mortality  rates  are  higher 
than  those  for  other  hematologic  diseases  because  of  impaired 
organ  function  at  initial  presentation.  Amyloid  cardiomyopathy, 
poor  nutritional  and  performance  status,  and  multiorgan  disease 
contribute to excess morbidity and mortality. A bleeding diathesis 

resulting from adsorption of clotting factor X to amyloid fibrils also 
increases  mortality  rates;  however,  this  syndrome  occurs  in  only 
5–10%  of  patients.  A  randomized  multicenter  trial  conducted  in 
France compared oral melphalan and dexamethasone with HDM/
SCT  and  failed  to  show  a  benefit  of  dose-intensive  treatment, 
although the transplantation-related mortality rate in this study was 
very high. It has become clear that careful selection of patients and 
expert  peritransplantation  management  are  essential  in  reducing 
transplantation-related mortality.

For patients with AL amyloidosis and impaired cardiac function 
or arrhythmias due to involvement of the myocardium, the median 
survival  period  is  only  ~6  months  without  treatment.  In  these 
patients, cardiac transplantation can be performed and followed by 
HDM/SCT to eliminate the noxious LC clone and prevent amyloid 
deposition in the transplanted heart or other organs.

The  best  therapy  for  those  who  are  transplant  ineligible  varies 
between  centers  and  countries.  A  regimen  of  oral  chemotherapy 
with melphalan and dexamethasone (MDex) had been the standard 
for  patients  not  eligible  for  HDM/SCT  for  more  than  a  decade. 
Regimens using bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor) are now con-
sidered the standard of care in most patients with AL amyloidosis 
not eligible for SCT. There is a fine balance between chosen treat-
ment  regimens  and  toxicities,  and  patient  characteristics  should 
be  considered  when  choosing  a  regimen;  for  example,  treatment 
with bortezomib plus MDex can overcome the effects of both gain

of  1q21  (which  confers  a  poorer  outcome  with  oral  melphalan) 
and  t(11;14)  (which  confers  a  poorer  outcome  with  bortezomib). 
Transplant-ineligible  patients  in  whom  bortezomib  is  contraindi-
cated due to preexisting peripheral neuropathy can be treated with 
MDex or combinations based on immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., 
lenalidomide). High-risk patients represent ~20% of all individuals 
with AL amyloidosis and are a challenge owing to advanced cardiac 
stage  (IIIb)  or  severe  heart  failure  (New  York  Heart  Association 
class III or IV).

Newer  agents,  such  as  the  oral  proteasome  inhibitor  ixazomib 
and the humanized anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab, 
have  also  been  evaluated  in  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory 
disease.  Anti-fibril  small  molecules  and  humanized  monoclonal 
antibodies  are  also  being  tested.  Clinical  trials  are  essential  in 
improving therapy for this rare disease.

Supportive care is important for patients with any type of amyloi-
dosis. For nephrotic syndrome, diuretics and supportive stockings 
can  ameliorate  edema;  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors 
should be used with caution and have not been shown to slow renal 
disease progression. Effective diuresis can be facilitated with albu-
min  infusions  to  raise  intravascular  oncotic  pressure.  Congestive 
heart  failure  due  to  amyloid  cardiomyopathy  is  best  treated  with 
diuretics;  it  is  important  to  note  that  digitalis,  calcium  channel 
blockers,  and  beta  blockers  are  relatively  contraindicated  as  they 
can interact with amyloid fibrils and produce heart block and wors-
ening heart failure. Amiodarone has been used for atrial and ven-
tricular  arrhythmias.  Automatic  implantable  defibrillators  appear 
to  have  reduced  effectiveness  due  to  the  thickened  myocardium, 
but they may benefit some patients. Atrial ablation is an effective 
approach for atrial fibrillation. For conduction abnormalities, ven-
tricular pacing may be indicated. Atrial contractile dysfunction is 
common in amyloid cardiomyopathy and associated with increased 
thromboembolic complications, prompting considerations of anti-
coagulation  even  in  the  absence  of  atrial  fibrillation.  Autonomic 
neuropathy  can  be  treated  with  α  agonists  such  as  midodrine  to 
support postural blood pressure; gastrointestinal dysfunction may 
respond  to  motility  or  bulk  agents.  Nutritional  supplementation, 
either oral or parenteral, is also important.

In localized AL amyloidosis, amyloid deposits can be produced 
by clonal plasma cells infiltrating local sites in the airways, bladder, 
skin, or lymph nodes (Table 112-1). These deposits may respond to 
surgical intervention or elimination of the responsible plasma cell 
clone by low-dose radiation therapy (typically only 20 Gy); systemic 
treatment generally is not appropriate. Patients should be referred 
to a center familiar with management of these rare manifestations 
of amyloidosis.

 ■ AA AMYLOIDOSIS
Etiology and Incidence  AA amyloidosis can occur in association 
with almost any chronic inflammatory state (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, familial Mediterra-
nean fever [Chap. 369], or other periodic fever syndromes) or chronic 
infections  such  as  tuberculosis,  osteomyelitis,  or  subacute  bacterial 
endocarditis.  In  the  United  States  and  Europe,  AA  amyloidosis  has 
become less common, occurring in fewer than 2% of patients with these 
diseases,  presumably  because  of  advances  in  anti-inflammatory  and 
antimicrobial therapies. It has also been described in association with 
Castleman’s disease, lymphomas, and renal cell carcinoma, emphasizing 
the diagnostic importance of CT scanning to look for such tumors as 
well as serologic and microbiologic studies. In up to 30% of patients, AA 
amyloidosis can also be seen without any identifiable underlying disease. 
AA is the most frequent systemic amyloidosis that occurs in children.

Pathology  and  Clinical  Features  Organ  involvement  in  AA 
amyloidosis usually begins in the kidneys. Hepatomegaly, splenomeg-
aly, and autonomic neuropathy can also occur as the disease progresses; 
cardiomyopathy is a late manifestation in ~25% of patients. The symp-
toms  and  signs  of  AA  disease  cannot  be  reliably  distinguished  from 

those of AL amyloidosis. AA amyloid fibrils are usually composed of 
an 8-kDa, 76-amino-acid N-terminal portion of the 12-kDa precursor 
protein  SAA.  This  acute-phase  apoprotein  is  synthesized  in  the  liver 
and  transported  by  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL3)  in  the  plasma. 
Several years of an underlying inflammatory disease causing chronic 
elevation  of  SAA  levels  usually  precede  fibril  formation,  although 
infections can lead to AA amyloid deposition more rapidly.

TREATMENT
AA Amyloidosis

Primary  therapy  for  AA  amyloidosis  consists  of  treatment  of  the 
underlying inflammatory or infectious disease. Treatment that sup-
presses or eliminates the inflammatory state or infection decreases 
the  SAA  concentration,  slowing  the  rate  of  amyloid  fibril  for-
mation.  For  familial  Mediterranean  fever,  colchicine  at  a  dose  of   
1.2–1.8 mg/d is the standard treatment. However, colchicine has not 
been helpful for AA amyloidosis of other causes or for other amy-
loidoses. Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 
antagonists can effectively interrupt cytokine signaling that drives 
many inflammatory syndromes, inhibiting hepatic SAA production 
and  limiting  AA  amyloid  deposition.  Development  of  a  fibril- 
specific  agent  (eprodisate)  that  interferes  with  the  interaction  of 
serum  amyloid  A  protein  and  glycosaminoglycans  to  prevent  or 
disrupt fibril formation failed in phase 3 trials.

 ■ ATTR AND AF AMYLOIDOSIS
The  familial  amyloidoses  are  autosomal  dominant  diseases  in  which 
mutated or variant plasma proteins misfold or aggregate to form beta-
sheet rich amyloid deposits. These diseases are rare, with an estimated 
case incidence of <1/100,000 population in the United States, although 
founder  effects  in  remote  areas  of  Portugal,  Sweden,  and  Japan  pro-
duced  a  higher  local  prevalence  of  disease.  The  most  prevalent  form 
of hereditary amyloidosis arises from mutation of the abundant liver- 
derived plasma protein transthyretin (TTR, also known as prealbumin) 
and is termed hATTR amyloid. More than 130 TTR mutations typically 
conferring  one-amino-acid  substitutions  have  been  described,  with 
most  inducing  clinical  ATTR  amyloid  disease.  Toxic  TTR  oligomers 
and ATTR amyloid deposits target peripheral and autonomic nervous 
systems and the heart. One TTR variant, V122I, occurs in nearly 4% 
of  the  African-American  and  Afro-Caribbean  populations  and  is 
associated  with  late-onset  cardiac  amyloidosis.  The  actual  incidence 
and penetrance of disease in the African-American population is the 
subject of ongoing research, but considerations of V122I ATTR amy-
loidosis is warranted in African-American patients who present with 
concentric cardiac hypertrophy and evidence of diastolic heart failure, 
particularly  in  the  absence  of  a  history  of  hypertension  or  valvular 
disease. Other familial amyloidoses, caused by variant apolipoproteins 
AI or AII, gelsolin, fibrinogen Aα, or lysozyme, are reported with lower 
prevalence  worldwide.  New  amyloidogenic  serum  proteins  continue 
to  be  identified  periodically,  including  leukocyte  chemotactic  factor 
LECT2, which is a cause of renal amyloidosis in Hispanic and Pakistani 
populations. Although the clustering of ALECT2 cases suggests herita-
bility, no LECT2 gene-coding sequence variations have been identified.
Normal  (wild-type)  transthyretin  can  also  misfold  and  aggregate 
to  form  ATTR  amyloid,  typically  expressed  in  men  beginning  in  the 
seventh decade with increasing prevalence with age. Formerly termed 
senile systemic amyloidosis, ATTRwt amyloid is reported at autopsy in 
25% of hearts from patients who are 80 years and older. Although it is 
unclear  why  a  wild-type  protein  becomes  amyloidogenic,  aging  inef-
ficiencies  of  intracellular  quality-assurance  mechanisms  (termed  the 
unfolded  protein  response)  likely  predispose  to  secretion  of  proteins 
prone to misaggregation. Due to the numbers of aging men globally, 
ATTRwt is the most prevalent and rapidly growing form of amyloidosis 
in the world today.

Clinical Features and Diagnosis  hATTR amyloidosis has a var-
ied presentation predicted by the specific TTR mutation. Consequently,

kindreds  typically  express  similar  disease  timing  and  clinical  course. 
Apparent  sporadic  presentations  (no  recognized  family  history)  often 
reflect  incomplete  penetrance  of  the  TTR  mutation  and  not  a  spon-
taneous  event.  hATTR  amyloidosis  presents  as  familial  amyloidotic 
polyneuropathy (nerve damage) or familial amyloidotic cardiomyopa-
thy (heart damage). Peripheral neuropathy begins as a length-dependent 
small-fiber  sensorimotor  neuropathy  first  exhibited  in  the  feet  with 
ascending  progression  to  the  upper  extremities.  Autonomic  neurop-
athy  manifests  as  smooth  muscle  dysmotility  (dysphagia,  diarrhea, 
urinary  retention),  vascular  dysregulation  (orthostatic  hypotension, 
erectile dysfunction), and anhidrosis. Soft tissue disease (carpal tunnel 
syndrome,  tendonopathy,  and  spinal  stenosis)  commonly  precedes 
nerve or heart manifestations of disease by 1–2 decades, particularly in 
ATTRwt amyloid patients who frequently report bicipital, patellar, or 
Achilles tendon rupture. Less common expressions of hATTR include 
vitreous opacities and leptomeningeal amyloid deposition from variant 
protein produced by the retinal epithelium and choroid plexus, respec-
tively. ATTR amyloid involvement of the heart is clinically better tol-
erated than AL amyloid cardiomyopathy as reflected by the time from 
heart failure presentation to death in untreated cases of ATTR (median 
42–48  months)  versus  AL  (median  6  months)  amyloidosis  and  the 
dramatically greater burden of disease by echocardiographic measures 
at symptomatic presentation.

Typical  syndromes  associated  with  other  forms  of  AF  disease 
include renal amyloidosis with mutant fibrinogen, lysozyme, or apoli-
poproteins; hepatic amyloidosis with apolipoprotein AI; and amyloido-
sis of cranial neuropathy with corneal lattice dystrophy pathognomonic 
of gelsolin amyloidosis. Patients with AF amyloidosis can present with 
clinical syndromes that mimic those of patients with AL disease. Rarely, 
AF carriers can develop AL disease or AF patients may have monoclo-
nal gammopathy without AL. Thus, it is important to screen both for 
plasma cell disorders and for mutations in patients with amyloidosis. 
Although mass spectrometry often detects amino acid sequence vari-
ations, it is not designed to definitively identify specific protein varia-
tions; DNA sequencing is the diagnostic standard for AF mutations.

TREATMENT
ATTR Amyloidosis

Untreated,  the  survival  period  after  onset  of  ATTR  disease  is   
5–15  years.  At  present,  three  therapeutic  strategies  are  used  for 
ATTR  amyloidosis:  (1)  orthotopic  liver  transplantation  (OLT)  to 
replace  the  factory  of  the  mutated  protein  (only  applicable  to 
hATTR); (2) stabilization of circulating TTR tetramers, preventing 
TTR monomer release and amyloid fibril formation; and (3) TTR 
gene  silencing  (RNA  interference  or  anti-sense  oligonucleotide 
agents),  suppressing  hepatic  TTR  production  to  eliminate  ATTR 
fibril formation. After 30 years of experience, OLT is largely limited 
to patients with hATTR amyloid and early peripheral neuropathy 
(V30M ATTR), as most patients with non-V30M TTR mutations 
suffer post-transplant progressive amyloid disease due to wild-type 
TTR  from  the  allograft  liver  depositing  on  preexisting  amyloid 
present in the heart and nerves. TTR tetramer stabilization success-
fully  inhibits  progressive  ATTR  amyloid  nerve  and  heart  disease 
as  demonstrated  by  a  phase  3  randomized  controlled  trial—the 
Diflunisal Trial (hATTR)—and the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Car-
diomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), respectively. Diflunisal, a 
repurposed generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, and tafamidis, a 
proprietary thyroxine mimetic, bind TTR tetramers at the thyroxine 
binding site, minimizing release of the amyloidogenic TTR mono-
mer and slowing progression of nerve and heart disease. Tafamidis, 
the  first  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration–approved  treatment 
for ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy, extends survival and slows the 
decline in walking capacities and quality of life but does not appear 
to induce improvement in heart thickening or function. TTR gene 
silencers more reliably stop neurologic disease progression and, in 
35–60% of treated patients with hATTR amyloid, improve sensory 
nerve  deficits,  a  novel  finding.  Further,  preliminary  data  suggest 

TTR  gene  silencers  may  promote  heart  remodeling  and  improve 
systolic function.

The therapeutic future of ATTR amyloid patients is bright. Phase 
3  randomized  controlled  clinical  trials  examining  the  safety  and 
effectiveness of TTR gene silencers in patients with ATTR amyloid 
cardiomyopathy  are  underway,  as  are  studies  to  determine  the 
impact  of  second-generation  TTR  gene  silencers  on  ATTR  amy-
loid neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. TTR gene editing to prevent 
mRNA production or correct DNA mutations is the next frontier. 
Finally, as survival improves for patients with ATTR amyloid, ther-
apies that cross the blood-brain barrier to address leptomeningeal 
(brain)  and  vitreous  (eye)  amyloid  deposition  arising  from  the 
choroid  plexus  and  retinal  epithelium,  respectively,  will  be  chal-
lenges to achieve.

 ■ Aa2M AMYLOIDOSIS
Aβ2M  amyloid  is  composed  of  β2-microglobulin,  the  invariant  chain 
of  class  I  human  leukocyte  antigens,  and  produces  rheumatologic 
manifestations  in  patients  undergoing  long-term  hemodialysis  and, 
rarely, in patients with a hereditary form of disease. β2-Microglobulin 
is excreted by the kidney, and levels become elevated in end-stage renal 
disease. The molecular mass of β2M is 11.8 kDa—above the cutoff of 
some dialysis membranes. The incidence of this disease appears to be 
declining with the use of newer membranes in high-flow dialysis tech-
niques. Aβ2M amyloidosis usually presents as carpal tunnel syndrome, 
persistent joint effusions, spondyloarthropathy, or cystic bone lesions. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome is often the first symptom. In the past, persis-
tent joint effusions accompanied by mild discomfort were found in up 
to 50% of patients who had undergone dialysis for >12 years. Involve-
ment is bilateral, and large joints (shoulders, knees, wrists, and hips) 
are  most  frequently  affected.  The  synovial  fluid  is  noninflammatory, 
and β2M amyloid can be found if the sediment is stained with Congo 
red.  Although  less  common,  visceral  β2M  amyloid  deposits  do  occa-
sionally occur in the gastrointestinal tract, heart, tendons, and subcu-
taneous tissues of the buttocks. There are no proven specific therapies 
for Aβ2M amyloidosis, but cessation of dialysis after renal allografting 
may lead to symptomatic improvement.
 ■ THERAPEUTIC FRONTIERS
To  date,  treatment  strategies  have  focused  on  limiting  formation  of 
amyloidogenic  proteins.  Disruption  of  existing  amyloid  by  targeting 
ubiquitous components of the tissue deposits offers theoretical means 
to improving major end-organ function; however, clinical trial valida-
tion remains elusive.

SUMMARY
A  diagnosis  of  amyloidosis  should  be  considered  in  patients  with 
unexplained nephropathy, cardiomyopathy (particularly with diastolic 
dysfunction),  neuropathy  (either  peripheral  or  autonomic),  enterop-
athy,  or  the  pathognomonic  soft  tissue  findings  of  macroglossia  or 
periorbital ecchymoses. Pathologic identification of amyloid fibrils can 
be made with Congo red staining of aspirated abdominal fat or of an 
involved-organ biopsy specimen. Accurate typing by a combination of 
immunologic,  biochemical,  and  genetic  testing  is  essential  in  select-
ing appropriate therapy (Fig. 112-1). Systemic amyloidosis should be 
considered  a  treatable  condition,  as  anti–plasma  cell  chemotherapy 
is  highly  effective  in  AL  disease  and  targeted  therapies  are  being 
developed  for  AA  and  ATTR  disease.  The  combination  of  precursor 
and end-organ amyloid therapeutics potentially provide not only dis-
ease  control  but  also  functional  and  quality  of  life  improvements  for 
patients with amyloidosis. Tertiary referral centers can provide special-
ized diagnostic techniques and access to clinical trials for patients with 
these rare diseases.

113 Transfusion Therapy  
and Biology
Pierre Tiberghien, Olivier Garraud,  
Jacques Chiaroni

Transfusion encompasses the use of blood components (BCs) to pre-
vent or treat anemia, hemorrhage, and bleeding disorders. Occasion-
ally, BCs may be used to treat infection or relapse of malignant blood 
diseases after allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. BCs comprise 
mainly  red  blood  cell  concentrates  (RBCCs),  platelet  concentrates 
(PCs), and plasma for transfusion use (as opposed to plasma for frac-
tionation into medicinal products such as albumin and immunoglob-
ulin).  Alongside  transfusion  safety,  ensuring  BC  quality,  assessing  in 
vivo efficacy, and promoting evidence-based transfusion practices are 
critical aspects of transfusion medicine.

Blood collection and donor medicine do not fall within the scope of 
this chapter. Although the processes used are particularly safe, blood 
donations can cause adverse reactions, among which are fainting reac-
tions  and  iron  deficiency.  These  risks  require  preventive  approaches 
and appropriate treatment when needed.

BLOOD COMPONENTS
BC collection and manufacturing processes are described in Table 113-1. 
Most common BCs are collected as whole blood or directly as compo-
nents by apheresis. The vast majority of BCs are homologous. Autol-
ogous  BCs,  sometimes  collected  ahead  of  planned  surgery,  are  now 
exceptional as they present little to no evidence-based advantage over 
homologous BCs. Nevertheless, such donation may still be of benefit in 
the presence of a rare blood group phenotype.

All BCs comply with common quality and performance standards 
and guidelines. Quality assurance encompasses well-defined process-
ing steps and stringent BC quality controls as defined by health author-
ities. Tracing of all manufacturing steps as well as hemovigilance-based 
reporting of adverse events and incidents associated with blood collec-
tion, BC processing, and transfusion are highly recommended.

With the obvious exception of granulocyte concentrates and mono-
nuclear  cells,  the  majority  of  BCs  are  now  leukocyte-reduced,  and 
universal  prestorage  leukocyte  reduction  has  been  recommended. 
These  BCs  contain  <1–5.106  donor  leukocytes  and  are  associated 
with  reduced  incidence  febrile  nonhemolytic  transfusion  reactions 
(FNHTRs), infections with intracellular pathogens such as cytomega-
lovirus (CMV), alloimmunization, and immunomodulation.

BCs  may  undergo  additional  processing  steps.  These  may  include 
irradiation to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in immuno-
suppressed patients, pathogen reduction to further reduce the risk of 
transfusion-transmitted infections, plasma reduction in patients with 

severe allergic reactions to BCs, or the manufacturing of pediatric units 
for young children and neonates.

BC constituents undergo centrifugation and filtration and are placed 
in contact with needles, plastic tubing and bags, as well anticoagulant 
molecules  and  various  additive  solutions.  BCs  are  subjected  to  gas 
exchanges  that  are  significantly  different  from  aerobic  breathing  and 
are maintained at temperatures that are not physiologic, such as 22°C 
or  4°C.  Any  of  these  elements  may  contribute  to  so-called  “storage 
lesions” that may occur at any time during BC processing and storage. 
Some of these lesions have proven to be reversible in the recipient after 
transfusion, while others may be irreversible. The clinical impacts of 
such lesions are under investigation. Storage lesions may also account 
for a number of adverse transfusion reactions, although there is cur-
rently no consensus on this issue.

Furthermore,  plasma  present  in  BCs  contains  donor  antibodies 
(Abs). When directed toward antigens (Ags) present in the recipient, 
such as blood group or tissue (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]) Ags, 
such  Abs  may  result  in  adverse  events.  RBCCs  bring  only  a  limited 
amount  of  donor  plasma  (10–30  mL),  unlike  PCs  and  obviously 
plasma. The use of platelet additive solution can replace two-thirds of 
plasma in PCs, while still leaving the equivalent of one plasma unit of 
200 mL per transfused PC.
BLOOD GROUP ANTIGENS AND 
ANTIBODIES
Red blood cells, as well as other blood constituents such as platelets and 
neutrophils, express allogeneic determinants. Transfusion may there-
fore  result  in  alloimmunization  and  the  production  of  Abs  directed 
against allogeneic determinants. These alloantibodies (alloAbs) com-
prise  anti-red  blood  cell  (RBC)  Abs,  anti-HLA,  anti-human  platelet 
Ag (HPA) Abs, and anti-human neutrophil Ag (HNA) Abs. Anti-RBC 
immunization  may  result  in  hemolysis,  while  anti-HLA  or  anti-HPA 
Abs  may  result  in  other  transfusion  complications  such  as  fever  and 
platelet  transfusion  refractoriness.  Furthermore,  anti-HLA  and  anti-
HNA immunization in the donor may result in a severe lung disorder 
called transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The Abs against 
red cell Ags may be IgM or IgG immunoglobulin classes. Some IgG or 
IgM  can  activate  complement,  and  some  IgG,  crossing  the  placental 
barrier, may induce hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.

Erythrocyte  blood  groups  refer  to  antigenic  molecules  that  are 
expressed  on  the  surface  of  RBC  and  other  cells,  genetically  trans-
mitted,  and  recognized  by  specific  Abs.  The  polymorphism  of  such 
molecules  explains  their  immunizing  potential  in  situations  such  as 
transfusion,  pregnancy,  and  transplantation.  Blood  groups  can  also 
interact with the environment and with infectious pathogens, leading 
to  individual  susceptibilities.  For  example,  malaria  is  less  severe  in 
type  O  than  non-O  patients.  Conversely,  group  O  is  associated  with 
increased susceptibility to Helicobacter pylori. Currently, ~380 different 
blood group Ags have been described, classified within ~43 different 
systems.  Blood  group  Ags  belong  to  two  broad  categories  based  on 
their  biochemical  nature:  carbohydrate  blood  groups  and  protein 
blood groups. RBC Ags may be the target of autoantibodies (autoAbs) 
generating autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of them, mostly IgG, 
are active at 37°C, called “warm autoAbs ,” and are most often directed 
against Rh Ags, while others, most often IgM, are active at 4°C, called 
“cold autoAbs,” and may be directed against ABO, I, I, P, and other Ags.
Carbohydrate blood groups are headed by the ABO system which 
comprises two main Ags, A and B, encoded by two alleles, which are 
the  A  and  B  alleles,  respectively.  In  addition  to  these  active  alleles, 
there is an inactive allele: O. Depending on the genotype, four different 
phenotypes are produced (Table 113-2). Other carbohydrate systems 
(H,  P1PK,  Lewis,  I,  and  GLOB)  share  many  characteristics  with  the 
ABO system. The main common feature is biochemical. Indeed, given 
their  carbohydrate  nature,  Ags  of  the  ABO  system  are  considered  to 
be “secondary products” of genes. The A allele encodes the A enzyme, 
which binds the A-type sugar (GalNac) A to the H substrate (expressed 
by action of the H enzyme encoded by the H allele, which happens to 
be inactive in the Bombay phenotype); sugars are attached to protein 
substrates on the surface of the RBC and so forth.

Carbohydrate  Ags  are  ubiquitously  distributed  in  the  body.  The 
ABO Ags, expressed on endothelial cells, are genuine “tissue” groups 
and may be involved in graft rejection. These Ags are not specific to 
humans but are shared by many species including viruses and bacteria. 
The  presence  of  A  and  B  Ags  in  the  environment  and,  in  particular, 
on  the  bacteria  of  the  microbiota  explains  the  synthesis  of  so-called 
“natural”  or  “regular”  Abs,  aside  from  any  transfusion  or  pregnancy. 
Such Abs have a major hemolytic capacity as they bind complement 
and  activate  its  cascade  up  to  the  membrane  attack  complex.  This 
imposes donor-recipient stringent compatibility rules for RBCCs and 

whole blood transfusion and, albeit less stringently, for plasma and PC 
transfusion.

Protein  blood  groups  are  headed  by  the  Rh  system  (formerly 
termed  “Rhesus”  or  “Rh”)  for  RBCs  (Table  113-3).  As  these  Ags  are 
specific  to  humans,  the  occurrence  of  immunization  can  only  occur 
upon  allogeneic  stimulation.  The  elicited  Abs  are  called  “immune” 
and  “irregular”  because  their  appearance  following  immunization  is 
inconstant. These Abs directed against Ags of RBC groups other than 
ABO must be detected before RBCC cell transfusion or transplantation 
and  during  pregnancy.  Of  the  43  RBC  group  systems  described,  five

(Rh, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, and MNS) are routinely investigated due to the 
clinical significance of Abs and their frequency. Testing for all five types 
ensures routine transfusion compatibility of 95%.

The Rh system comprises nearly 56 Ags, the most immunogenic of 
which is the RhD Ag (RH1). The Rh system has two RH*D and RH*CE 
genes located on chromosome 1. The  RH*D gene codes for the RhD 
protein  expressing  the  D  Ag  (RH1)  present  in  85%,  93%,  and  >99% 
of individuals of Caucasian, African, and Asian ancestry, respectively. 
The  RH*CE  gene  codes  for  RhCE  proteins  expressing  C  (RH2)  and/
or c (RH4), and E (RH3) and/or e (RH4) Ags. The presence of the D 
Ag confers Rh “positivity,” while its absence confers Rh negativity. The 
RH*D and RH*CE genes determine eight main haplotypes (DCe, DcE, 
Dce, DCE, dce, dCe, dcE, and dCE) whose frequencies differ consider-
ably among different geographical populations. The high diversity of 
the Rh Ags includes weak or partial expression. Identifying individuals 
(especially  young  females  of  childbearing  potential  and  multitrans-
fused  patients)  with  a  weak  or  partial  RhD  Ag  is  important  to  ade-
quately  select  RhD-positive  or  -negative  RBCs.  Molecular  biology  is 
now routinely applied to resolve such situations.

The Kell system comprises 36 Ags, one of which is routinely deter-
mined: the K antigen (KEL1); 9% and 2% of individuals of Caucasian 
and African ancestry are K positive (KEL:1), respectively, whereas 91% 
and 98%, respectively, are K negative (KEL:–1). The immunogenicity 
of Kell is third behind the ABO and Rh systems. The Kell protein is 
linked to another blood group protein called Kx. The rare absence of 
this protein (controlled by a gene on X) is associated with a weak KEL 
Ag, acanthocytosis, shortened RBC survival, and a progressive form of 
muscular dystrophy that includes cardiac defects. This rare condition 
is called the McLeod phenotype.

The Duffy system (FY) comprises five Ags, two of which are rou-
tinely  tested:  the  Fya  Ag  (FY1),  coded  by  the  Fya  allele,  and  the  Fyb 
Ag (FY2), coded by the Fyb allele. Depending on the combination of 
alleles, three common phenotypes are expected: Fy (a+b+), which has 
the two alleles Fya and Fyb; Fy (a+b–), which has only the Fya allele in 
a double dose; and Fy (a–b+), which has only a double dose of the Fyb 
allele. A particular phenotype characterized by the absence of the Fya 
and Fyb Ags, the Fy(a–b–) phenotype, is exclusive (with some excep-
tions) to individuals of African ancestry where it can reach frequencies 
of 70–100% depending on the population. It is linked to the presence 
of a double dose of a silent FY*0 allele. This distribution may be related 
to  the  fact  that  the  Fy  Ags  serve  as  receptors  for  Plasmodium  vivax 
and  therefore  the  Fy(a–b–)  phenotype.  However,  these  individuals 
may develop Abs against two high-frequency Ags (FY3 and FY5) after 
transfusion or pregnancy. They may also have low granulocyte counts 
that come to the attention of physicians, but the condition is not asso-
ciated with any disease.

The Kidd system (JK) comprises three Ags, two of which are rou-
tinely tested: the Jka Ag (JK1), coded by the Jka allele, and the Jkb Ag 
(JK2), coded by the Jkb allele. Depending on the combinations of alle-
les, three common phenotypes are seen: Jk(a+b+) displaying the two 
alleles  Jka  and  Jkb,  Jk(a+b–)  displaying  only  the  Jka  allele  in  a  double 
dose,  and  Jk(a–b+)  displaying  only  a  double  dose  of  the Jkb  allele.  A 
particular  phenotype  is  characterized  by  the  absence  of  the  Jka  and 
Jkb  Ags:  the  Jk(a–b–)  phenotype  found  in  Polynesian  populations.  It 
is linked to the presence of a double dose of a silent JK*0 allele. These 
people may develop Abs against the high-frequency anti-JK3 Ag after 
transfusion or pregnancy.

The  MNS  system  comprises  49  Ags,  four  of  which  are  routinely 
tested. Two genes (GYPA, GYPB) encode two pairs of so-called “anti-
thetical”  Ags.  The  M  (MNS1)  and  N  (MNS2)  pair  Ags  encoded  by 
the M and N alleles, respectively, are branched on the glycophorin A 
molecule. Their combination will determine whether or not they are 
present. M+ and N+ subjects have both alleles; an M+, N– subject is 
homozygous for the M allele; and an M–, N+ subject is homozygous for 
the N allele. The same holds true for the other pair of Ags, S (MNS3) 
and s (MNS4) expressed on glycophorin B. Therefore, an M+, N–, S–, 
s+ subject (in international nomenclature, this is written as MNS:1,–
2,–3,5) will be homozygous for the M and s alleles. A rare phenotype, 

S–s–, found exclusively in individuals of African ancestry, can develop 
an Ab against the high-frequency U Ag (MNS:5) after transfusion or 
pregnancy.
 ■ RARE RBC PHENOTYPES
Some patients present with rare genotype/phenotype assortments and 
their  RBCs  display  so-called  private  Ags  or,  conversely,  lack  public 
Ags  (i.e.,  widely  shared  Ags)  toward  which  the  patient  may  develop 
an  immune  response  when  exposed  to  these  Ags.  Public-negative 
immunized  individuals  are  virtually  impossible  to  transfuse  using 
conventional  blood  bank  resources  and  require  access  to  designated 
blood  banks  that  have  access  to  rare  blood  programs.  Their  primary 
responsibility is to identify and collect blood from donors exhibiting 
particular Ag displays on their RBCs or platelets that are uncommon 
in the given jurisdiction. Specific ethnic populations may be targeted, 
as some may display genotype specificities, such as the Bombay group 
in  southwestern  Indians.  Several  hemoglobinopathies,  such  as  sickle 
cell disease, are more common in individuals of African ancestry. Such 
patients  may  display  RBC  phenotypes  that  are  uncommon  in  coun-
tries in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in difficulties adequately 
identifying donors to match the need, as a last resort, for highly valued 
cryopreserved BCs.

BCs  are  life-saving  therapies  but  also  scarce  resources.  Furthermore, 
transfusion  may  result  in  well-identified  adverse  reactions  as  well  as 
more ill-defined adverse events, including inflammation and therapeu-
tic  inefficacy.  As  highlighted  in  so-called  patient  blood  management 
programs, transfusion should be considered within a multidisciplinary 
approach that includes optimization of hematopoiesis, minimization of 
blood loss during surgical interventions, and optimization of tolerance 
to anemia. Clinical indications of BCs as well as means to assess thera-
peutic efficacy are detailed in Table 113-4.

ADVERSE REACTIONS TO BLOOD 
COMPONENTS
Adverse  reactions  to  transfused  BCs  are  most  commonly  non- 
life-threatening,  although  serious  reactions  can  present  with  mild 
symptoms and signs. Transfused patients should be closely monitored 
for  warning  signs  suggestive  of  adverse  reactions,  as  described  in 
Table  113-5. When an adverse reaction is suspected, the transfusion 
must  be  stopped  while  the  recipient’s  clinical  status  is  assessed  and 
supportive care is initiated as needed. An average of 35 transfusion-as-
sociated fatalities with possible to definite imputability were reported 
yearly to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2014 
and 2018 among ~14 million transfused BCs. Most frequent causes of 
death were transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) (32%), 
followed by TRALI (26%), hemolysis (18%), and sepsis (14%).

Adverse  reactions  to  BCs  may  result  in  immune  and  nonimmune 
mechanisms.  Immune-mediated  reactions  are  often  due  to  recipient 
or  donor  alloimmunization  and  the  presence  of  preformed  recipient  or 
donor Abs. Nonimmune causes of reactions are from the physical or 
chemical properties of BCs or from pathogens present in the BC.
 ■ IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
Hemolytic Transfusion Adverse Reactions 
Immune-mediated  
acute hemolysis occurs when the recipient preformed Abs lyse trans-
fused  donor  RBCs  and  may  occur  during  or  24  h  after  transfusion. 
The anti-A or anti-B Abs are responsible for the majority of the most 
severe reactions, which can be fatal. However, alloAbs directed against 
other RBC Ags (i.e., Rh, Kell, and Duffy) are also responsible for severe 
hemolytic reactions. Such dramatic reactions are usually caused by a 
failure in product or patient identification, erroneous blood grouping, 
or  unidentified  anti-RBC  alloimmunization  in  the  recipient.  Hemo-
lysis, most often of lesser severity, may also occur upon tranfusion of 
BCs  containing  incompatible  plasma  with  a  large  amount  of  alloAbs 
directed  against  the  recipient’s  RBCs.  This  may  typically  occur  after

transfusion of a PC containing ABO-incompatible plasma. Estimated 
frequencies of acute and chronic hemolytic adverse reactions are 1–10 
and 5–40 per 105 transfused BCs, respectively.

Mechanisms  of  transfusion  hemolytic  reactions  are  described  in 

Figure 113-1.

Prevention of hemolytic reactions relies on pretransfusion testing 
of potential recipients. Testing will include determination of the ABO 
RhD  phenotype  (and  anti-ABO  Abs)  as  well  as  additional  typing  for 
the  other  main  Rh  Ags  (CcEe):  K  Ag  of  the  Kell  system  and,  more 
rarely, Duffy, Kidd and Ss Ags, depending on the clinical setting. These 
determinations are most often performed by serology. However, molec-
ular typing is increasingly being used to predict RBC phenotype and 
facilitate the selection of a compatible component. Special care must be 
taken to verify the patient’s identity and apply adequate tube labeling. A 
double ABO determination performed separately may be considered, 
especially in the absence of a systematic crossmatch.

Testing will also include the screening and identification of alloAbs 
directed against RBC Ags other than ABO. This screen is performed 
by mixing patient serum with type O RBCs expressing Ags from most 
blood  group  systems  and  whose  extended  phenotype  is  known.  The 
specificity  of  the  alloAb  is  identified  by  correlating  the  presence  or 
absence of Ag with the induced—or not—agglutination. Special atten-
tion should be paid to patients receiving monoclonal Ab treatment that 

may bind to erythrocytes in vivo (such as anti-CD38 IgG treatment for 
multiple myeloma) and therefore interfere with alloAb screening. Such 
interference may be offset by sample dithiothreitol pretreatment.

Crossmatching between the recipient plasma/serum and the sample 
of  selected  RBCs  may  be  performed,  especially  when  the  recipient 
is  alloimmunized  against  RBC  or  is  frequently  transfused,  as  well  as 
in  specific  clinical  settings  such  as  sickle  cell  disease,  even  if  the  Ab 
screening is negative.

The  selection  of  a  compatible  BC  should  take  into  account  pre-
transfusion testing as well as the recipient’s clinical status. In the case 
of D (Rh1)-negative patients, every attempt must be made to provide 
Rh-negative BC to prevent anti-D alloimmunization. In an emergency 
situation,  D-positive  RBCC  can  be  safely  transfused  to  a  D-negative 
patient  who  lacks  anti-D.  However,  an  estimated  20–22%  of  RBCC 
recipients  will  become  alloimmunized  and  produce  anti-D  Abs  after 
transfusion with D-positive RBCs (this frequency is higher in healthy 
individuals).  Such  alloimmunization  can  occur  after  PC  transfusion, 
although  at  a  much  lower  frequency  (~1%).  Whenever  possible, 
females  with  childbearing  potential  (to  include  prepubertal  girls) 
should  be  transfused  with  D-  and  K  (KEL1)-compatible  RBCCs  and 
D-compatible  PCs  to  prevent  alloimmunization  and  protect  a  future 
fetus/newborn  from  an  alloimmune-mediated  hemolytic  disease.

FIGURE 113-1  Mechanisms of transfusion hemolytic reactions. A. Acute responses will involve preexisting antibodies (Abs), naturally occurring anti-A/anti-B IgM or IgG 
directed against other RBC Ab and resulting from prior sensitization. Upon interaction with cognate antigen (Ag) on transfused red blood cells (RBCs), recipient allogeneic 
Ab (alloAb), mostly natural anti-A/anti-B IgM, may fix and activate complement up to C5/C9. Formation of membrane attack complex (MAC) will create pores in transfused 
RBCs with resulting intravascular hemolysis, release of toxic moieties including free hemoglobin responsible for end-organ damage including renal failure, and tissue 
factors  contributing  to  occurrence  of  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC).  B.  Alternatively,  complement  activation  may  be  incomplete,  as  typically  observed 
in a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction involving neoformed allogeneic IgG. In such cases, complement activation up to C3 results in C3b-mediated opsonization of 
RBCs, extravascular hemolysis, and clearance through immunophagocytosis. Anemia and jaundice will be the primary clinical manifestations. C. Lastly, alloAb may not fix 
complement while ensuring antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)–mediated phagocytosis of targeted RBC. (Adapted from SR Panch et al: Hemolytic transfusion 
reactions. N Engl J Med 381:150, 2019.)

prevent allosensitization.

Hemolysis, most often of lesser severity, may also occur after trans-
fer  of  alloAbs  directed  against  the  recipient’s  RBC  Ags.  Such  ABO 
“plasmatic”  incompatibility,  called  “minor  ABO  incompatibility,”  will 
occur mainly with PC transfusions, where platelets are suspended in 
~100–300 mL of plasma (depending on whether part of the plasma is 
substituted  by  additive  solution).  BCs  containing  plasma  with  high-
titer  anti-A/B  Ab  may  induce  a  hemolytic  reaction.  When  the  trans-
fusion  of  ABO-identical  (vs  ABO-compatible)  PCs  is  feasible,  PCs 
provided by donors with low-titer anti-A/B only should be preferred. 
“High-titer”  PCs  should  be  restricted  to  group  O  recipients.  While 
there  is  no  universal  definition  of  high-titer  Abs,  a  threshold  titer  of 
1/64 (as assessed by hemagglutination) may be appropriate. It should 
be noted that the use of an additive solution in PCs substantially mit-
igates this risk. Lastly, ABO plasmatic incompatibility can lead to the 
formation  of  immune  complexes  with  soluble  A  and/or  B  Ags  and 
ensuing inflammation and platelet activation.

Acute  hemolytic  reactions  may  present  with  hypotension,  tac-
hypnea, tachycardia, fever (+1–2°C), chills, chest and back pain, hemo-
globinuria, and hemoglobinemia. In the most severe cases, DIC, acute 
renal failure, shock, and death may occur.

Delayed  hemolytic  reactions,  with  icterus  and  persisting  or  wors-
ening  anemia  as  the  main  clinical  manifestations,  result  from  an 
anamnestic response. Such reactions may occur in patients previously 

sensitized to RBC Ags who have a negative alloAb screen at the time 
of transfusion due to low Ab levels. The alloAb is detectable 1–2 weeks 
after the transfusion.

Diagnosis  of  transfusion-associated  hemolysis  relies  on  persistent 
and/or worsening anemia, depleted plasma haptoglobin levels, hemo-
globinemia  and  hemoglobinuria,  as  well  as  elevated  plasma  lactate 
dehydrogenase and unconjugated bilirubin. The direct antiglobulin test 
(DAT, or direct Coombs test) that detects immunoglobulin, and possi-
bly complement (C3d), on the surface of the recipient’s RBC will most 
often be positive (Fig. 113-2). Similarly, a positive indirect antiglobulin 
test (IAT, or indirect Coombs test) that detects anti-RBC alloAb in the 
serum will also be positive. An elution of the Ab on the surface of the 
RBC may allow for the identification of the culprit alloAb.

The management of an immune-mediated acute hemolytic transfu-
sion reaction is mainly supportive. Prompt interruption of the trans-
fusion,  biological  workup,  and  a  thorough  clerical  check  to  prevent 
a  possible  second  misidentified  transfusion  are  crucial  initial  steps. 
Vigorous hydration with isotonic saline and diuretics to maintain urine 
output is recommended. Although often self-limiting, acute hemolysis 
may  also  require  forced  alkaline  diuresis,  correction  of  electrolyte 
abnormalities, and pressor support as needed. In patients with DIC and 
severe bleeding, PC, plasma, and cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen may be 
required.  When  transfusion  of  incompatible  RBCCs  is  unavoidable, 
prophylaxis  with  steroids  (100  mg  of  hydrocortisone)  just  before  the 
transfusion  and  repeated  24  h  later  and  polyvalent  immunoglobulin

(1.2–2.0 g/kg per day over 2–3 days, initiated just before the transfu-
sion)  have  been  successfully  used  to  prevent  or  minimize  acute  and 
delayed hemolysis.

Immune-mediated  hemolysis  may  also  occur  after  allogeneic 
hematopoietic  transplantation  (most  often  involving  a  peripheral 
blood stem cell graft) or, more seldomly, solid organ transplantation. 
Minor  ABO  incompatibility,  with  subsequent  red  cell  destruction 
in  the  recipient,  is  the  most  common  cause  of  clinically  significant 
hemolysis  in  such  cases.  Viable  donor  B  lymphocytes,  called  “pas-
senger  lymphocytes,”  transferred  passively  with  the  graft,  may  pro-
duce  alloAbs  (including  anti-D  or  anti-A1  in  an  A2  donor)  that 
target recipient red cells. Such hemolysis has been reported to develop  
5–14 days after transplantation. Reduced-intensity conditioning regi-
mens and cyclosporine as prophylaxis against GVHD or rejection have 
been associated with increased risk. Transfusing RBCs compatible with 
the graft donor and the use of GVHD prophylaxis able to target B cells 
(e.g., methotrexate) have significantly reduced the incidence of passen-
ger  lymphocyte  syndrome.  Allogeneic  hematopoietic  transplantation 
may also result in acute hemolysis due to incompatible donor-derived 
red cell (and precursor) destruction by the recipient alloAbs (i.e., major 
ABO  incompatibility).  Prolonged  pure  red  cell  aplasia  may  occur  in 
such a situation. Graft deserythrocytation will reduce the risk of early 
acute hemolysis.

Polyvalent  immunoglobulin  may  contain  high  titers  of  anti-A 
(mostly)  and/or  anti-B  Abs  and  induce  acute  hemolysis,  most  often 
of limited severity. Such hemolysis is particularly described in group 
A  or  A,B  children  receiving  high-dose  immunoglobulin,  notably  for 
Kawasaki’s disease, as well as in adults treated for thrombotic thrombo-
cytopenic purpura. A similar mechanism may lead to hemolysis after 
anti-D immunoglobulin treatment for immune thrombocytopenia in 
RhD-positive patients.

Nonimmune  mechanisms  of  transfusion-associated  hemoly-
sis  include  thermal  (overheated  or  cold  BCs),  osmotic  (concurrent 
hypo-osmotic  perfusion),  and  mechanical  (pressure  related  to  high-
flow transfusion filtering during cell saver processing) mechanisms.

Autoimmune  and  drug-induced  hemolytic  anemias  may  be  exac-
erbated by transfusion and can therefore mimic hemolytic transfusion 
reactions.  Transfusion  of  RBCs  with  enzymatic  defects  may  mimic 
immune-mediated hemolysis as well. Notably, severe hemolytic reactions 
in  patients  receiving  long-term  transfusions  for  hemoglobinopathies 
(mainly sickle cell disease) can precipitate bystander hemolysis, in addi-
tion to clearing transfused red cells. The mechanisms of this hyperhe-
molytic transfusion reaction may be a mediated RBC hemolysis-related 
systemic inflammatory response and resulting lysis of red cell precur-
sors by macrophages. This process may be immediate or delayed, with 
hemoglobin  levels  falling  below  the  pretransfusion  values,  often  to 
life-threatening levels. Further RBCC transfusion typically exacerbates 
ongoing  hemolysis,  with  the  exogenous  (transfused)  allogeneic  Ags 
probably triggering further nonspecific hemolysis.

Febrile  Nonhemolytic  Transfusion  Reaction  The  most  fre-
quent  reaction  associated  with  the  transfusion  of  cellular  BCs  is 
FNHTR. This reaction is characterized by chills and rigors and a ≥1°C 
rise in body temperature and is caused by proinflammatory cytokines 
in the BC or by recipient Abs directed against donor cell Ags present 
in  the  BC.  FNHTR  is  diagnosed  when  other  causes  of  fever,  notably 
infection and hemolysis, have been excluded in the transfused patient. 
Leukocyte reduction, especially prestorage, can prevent the occurrence 
of FNHTR. Moreover, the use of additive solutions decreases FNHTR 
frequency  associated  with  PC  transfusion.  Premedication  with  anti-
pyretics has generally proven ineffective at decreasing the rate of such 
reactions and may mask relevant clinical symptoms.

Allergic  Reactions  Most  allergic  transfusion  reactions  are  mild 
and include rash, pruritus, urticaria, and localized edema. More rarely, 
allergic  reactions  may  be  severe  to  life-threatening  with  an  anaphy-
lactic  reaction  that  can  involve  bronchospasm,  respiratory  distress, 
hypotension,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  shock.  Frequencies  of  mild  and 
severe  allergic  reactions  are  ~100  and  ~5  per  105  BCs,  respectively. 

Allergic  reactions  are  related  to  plasma  proteins  found  in  transfused 
components.  Mild  reactions  may  be  treated  by  temporarily  stopping 
the transfusion and administering antihistamine drugs. Patients with 
a history of allergic transfusion reaction may be premedicated with an 
antihistamine,  although  there  is  no  consensus  on  this  issue.  Cellular 
components  can  be  washed  to  remove  residual  plasma  for  extremely 
sensitized patients. Most of the allergic presentation may not depend 
on preformed Abs and may be attributable to soluble mediators trig-
gering histamine and serotonin release from platelets and leukocytes. 
An  anaphylactic  reaction  may  occur  after  the  transfusion  of  only  a 
few milliliters of the BC. Treatment includes stopping the transfusion, 
maintaining vascular access, and administering adrenaline (0.3–0.5 mg  
subcutaneously).  Additional  treatment  with  steroids,  antihistamine 
drugs, and bronchodilators may also be required.

Patients  who  are  IgA  deficient  (<1%  of  the  population)  may  be 
sensitized to this immunoglobulin isotype and may be at risk of anaph-
ylactic reactions associated with plasma transfusion. As a precaution, 
individuals with severe IgA deficiency should therefore receive, where 
available, IgA-deficient plasma and washed cellular BCs. Patients who 
have anaphylactic or repeated allergic reactions to BCs should be tested 
for IgA deficiency. It should be noted that the importance, or even the 
reality, of such a transfusion-related allergic risk is currently debated.

Graft-Versus-Host Disease  GVHD is an extremely rare adverse 
reaction caused by transfusion, although it is a frequent complication of 
allogeneic  hematopoietic  transplantation.  Transfusion-related  GVHD 
is mediated by engrafted donor T lymphocytes in a recipient unable to 
reject  such  allogenic  lymphocytes  (as  in  severely  immunosuppressed 
patients  or  patients  homozygous  for  an  HLA  haplotype  shared  with 
the  donor).  Such  donor  T  lymphocytes  interact  with  host  HLA  Ags 
and  mount  an  immune  response,  which  is  manifested  clinically  by 
the  development,  5–10  days  after  transfusion,  of  cytopenia,  fever,  a 
characteristic  skin  rash,  diarrhea,  and  liver  function  abnormalities. 
Transfusion-associated  GVHD  is  highly  resistant  to  treatment  with 
immunosuppressive  therapies  as  well  as  ablative  therapy  followed  by 
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and is fatal in >90% of cases. 
Prevention in at-risk patients relies on the irradiation of cellular BCs 
(minimum of 25 Gy) or treating BCs with pathogen reduction technol-
ogy that will deplete all living cells in the component. At-risk patients 
include patients with inherited immune deficiency, patients undergo-
ing  autologous  or  allogeneic  hematopoietic  transplantation,  patients 
treated with immunosuppressive drugs such as purine or pyrimidine 
analogues, anti-CD52 Ab or antithymocyte globulin, fetuses receiving 
intrauterine  transfusions,  and  recipients  of  BCs  provided  by  a  blood 
relative.  Because  granulocyte  concentrates  contain  a  large  number  of 
lymphocytes, they should always be irradiated.

Transfusion-Related  Acute  Lung  Injury  TRALI  is  character-
ized  by  the  occurrence  or  worsening  of  hypoxia  and  noncardiogenic 
pulmonary  edema  with  bilateral  interstitial  infiltrates  on  chest  x-ray 
during  or  within  6  h  after  transfusion,  although  delayed  cases  may 
occur  up  to  72  h  later.  Frequency  of  TRALI  is  BC  dependent  and 
ranges, on average, from 0.5 to 10 per 105 BCs. TRALI may be difficult 
to distinguish from other causes of hypoxia, such as circulatory over-
load,  and  is  among  the  most  common  causes  of  transfusion-related 
fatalities. Treatment is supportive only. TRALI usually results from the 
transfusion of donor plasma that contains high-titer anti-HLA class II 
Abs that bind recipient cognate Ag. Anti-HLA class I and anti–human 
neutrophil antigen (HNA) Abs may also be involved. TRALI mediated 
by cytokines and chemokines in the absence of an HLA-mediated inter-
action may occur also. Leukocytes, especially when primed by either a 
bacterial moiety such as lipopolysaccharide or a cytokine/chemokine, 
aggregate  in  the  pulmonary  vasculature  and  release  inflammatory 
mediators. The transfusion of plasma and PCs from male donors and 
nulliparous or parous female donors without anti-HLA Abs has signifi-
cantly reduced the risk of TRALI where implemented. Recipient factors 
associated with an increased risk of TRALI include smoking, chronic 
alcohol  use,  shock,  liver  surgery  (transplantation),  cancer  surgery, 
mechanical ventilation, and positive fluid balance.

Posttransfusion  Purpura  This  rare  reaction  (~1/105  BCs)  is 
defined  as  a  thrombocytopenia-related  bleeding  disorder  developing 
5–12  days  after  PC  (and  more  rarely  RBCC)  transfusion,  predomi-
nantly in women. Platelet-specific alloAbs are found in the recipient, 
most  frequently  anti-HPA-1a  in  HPA-1a-negative  alloimmunized 
individuals.  The  delayed  thrombocytopenia  is  due  to  a  secondary 
increased production of alloAbs. The mechanisms for the destruction 
of  the  patient’s  own  platelets  remain  unclear.  Management  is  mostly 
supportive  but  may  require  polyvalent  immunoglobulin,  steroids,  or 
plasma  exchange.  Additional  platelet  transfusions  may  worsen  the 
thrombocytopenia or be associated with poor increments. Prevention 
of recurrence includes use of washed BCs or BCs from HPA-compatible 
donors.

Alloimmunization/Platelet  Refractoriness  A  recipient  may 
become  alloimmunized  to  a  number  of  Ags  on  cellular  blood  elements 
and plasma proteins. AlloAbs to RBC Ags are detected during pretrans-
fusion testing, and their presence may delay finding Ag-negative crossmatch- 
compatible products for transfusion. Women of childbearing age who 
are sensitized to RBC Ags (i.e., D, c, E, Kell, or Duffy) are at risk of bear-
ing a fetus with hemolytic disease of the fetus or newborn. Ag matching 
is the only pretransfusion selection test to prevent RBC alloimmuniza-
tion, which is found to occur with a frequency of ~100/105 RBCC trans-
fusions.  Alloimmunization  to  Ags  on  leukocytes  and  platelets,  most 
often  anti-HLA  Abs,  can  result  in  refractoriness  to  PC  transfusions 
(as defined by a low increase in platelet count after transfusion). Once 
alloimmunization  has  developed,  HLA-compatible  (crossmatched) 
PCs should be preferred if available. If not, repeated PCs at shortened 
intervals  may  be  considered.  Use  of  leukocyte-reduced  cellular  BCs 
will reduce the incidence of immunization. Transfusion refractoriness 
may  also  result  from  an  anti-HPA  alloimmunization,  although  less 
commonly.  Recipient  factors  associated  with  platelet  refractoriness 
include  fever,  splenomegaly,  bleeding,  DIC,  and  medications  such  as 
amphotericin  B.  Notably,  cold-stored  (and  cryopreserved)  PCs  have 
been found to have preserved hemostatic function in acutely bleeding 
patients despite poor platelet increments.

Immunomodulation  Transfusion  of  allogeneic  blood  may  be 
associated  with  immunosuppression,  as  evidenced  early  on  by  the 
beneficial effect of pretransplant transfusion on kidney graft survival. 
The intensity of such an effect is debated and, if present, is most prob-
ably  attenuated  by  the  use  of  leukoreduced  BCs.  Transfusion-related 
immunomodulation is indeed thought to be mainly mediated by donor 
leukocytes, whether transfused to the recipient or undergoing apopto-
sis during storage. However, leukoreduced RBCCs or PCs still release 
immunomodulatory mediators during storage. These mediators, along 
with  the  transfused  RBCs  or  platelets,  may  exert  various,  possibly 
opposing, immune effects in vivo, including immunosuppression and 
inflammation.

 ■ NONIMMUNOLOGIC TRANSFUSION ADVERSE 
REACTIONS
Fluid Overload  TACO is a common and underrecognized transfu-
sion adverse reaction. Estimated frequencies vary from ~10 to 1000 per 
105 BCs. TACO is now the main cause of death from transfusion since 
the TRALI risk has been mitigated. Risk factors include older age, renal 
failure, preexisting fluid overload, cardiac dysfunction, administration 
of a large volume of BCs, and an excessive rate of transfusion in rela-
tion to the patient’s hemodynamic tolerance. TACO results in dyspnea, 
hypoxia, bilateral and predominantly alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray, 
frequent systolic hypertension, and elevated brain natriuretic peptide. 
Fever may also exist. Prevention involves identifying at-risk patients, 
close  monitoring,  a  slow  transfusion  rate  (1  RBCC  over  3–4  h),  and 
use of diuretics in hemodynamically stable patients with a history of 
TACO. Treatment requires stopping the transfusion and administrat-
ing oxygen and diuretics.

Massive  Transfusion-Associated  Reactions/Electrolyte  and 
Cold Toxicity Reactions  Reactions related to massive transfusion, 

i.e., transfusion of 50% of the patient’s total blood volume over 3 h or 
>5–10  units  of  RBCCs  (plus  associated  BCs),  include  citrate  toxicity, 
hypothermia,  hyperkalemia,  and  dilutional  coagulopathy.  Citrate, 
which  is  commonly  used  to  anticoagulate  BCs,  chelates  calcium. 
Hypocalcemia,  manifested  by  circumoral  paresthesia,  and  changes 
in  cardiac  function  may  result  from  multiple  rapid  transfusions. 
Although citrate is quickly metabolized to bicarbonate, calcium infu-
sion  (through  a  separate  line)  may  be  required.  Rapid  transfusion  of 
BCs still at 4°C can result in hypothermia and cardiac dysrhythmias. 
Use of an inline warmer will prevent this complication. RBC leakage 
during storage, longer storage, and irradiation increase the concentra-
tion of potassium in the unit. Neonates and patients with renal failure 
or  other  comorbidities  (e.g.,  hyperglycemia  or  hypocalcemia)  are  at 
risk  of  hyperkalemia  and  resulting  acute  cardiac  toxicity.  Treatment 
includes  insulin,  glucose,  calcium  gluconate,  and  furosemide,  and 
prevention  includes  the  use  of  washed  or  plasma-reduced  RBCCs  or 
a storage age of <7–10 days and the avoidance of RBCCs stored for >24 h 
after irradiation.

Iron  Overload  Each  unit  of  RBCs  contains  200–250  mg  of  iron. 
In  frequently  transfused  recipients,  iron  accumulation  that  is  left 
untreated  will  affect  endocrine,  hepatic,  and  cardiac  function.  Death 
may  occur  from  cardiac  failure  or  arrhythmia.  Iron  overload  can  be 
assessed  by  means  of  serum  ferritin  measurements,  magnetic  res-
onance  imaging,  and  liver  biopsy.  Prevention  and  treatment  of  this 
frequently  underreported  transfusion  adverse  event  rely  on  careful 
monitoring and iron chelation.

Hypotensive Reactions  Acute hypotensive transfusion reactions 
are defined as an abrupt drop in blood pressure of >30 mmHg early 
after the start of transfusion and resolving quickly once the transfusion 
is stopped, without further intervention. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
or mild allergic reactions may also be present. Estimated frequency is 
1–10/105 BCs. These reactions may result from the generation of vaso-
active kinins in the BCs and are more likely to occur in hypertensive 
patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors who 
are therefore less able to metabolize bradykinin. Upon resolution, the 
same blood product should not be restarted. Switching from an ACE 
inhibitor  to  an  alternative  drug  should  be  considered  for  patients 
requiring further transfusions.

Adverse  Transfusion  Reactions  of  Uncertain  Imputability  
Necrotizing enterocolitis, which is common in preterm and very-low-
birth-weight neonates, has been infrequently described with close tem-
poral association with RBC transfusion. However, the causality of any 
association  remains  to  be  further  ascertained,  as  does  the  efficacy  of 
withholding feeds during transfusion to prevent such a complication. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a rare syndrome char-
acterized by acute reversible neurologic symptoms related to subcorti-
cal vasogenic brain edema. It has been described within 10 days after 
RBCC transfusion, mainly in women with severe (and long-standing) 
anemia.  The  prognosis  is  most  often  favorable,  although  irreversible 
neurologic  disturbance  has  been  described.  Prevention  may  include 
avoiding  rapid  correction  of  chronic  severe  anemia.  Again,  causality 
remains to be established.

 ■ INFECTIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS
Donor  screening  involves  the  selection  of  healthy  donors  without 
high-risk  lifestyles,  medical  conditions,  or  exposure  to  transmissible 
pathogens. Tests are performed on donated blood to detect the pres-
ence  of  infectious  agents  by  testing  for  relevant  Abs  or  by  directly 
detecting  infectious  agents  most  often  by  nucleic  acid  amplification 
testing. The increasing sensitivity of testing methods has progressively 
narrowed the “window” period early on after infection during which 
a low-titer undetectable virus may be present in the blood and result in a 
transfusion-transmitted infection.

Transfusion-transmitted  bacterial  infection  remains  a  significant 
concern, notably with PCs stored at room temperature, which allows 
for bacterial proliferation and results in an increased risk during stor-
age. However, some gram-negative bacteria such as Yersinia can grow

United Kingdom, in the context of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic, before implementation of systematic deleukocytation).

at 4°C and therefore may be implicated in infections related to RBCC 
transfusion. Recipients of contaminated BCs may develop abrupt (dur-
ing transfusion and up to several hours after) fever and chills, which 
can  deteriorate  to  septic  shock,  DIC,  and  death.  Endotoxin  formed 
within the BC may be implicated. After sampling for bacterial culture, 
broad-spectrum antibiotics should be promptly initiated.

Pathogen  reduction  of  platelets  and  plasma,  and  perhaps  soon 
of  RBCs  as  well,  offers  an  additional  means  of  reducing  transfusion 
infection risks. Although effective for a wide range of pathogens, such 
processes  are  most  often  ineffective  for  bacterial  spores  and  nonen-
veloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), parvovirus B19, and 
hepatitis  E  virus  (HEV).  Postdonation  information  provided  by  the 
donor (i.e., fever occurring within 24 h after donation) may allow the 
involved blood products to be quarantined and provide an additional 
safety measure.

Transfusion-transmitted  infections  are  increasingly  rare.  However, 
new or previously unidentified infectious risks may occur, as highlighted 
by the emergence of the transfusion-associated West Nile virus infection 
and babesiosis in early 2000 in the United States, as well as transfusion- 
associated hepatitis E in early 2010 in Europe. Such occurrences require 
active  surveillance  programs  and  the  appropriate  implementation  of 
mitigation  measures  such  as  additional  testing,  pathogen  reduction, 
and  travel-related  deferral  criteria.  Along  with  West  Nile  virus,  a 
number of other arbovirus-related infections possibly transmissible by 
blood transfusion are endemic or involved in large epidemic outbreaks. 
Despite being possibly present in the blood at asymptomatic phases of 
the  disease,  documented  cases  of  transfusion-transmitted  infections 
involving these arboviruses have been very rare (Zika), without a dis-
cernible clinical impact (Dengue), or absent (Chikungunya). Route of 
infection (i.e., intravenous vs mosquito bite), pathogen dose, ability to 

survive in the BC, storage temperature and duration, recipient immune 
status, and ongoing treatments may all impact the ability of a pathogen 
in the donor to induce a disease in the recipient. Estimated frequencies of 
transfusion-relevant  infections  in  donors  and  of  transfusion-transmitted 
infections are reported in Table 113-6. Such frequencies depend heavily 
on variables such as local epidemiology, donor deferral rules, risk reduc-
tion measures, and data reporting, and may vary considerably.

ALTERNATIVES AND PERSPECTIVES
In addition to promoting appropriate transfusion indications, patient 
blood management programs have highlighted a number of transfusion- 
sparing  strategies,  such  as  the  treatment  of  anemia  and/or  iron  defi-
ciency before surgery, minimization of blood loss, and optimization of 
patient red cell mass. Erythropoietin stimulates erythrocyte production 
in  patients  with  anemia  from  chronic  renal  failure  and  other  condi-
tions,  thus  avoiding  or  reducing  the  need  for  transfusion.  Thrombo-
poietin receptor agonists has been shown to reduce platelet transfusion 
needs  resulting  from  chemotherapy-induced  thrombopenia.  Gene 
therapy  approaches  in  patients  with  sickle  cell  or  major  thalassemia 
offer  the  potential  of  dramatically  reducing  their  transfusion  needs. 
Stem  cell–derived  blood  cells  such  as  RBCs  or  platelets  may  in  the 
future become a suitable alternative to rare blood donors.

Importantly,  issues  surrounding  transfusion  safety  have  evolved 
significantly and now fully encompass transfusion efficacy. New means 
of assessing transfusion efficacy are needed. Large-scale biological and 
population-based databases pertaining to blood donors and transfused 
patients  will  also  be  instrumental  in  assessing  and  understanding 
the  basis  of  transfusion  efficacy.  Optimal  transfusion  care  may  soon 
require consideration of new criteria in relation to donor, blood prod-
uct, and/or recipient characteristics.

114 Hematopoietic Cell 
Transplantation
Frederick R. Appelbaum

Bone  marrow  transplantation  was  the  original  term  used  to  describe 
the collection and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, but with 
the demonstration that peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood are 
also useful sources of stem cells, hematopoietic cell transplantation  has 
become  the  preferred  generic  term  for  this  process.  Hematopoietic 
cell  transplantation  is  used  to  treat  patients  with  an  abnormal  but 
nonmalignant  lymphohematopoietic  system  by  replacing  it  with  one 
from a normal donor. Hematopoietic cell transplantation is also used 
to treat malignancy by allowing the administration of higher doses of 
myelosuppressive therapy than would otherwise be possible and, in the 
setting of allogeneic Hematopoietic cell transplantation, by conferring 
an  immunologic  graft-versus-tumor  effect.  The  use  of  hematopoietic 
cell transplantation is increasing, as it becomes safer and applicable to 
more diseases and as donor availability expands.

The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research 
(http://www.cibmtr.org) estimates that worldwide about 100,000 trans-
plants  were  performed  in  2020.  The  frequency  of  transplantation 
varied  widely  from  country  to  country,  with  a  close  association  of 
transplant rates with gross national income (GNI) per capita. However, 
even among countries with similar GNIs per capita, there are substan-
tial differences between countries and regions regarding the frequency 
of transplantation, disease indications, and choice of donor type.

THE HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL
Several  features  of  the  hematopoietic  stem  cell  make  transplantation 
clinically  feasible,  including  its  remarkable  regenerative  capacity,  its 
ability to home to the marrow space following intravenous injection, 
and the ability of the stem cell to be cryopreserved (Chap. 96). Trans-
plantation of a single stem cell can replace the entire lymphohemato-
poietic  system  of  an  adult  mouse.  In  humans,  transplantation  of  a 
small percentage of a donor’s bone marrow volume regularly results in 
complete and sustained replacement of the recipient’s entire lympho-
hematopoietic  system,  including  all  red  cells,  granulocytes,  B  and  T 
lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as cells comprising the fixed macro-
phage population, including Kupffer cells of the liver, pulmonary alve-
olar  macrophages,  osteoclasts,  and  Langerhans  cells  of  the  skin.  The 
ability of the hematopoietic stem cell to home to the marrow following 
intravenous injection is mediated, in part, by an interaction between 
CXCL12,  also  known  as  stromal  cell–derived  factor  1,  produced  by 
marrow stromal cells and the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 found 
on  stem  cells.  Homing  is  also  influenced  by  the  interaction  of  cell- 
surface  molecules,  termed  selectins,  including  E-  and  L-selectin,  on 
bone marrow endothelial cells with ligands, termed integrins, such as 
VLA-4, on early hematopoietic cells. Human hematopoietic stem cells 

can  survive  freezing  and  thawing  with  little,  if  any,  damage,  making 
it  possible  to  remove  and  store  a  portion  of  the  patient’s  own  bone 
marrow  for  later  reinfusion  following  treatment  of  the  patient  with 
high-dose myelotoxic therapy.

Hematopoietic  cell  transplantation  can  be  described  according  to  the 
relationship  between  the  patient  and  the  donor  and  by  the  anatomic 
source of stem cells. In ~1% of cases, patients have identical twins who 
can serve as donors. With the use of syngeneic donors, there is no risk of 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and unlike the use of autologous mar-
row, there is no risk that the stem cells are contaminated with tumor cells.
Allogeneic  transplantation  involves  a  donor  and  a  recipient  who 
are  not  genetically  identical.  Following  allogeneic  transplantation, 
immune  cells  transplanted  with  the  stem  cells  or  developing  from 
them  can  react  against  the  patient,  causing  GVHD.  Alternatively,  if 
the immunosuppressive preparative regimen used to treat the patient 
before transplant is inadequate, immunocompetent cells of the patient 
can cause graft rejection. The risks of these complications are greatly 
influenced by the degree of matching between donor and recipient for 
human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  molecules  encoded  by  genes  of  the 
major histocompatibility complex.

HLA molecules are responsible for binding antigenic proteins and pre-
senting them to T cells. The antigens presented by HLA molecules may 
derive from exogenous sources (e.g., during active infections) or may be 
endogenous proteins. If individuals are not HLA-matched, T cells from 
one  individual  will  react  strongly  to  the  mismatched  HLA,  or  “major 
antigens,” of the second. Even if the individuals are HLA-matched, the T 
cells of the donor may react to differing endogenous or “minor antigens” 
presented by the HLA of the recipient. Reactions to minor antigens tend 
to  be  less  vigorous.  The  genes  of  major  relevance  to  transplantation 
include HLA-A, -B, -C, and -D; they are closely linked and therefore tend 
to be inherited as haplotypes, with only rare crossovers between them. 
Thus, the odds that any one full sibling will match a patient are one in 
four, and the probability that the patient has an HLA-identical sibling is 
1 − (0.75)n, where n equals the number of siblings.

With  conventional  techniques,  the  risk  of  graft  rejection  is  1–3%, 
and the risk of severe, life-threatening acute GVHD is ~15% following 
transplantation between HLA-identical siblings. The incidence of graft 
rejection  and  GVHD  increases  progressively  with  the  use  of  family 
member donors mismatched for one, two, or three antigens. Although 
survival following a one-antigen mismatched transplant is not mark-
edly  altered,  survival  following  two-  or  three-antigen  mismatched 
transplants  is  reduced.  Newer  approaches  to  GVHD  prophylaxis, 
including  the  use  of  posttransplant  high-dose  cyclophosphamide, 
make  transplantation  between  donor/recipient  pairs  who  share  only 
one  HLA  haplotype  possible.  Since  the  formation  of  the  National 
Marrow Donor Program and other registries, HLA-matched unrelated 
donors can be identified for many patients. The genes encoding HLA 
antigens are highly polymorphic, and thus the odds of any two unre-
lated  individuals  being  HLA  identical  are  extremely  low,  somewhat 
less  than  1  in  10,000.  However,  by  recruiting  >30  million  volunteer 
donors, HLA-matched donors can be found for ~60% of patients for 
whom a search is initiated, with higher rates among whites and lower 
rates among minorities and patients of mixed race. It takes, on average,  
3–4 months to complete a search and schedule and initiate an unrelated 
donor transplant. With improvements in HLA typing and supportive 
care measures, survival following matched unrelated donor transplan-
tation is essentially the same as that seen with HLA-matched siblings.
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  cell  transplantation  can  be  carried  out 
across ABO blood barriers by removing isoagglutinins and/or incom-
patible red blood cells from the donor graft. However, depending on 
the direction of the mismatch, hemolysis of donor cells by persistent 
isoagglutinins in the host, or hemolysis of recipient red cells by isoag-
glutinins in the graft or developing from it may occur despite appropri-
ate manipulation of the donor cell product.

Autologous transplantation involves the removal and storage of the 
patient’s  own  stem  cells  with  subsequent  reinfusion  after  the  patient

receives high-dose myeloablative therapy. Unlike allogeneic transplan-
tation,  there  is  no  risk  of  GVHD  or  graft  rejection  with  autologous 
transplantation. On the other hand, autologous transplantation lacks a 
graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect, and the autologous stem cell product 
can be contaminated with tumor cells, which could lead to relapse. A 
variety of techniques have been developed to “purge” autologous prod-
ucts of tumor cells, but no prospective randomized trials have shown 
that any approach decreases relapse rates or improves disease-free or 
overall survival.

Bone marrow aspirated from the posterior and anterior iliac crests 
initially was the source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation. 
Typically, anywhere from 1.5 to 5 × 108 nucleated marrow cells per kilo-
gram are collected for allogeneic transplantation. Several studies have 
found improved survival following both matched sibling and unrelated 
transplantation by transplanting higher numbers of bone marrow cells.
Hematopoietic  stem  cells  circulate  in  the  peripheral  blood  but  in 
very  low  concentrations.  Following  the  administration  of  a  myeloid 
growth factor such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 
and during recovery from intensive chemotherapy, the concentration 
of  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells  in  blood,  as  measured  either  by 
colony-forming  units  or  expression  of  the  CD34  antigen,  increases 
markedly. This makes it possible to harvest adequate numbers of stem 
cells  from  the  peripheral  blood  for  transplantation.  Donors  are  typi-
cally treated with 4 or 5 days of hematopoietic growth factor, following 
which stem cells are collected in one or two 4-h pheresis sessions. In 
the  autologous  setting,  transplantation  of  >2.5  ×  106  CD34  cells  per 
kilogram, a number that can be collected in most circumstances, leads 
to rapid and sustained engraftment in virtually all cases. In the 5–10% 
of patients who fail to mobilize enough CD34+ cells with growth fac-
tor alone, the addition of plerixafor, an antagonist of CXCR4, may be 
useful. Blocking CXCR4 allows more stem cells to escape the marrow. 
When  compared  to  the  use  of  autologous  marrow,  use  of  periph-
eral  blood  stem  cells  results  in  more  rapid  hematopoietic  recovery. 
Although  this  more  rapid  recovery  diminishes  the  morbidity  rate  of 
transplantation, no studies show improved survival.

In the setting of allogeneic transplantation, the use of growth factor– 
mobilized peripheral blood stem cells also results in faster engraftment 
than seen with marrow but at the cost of more chronic GVHD because 
of  donor  T-cell  contamination.  With  matched  sibling  donors,  the 
increased chronic GVHD is more than balanced by reductions in relapse 
rates  and  nonrelapse  mortality  rates,  resulting  in  improved  overall 
survival. However, in the setting of matched unrelated donor transplan-
tation, use of peripheral blood results in more chronic GVHD without 
a compensatory survival advantage, favoring the use of bone marrow.

Umbilical cord blood contains a high concentration of hematopoi-
etic progenitor cells, allowing for its use as a source of stem cells for 
transplantation.  Cord  blood  transplantation  from  family  members 
has been used when the immediate need for transplantation precludes 
waiting the 9 or so months generally required for the baby to mature 
to the point of donating marrow. Use of cord blood results in slower 
peripheral count recovery than seen with marrow but a lower incidence 
of GVHD, perhaps reflecting the low number of T cells in cord blood. 
Multiple cord blood banks have been developed to harvest and store 
cord  blood  for  possible  transplantation  to  unrelated  patients  from 
material that would otherwise be discarded. Currently >800,000 units 
are  cryopreserved  and  available  for  use.  The  advantages  of  unrelated 
cord  blood  are  rapid  availability  and  decreased  immune  reactivity 
allowing for the use of partially matched units, which is of particular 
importance for those without matched unrelated donors. The risks of 
graft failure and transplant-related mortality are related to the dose of 
cord blood cells per kilogram, which previously limited the application 
of  single  cord  blood  transplantation  to  pediatric  and  smaller  adult 
patients. Subsequent trials have found that for patients without suitable 
single cord units, the use of double cord transplants diminishes the risk 
of graft failure and early mortality even though only one of the donors 
ultimately  engrafts.  Given  the  similar  survival  rates  seen  with  cord 
blood, matched unrelated, and haploidentical family member donors, 
a  source  of  allogeneic  stem  cells  can  now  be  found  for  almost  every 
patient in need (Table 114-1).

THE TRANSPLANT PREPARATIVE REGIMEN
The treatment regimen administered to patients immediately preced-
ing  transplantation  is  designed  to  eradicate  the  patient’s  underlying 
disease and, in the setting of allogeneic transplantation, immunosup-
press  the  patient  adequately  to  prevent  rejection  of  the  transplanted 
stem cells. The appropriate regimen therefore depends on the disease 
setting  and  graft  source.  For  example,  when  transplantation  is  per-
formed to treat severe combined immunodeficiency and the donor is 
a histocompatible sibling, no treatment is needed because no host cells 
require eradication and the patient is already too immune-incompetent 
to reject the transplanted graft. For aplastic anemia, there is no large 
population of cells to eradicate, and high-dose cyclophosphamide plus 
antithymocyte  globulin  are  sufficient  to  immunosuppress  the  patient 
adequately  to  accept  the  marrow  graft.  In  the  setting  of  thalassemia 
and sickle cell anemia, high-dose busulfan is frequently added to cyclo-
phosphamide  to  eradicate  hyperplastic  host  hematopoiesis.  A  variety 
of different regimens have been developed to treat malignant diseases. 
Most regimens include agents with high activity against the tumor in 
question at conventional doses and with myelosuppression as their pre-
dominant dose-limiting toxicity. Therefore, these regimens commonly 
include busulfan, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, thiotepa, carmustine, 
etoposide, and total-body irradiation in various combinations.

Although  high-dose  treatment  regimens  were  the  initial  approach 
to  transplantation  for  malignancies,  the  realization  that  much  of  the 
antitumor  effect  of  transplantation  derives  from  an  immunologically 
mediated  GVT  response  led  investigators  to  ask  if  reduced-intensity 
conditioning regimens might be effective and more tolerable. Evidence 
for  a  GVT  effect  comes  from  studies  showing  that  posttransplant 
relapse  rates  are  lowest  in  patients  who  develop  acute  and  chronic 
GVHD, higher in those without GVHD, and higher still in recipients 
of T cell–depleted allogeneic or syngeneic marrow. The demonstration 
that complete remissions can be obtained in many patients who have 
relapsed after transplant by simply administering viable lymphocytes 
from the original donor further strengthens the argument for a potent 
GVT  effect.  Accordingly,  a  variety  of  alternative  regimens  have  been 
studied, ranging from nonmyeloablative, which are the very minimum 
required to achieve engraftment (e.g., fludarabine plus 200 cGy total-
body  irradiation)  and  would  cause  only  transient  myelosuppression 
if  no  transplant  were  performed,  to  so-called  reduced-intensity  regi-
mens, which would cause significant but not necessarily fatal myelo-
suppression  in  the  absence  of  transplantation  (e.g.,  fludarabine  plus 
melphalan). Studies to date document that engraftment can be readily 
achieved  with  less  toxicity  than  seen  with  conventional  transplanta-
tion.  Complete  sustained  responses  have  been  documented  in  many 
patients, particularly those with more indolent hematologic malignan-
cies.  In  general,  relapse  rates  are  higher  following  reduced-intensity 
conditioning, but transplant-related mortality is lower, favoring the use 
of reduced-intensity conditioning in patients with significant comor-
bidities. High-dose regimens are favored in those felt able to tolerate 
the treatment, particularly if patients have any evidence of measurable 
disease at the time of transplantation.
 ■ THE TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE
Marrow is usually collected from the donor’s posterior and sometimes 
anterior iliac crests, with the donor under general or spinal anesthesia. 
Typically, 10–15 mL/kg of marrow is aspirated, placed in heparinized 
media, and filtered through 0.3- and 0.2-mm screens to remove fat and 
bony spicules. The collected marrow may undergo further processing

depending  on  the  clinical  situation,  such  as  the  removal  of  red  cells 
to  prevent  hemolysis  in  ABO-incompatible  transplants,  the  removal 
of  donor  T  cells  to  prevent  GVHD,  or  attempts  to  remove  possible 
contaminating  tumor  cells  in  autologous  transplantation.  Marrow 
donation is safe, with only very rare complications reported.

Peripheral blood stem cells are collected by leukapheresis after the 
donor  has  been  treated  with  hematopoietic  growth  factors  or,  in  the 
setting of autologous transplantation, sometimes after treatment with 
a  combination  of  chemotherapy  and  growth  factors.  Stem  cells  for 
transplantation are infused through a large-bore central venous cath-
eter.  Such  infusions  are  usually  well  tolerated,  although  occasionally 
patients develop fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These symptoms 
typically  resolve  with  slowing  of  the  infusion.  When  the  stem  cell 
product  has  been  cryopreserved  using  dimethyl  sulfoxide,  patients 
sometimes experience short-lived nausea or vomiting due to the taste 
(and smell) of the cryoprotectant.
 ■ ENGRAFTMENT AND IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION
Peripheral blood counts reach their nadir several days to a week after 
transplant as a consequence of the preparative regimen; then cells pro-
duced by the transplanted stem cells begin to appear in the peripheral 
blood.  The  rate  of  recovery  depends  on  the  source  of  stem  cells  and 
use of posttransplant growth factors. If marrow is the source, recovery 
to 100 granulocytes/μL occurs on average by day 16 and to 500/μL by 
day 22. Use of G-CSF–mobilized peripheral blood stem cells speeds the 
rate of recovery by ~1 week compared to marrow, whereas engraftment 
following cord blood transplantation is typically delayed by ~1 week. 
Use  of  a  myeloid  growth  factor  after  transplant  accelerates  recovery 
by 3–5 days. Platelet counts usually recover shortly after granulocytes.
While  granulocytes  and  other  components  of  innate  immunity 
recover rapidly after hematopoietic cell transplantation, adaptive immu-
nity, which consists of cellular (T cell) and humoral (B cell) immunity, 
may take 1–2 years to fully recover. Survival and peripheral expansion 
of infused donor T cells is the dominant mechanism for T cell recovery 
in the first months after hematopoietic cell transplantation and results 
in mostly CD8+ T cells with a limited repertoire. After several months, 
de novo generation of donor derived CD4+ and CD8+ T cells becomes 
dominant  providing  a  more  diverse  T-cell  repertoire.  B-cell  counts 
recover by 6 months after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation 
and 9 months after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In gen-
eral, immune recovery occurs more rapidly after autologous than alloge-
neic hematopoietic cell transplantation and after receipt of unmodified 
grafts compared to the setting of in vivo or ex vivo T-cell depletion.

Following  allogeneic  transplantation,  engraftment  can  be  docu-
mented using fluorescence in situ hybridization of sex chromosomes if 
donor and recipient are sex-mismatched or by analysis of short tandem 
repeat polymorphisms after DNA amplification.
 ■ COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING HEMATOPOIETIC 
CELL TRANSPLANTATION
Early  Direct  Chemoradiotoxicities  The  transplant  preparative 
regimen  may  cause  a  spectrum  of  acute  toxicities  that  vary  according 
to intensity of the regimen and the specific agents used but frequently 
include nausea, vomiting, and mild skin erythema (Fig. 114-1). High-
dose  cyclophosphamide  can  result  in  hemorrhagic  cystitis,  which  can 
usually be prevented by bladder irrigation or with the sulfhydryl com-
pound mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA). Most high-dose preparative 
regimens will result in oral mucositis, which typically develops 5–7 days 
after transplant and often requires narcotic analgesia. Use of a patient-
controlled analgesic pump provides the greatest patient satisfaction and 
results  in  a  lower  cumulative  dose  of  narcotic.  Keratinocyte  growth 
factor (palifermin) can shorten the duration of mucositis by several days 
following autologous transplantation. Patients begin losing their hair 5–6 
days after transplant and by 1 week are usually profoundly pancytopenic.
Depending on the intensity of the conditioning regimen, 3–10% of 
patients  will  develop  sinusoidal  obstruction  syndrome  (SOS)  of  the 
liver (formerly called venoocclusive disease), a syndrome that results 
from  direct  cytotoxic  injury  to  hepatic-venular  and  sinusoidal  endo-
thelium, with subsequent deposition of fibrin and the development of

a local hypercoagulable state. This chain of events leads to the clinical 
symptoms  of  tender  hepatomegaly,  ascites,  jaundice,  and  fluid  reten-
tion.  These  symptoms  can  develop  any  time  during  the  first  month 
after transplant, with the peak incidence at day 16. Predisposing fac-
tors  include  prior  exposure  to  intensive  chemotherapy,  pretransplant 
hepatitis of any cause, and use of more intense conditioning regimens. 
The mortality rate of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is ~30%, with 
progressive hepatic failure culminating in a terminal hepatorenal syn-
drome. Treatment of severe SOS with defibrotide, a polydeoxyribonu-
cleotide, reduces mortality.

Although  most  pneumonias  developing  early  after  transplant  are 
caused by infectious agents, in a small percentage of patients, a diffuse 
interstitial pneumonia will develop that is a result of direct toxicity of 
high-dose preparative regimens. Bronchoalveolar lavage usually shows 
alveolar hemorrhage, and biopsies are typically characterized by diffuse 
alveolar damage, although some cases may have a more clearly inter-
stitial pattern. High-dose glucocorticoids or antitumor necrosis factor 
therapies are sometimes used as treatment, although randomized trials 
proving their utility have not been reported.

Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy is seen in 5–10% 
of patients, appearing on average about 1 month after transplant. The 
syndrome  is  characterized  by  presence  of  schistocytes  on  peripheral 
smear,  elevated  lactate  dehydrogenase,  thrombocytopenia,  and  acute 
kidney injury and is the result of endothelial injury and complement 
activation. Since calcineurin inhibitors are thought to contribute to the 
pathogenesis of the syndrome, changing immunosuppressive regimens 
is sometimes effective. Patients sometimes respond to eculizumab.

Late  Direct  Chemoradiotoxicities  Two  categories  of  chronic 
pulmonary  disease  occur  in  patients  >3  months  after  hematopoietic 
cell transplantation. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is a restrictive 
lung disease characterized by dry cough, shortness of breath, and chest 
imaging  showing  a  diffuse,  fluffy  infiltrate.  Biopsy  shows  granulation 
tissue within alveolar spaces and small airways and no infectious agents. 
The disease responds well to corticosteroids and is entirely reversible. 
Bronchiolitis obliterans is an obstructive disease presenting with cough, 
progressive  dyspnea,  and  radiologic  evidence  of  air  trapping.  Pathol-
ogy  shows  collagen  and  granulation  tissue  in  and  around  bronchial 
structures and eventually obliteration of small airways. The disease is 
usually associated with chronic GVHD, and although it may respond 
to increasing immunosuppression, complete reversal is uncommon.

Other  late  complications  of  the  preparative  regimen  include 
decreased  growth  velocity  in  children  and  delayed  development  of 
secondary  sex  characteristics.  These  complications  can  be  partly 
ameliorated  with  the  use  of  appropriate  growth  and  sex  hormone

replacement. Most men become azoospermic, and most postpubertal 
women will develop ovarian failure, which should be treated. However, 
pregnancy  is  possible  after  transplantation,  and  patients  should  be 
counseled accordingly. Thyroid dysfunction, usually well compensated, 
is  sometimes  seen.  Cataracts  develop  in  10–20%  of  patients  and  are 
most common in patients treated with total-body irradiation and those 
who  receive  glucocorticoid  therapy  after  transplant  for  treatment  of 
GVHD. Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head is seen in 10% of patients 
and is particularly frequent following chronic glucocorticoid therapy. 
Both acute and late chemoradiotoxicities (except those due to glucocor-
ticoids and other agents used to treat GVHD) are less frequent in recip-
ients of reduced-intensity compared to high-dose preparative regimens.

Graft  Failure  Although  complete  and  sustained  engraftment  is 
usually seen after transplant, occasionally marrow function either does 
not return or, after a brief period of engraftment, is lost. Graft failure 
after autologous transplantation can be the result of inadequate num-
bers of stem cells being transplanted, damage during ex vivo treatment 
or storage, or exposure of the patient to myelotoxic agents after trans-
plant. Infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or human herpesvirus 
type 6 have also been associated with loss of marrow function. Graft 
failure after allogeneic transplantation can also be due to immunologic 
rejection of the graft by immunocompetent host cells. Such rejection 
is  generally  thought  to  be  mostly  T-cell  mediated,  but  the  presence 
pre-hematopoietic cell transplantation of donor-specific HLA antibod-
ies  in  the  patient  is  associated  with  poor  engraftment,  leading  to  the 
recommendation for screening for donor-directed anti-HLA antibodies 
in recipients prior to transplant. Immunologically based graft rejection 
is more common following use of less immunosuppressive preparative 
regimens,  in  recipients  of  T  cell–depleted  stem  cell  products,  and  in 
patients receiving grafts from HLA-mismatched donors or cord blood.
Treatment  of  graft  failure  involves  removing  all  potentially  mye-
lotoxic agents from the patient’s regimen and attempting a short trial 
of a myeloid growth factor. Persistence of lymphocytes of host origin 
in  allogeneic  transplant  recipients  with  graft  failure  indicates  immu-
nologic  rejection.  Reinfusion  of  donor  stem  cells  in  such  patients  is 
usually unsuccessful unless preceded by a second immunosuppressive 
preparative  regimen.  Standard  high-dose  preparative  regimens  are 
tolerated  poorly  if  administered  within  100  days  of  a  first  transplant 
because  of  cumulative  toxicities.  However,  reduced-intensity  condi-
tioning regimens have been effective in some cases.
Graft-Versus-Host  Disease  Acute  GVHD  occurs  within  the 
first  3  months  after  allogeneic  transplant  with  a  peak  onset  around  
4 weeks and is characterized by an erythematous maculopapular rash; 
by persistent anorexia or diarrhea, or both; and by liver disease with 
increased serum levels of bilirubin, alanine and aspartate aminotrans-
ferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Because many conditions can mimic 
acute GVHD, the diagnosis usually requires skin, liver, or endoscopic 
biopsy  for  confirmation.  In  all  these  organs,  endothelial  damage  and 
lymphocytic infiltrates are seen. In skin, the epidermis and hair follicles 
are damaged; in liver, the small bile ducts show segmental disruption; 
and in intestines, destruction of the crypts and mucosal ulceration may 
be noted. A commonly used rating system for acute GVHD is shown in 
Table 114-2. Grade I acute GVHD is of little clinical significance, does 

not affect the likelihood of survival, and does not require treatment. In 
contrast, grades II to IV GVHD are associated with significant symp-
toms and a poorer probability of survival and require aggressive ther-
apy. The incidence of acute GVHD is higher in recipients of stem cells 
from mismatched or unrelated donors, in older patients, and in patients 
unable to receive full doses of drugs used to prevent the disease.

Currently,  the  standard  approach  to  GVHD  prevention  is  the 
administration of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) 
combined  with  an  antimetabolite  (methotrexate  or  mycophenolate 
mofetil) following transplantation. The addition of anti–T-cell immune 
globulin  (ATG)  may  further  reduce  the  incidence  of  GVHD  but  has 
not  been  shown  to  improve  survival.  Other  approaches  being  tested 
in  phase  3  studies  include  the  addition  of  sirolimus  to  the  standard 
two-drug regimen, the removal of subsets or all T cells from the stem 
cell inoculum, and the use of cyclophosphamide administered several 
days after transplant in an effort to deplete activated alloreactive T cells.
Despite prophylaxis, significant acute GVHD will develop in ~30% 
of  recipients  of  stem  cells  from  matched  siblings.  Factors  associated 
with a greater risk of acute GVHD include HLA-mismatching between 
recipient and donor, patient and donor age, use of more intense pre-
parative regimens, and use of multiparous women as donors. Presum-
ably,  multiparous  women  have  more  alloreactivity  based  on  carriage 
of genetically disparate fetuses. Disruption of the intestinal microbiota 
leading to loss of diversity and overgrowth by a single taxon is associ-
ated with a higher risk of GVHD and transplant-associated mortality. 
Biomarkers, including ST2, REG32, and TNF R1, have been identified 
that predict the severity of acute GVHD. The disease is usually treated 
with  prednisone  at  a  daily  dose  of  1–2  mg/kg.  Patients  in  whom  the 
acute GVHD fails to respond to prednisone sometimes respond to the 
oral JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib.

Chronic  GVHD  occurs  most  commonly  between  3  months  and  
2 years after allogeneic transplant, developing in 20–50% of recipients. 
The disease is more common in older patients, with the use of periph-
eral blood rather than marrow as the stem cell source, in recipients of 
mismatched or unrelated stem cells, and in those with a preceding epi-
sode of acute GVHD. The disease resembles an autoimmune disorder 
with  malar  rash,  sicca  syndrome,  arthritis,  obliterative  bronchiolitis, 
and bile duct degeneration with cholestasis. Mild chronic GVHD can 
sometimes  be  managed  using  local  therapies  (topical  glucocorticoids 
to skin and cyclosporine eye drops). More severe disease requires sys-
temic  therapy  usually  with  prednisone  alone  or  in  combination  with 
cyclosporine.  Ibrutinib  is  sometimes  effective  in  patients  whose  dis-
ease does not respond to initial therapy. Mortality rates from chronic 
GVHD average around 15%, but range from 5 to 50% depending on 
severity. In most patients, chronic GVHD resolves, but it may require 
1–3  years  of  immunosuppressive  treatment  before  these  agents  can 
be  withdrawn  without  the  disease  recurring.  Because  patients  with 
chronic  GVHD  are  susceptible  to  significant  infection,  they  should 
receive prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and all suspected 
infections should be investigated and treated aggressively.

Although  onset  before  or  after  3  months  after  transplant  is  often 
used  to  discriminate  between  acute  and  chronic  GVHD,  occasional 
patients  will  develop  signs  and  symptoms  of  acute  GVHD  after  
3 months (late-onset acute GVHD), whereas others will exhibit signs

PART 4Oncology and Hematologyand symptoms of both acute and chronic GVHD (overlap syndrome). 
There are as yet no data to suggest that these patients should be treated 
differently than those with classic acute or chronic GVHD.

From 3 to 5% of patients will develop an autoimmune disorder fol-
lowing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, most commonly 
autoimmune  hemolytic  anemia  or  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  pur-
pura. Unrelated donor source and chronic GVHD are risk factors, but 
autoimmune disorders have been reported in patients with no obvious 
GVHD. Treatment is with prednisone, cyclosporine, or rituximab.

Infection  Posttransplant  patients,  particularly  recipients  of  allo-
geneic  transplantation,  require  unique  approaches  to  the  problem  of 
infection.  Early  after  transplantation,  patients  are  profoundly  neu-
tropenic, and because the risk of bacterial infection is so great, most 
centers  place  patients  on  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  once  the  gran-
ulocyte  count  falls  to  <500/μL.  Prophylaxis  against  fungal  infections 
reduces rates of infection and improves overall survival. Fluconazole is 
often used for patients with standard risk, while prophylaxis with mold 
active  agents  (voriconazole  or  posaconazole)  should  be  considered 
for  patients  at  higher  risk,  such  as  those  with  a  prior  fungal  infec-
tion.  Patients  seropositive  for  herpes  simplex  should  receive  acyclo-
vir  prophylaxis.  One  approach  to  infection  prophylaxis  is  shown  in  
Table 114-3. Despite these prophylactic measures, most patients will 
develop fever and signs of infection after transplant. The management 
of patients who become febrile despite bacterial and fungal prophylaxis 
is a difficult challenge and is guided by individual aspects of the patient 
and by the institution’s experience.

The general problem of infection in the immunocompromised host 

is discussed in Chap. 143.

Once  patients  engraft,  the  incidence  of  bacterial  infection  dimin-
ishes;  however,  patients,  particularly  allogeneic  transplant  recipients, 
remain at significant risk of infection. During the period from engraft-
ment until about 3 months after transplant, the most common causes 
of infection are gram-positive bacteria, fungi (particularly Aspergillus), 
and viruses including CMV. CMV disease, which in the past was fre-
quently seen and often fatal, can be prevented in seronegative patients 
transplanted from seronegative donors by the use of either seronegative 
blood  products  or  products  from  which  the  white  blood  cells  have 
been  removed.  In  seropositive  patients  or  patients  transplanted  from 
seropositive donors, either prophylaxis or preemptive therapy is used. 
Letermovir  administered  over  the  first  3  months  after  transplant  is 
effective as prophylaxis. An alternative approach is to monitor blood 
of  patients  after  transplant  using  polymerase  chain  reaction  assays 
for viral DNA and to treat reactivation preemptively with ganciclovir 
before clinical disease develops. Foscarnet is effective for some patients 
who develop CMV antigenemia or infection despite the use of ganci-
clovir  or  who  cannot  tolerate  the  drug,  but  it  can  be  associated  with 
severe electrolyte wasting.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, once seen in 5–10% of patients, 
can  be  prevented  by  treating  patients  with  oral  trimethoprim- 
sulfamethoxazole for 1 week before transplant and resuming the treat-
ment once patients engraft.

Respiratory viruses that cause community-acquired infections, includ-
ing  respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV),  parainfluenza  virus,  influenza 
virus, and metapneumovirus, can be life threatening or fatal in the post-
transplant patient. Protection of patients from infected visitors and staff 
by avoiding such contacts is critical. Neuraminidase inhibitors are effec-
tive for influenza infections. Inhaled ribavirin is sometimes used for RSV.
The  risk  of  infection  diminishes  considerably  beyond  3  months 
after  transplant  unless  chronic  GVHD  requiring  continuous  immu-
nosuppression develops. Most transplant centers recommend contin-
uing  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  prophylaxis  while  patients  are 
receiving any immunosuppressive drugs and also recommend careful 
monitoring for late CMV reactivation. In addition, many centers rec-
ommend prophylaxis against varicella-zoster, using acyclovir for 1 year 
after transplant. Patients should be revaccinated against tetanus, diph-
theria, Haemophilus influenzae, polio, and pneumococcal pneumonia 
starting  at  12  months  after  transplant  and  against  measles,  mumps, 
and  rubella  (MMR),  varicella-zoster  virus,  and  possibly  pertussis  at 
24 months.

TREATMENT
Nonmalignant Diseases

Evidence-based  indications  for  hematopoietic  cell  transplantation 
have  been  published  by  several  organizations  and  are  guided  not 
only  by  disease-related  factors  but  also  by  patient  comorbidities, 
socioeconomic issues, caregiver and donor availability, and patient 
preference. 
IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISORDERS
By replacing abnormal stem cells with cells from a normal donor, 
hematopoietic cell transplantation can cure patients of a variety of 
immunodeficiency  disorders  including  severe  combined  immu-
nodeficiency,  Wiskott-Aldrich  syndrome,  and  Chédiak-Higashi 
syndrome. The widest experience is with severe combined immu-
nodeficiency  disease,  where  cure  rates  of  90%  can  be  expected 
with  HLA-identical  donors  and  success  rates  of  50–70%  have 
been  reported  using  haplotype-mismatched  parents  as  donors   
(Table 114-4). 
APLASTIC ANEMIA
Transplantation from matched siblings after a preparative regimen 
of high-dose cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin cures 
up  to  90%  of  patients  age  <40  years  with  severe  aplastic  anemia. 
Results  in  older  patients  and  in  recipients  of  mismatched  family 
member  or  unrelated  marrow  are  less  favorable;  therefore,  a  trial 
of immunosuppressive therapy is generally recommended for such 
patients before considering transplantation. Transplantation is effec-
tive in all forms of aplastic anemia including, for example, the syn-
dromes associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and 
Fanconi’s  anemia.  Patients  with  Fanconi’s  anemia  are  abnormally 
sensitive to the toxic effects of alkylating agents, and so less intensive 
preparative regimens are used in their treatment (Chap. 102). 
HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES
Marrow  transplantation  from  an  HLA-identical  sibling  following 
a preparative regimen of busulfan and cyclophosphamide can cure 
80–90%  of  patients  with  thalassemia  major.  The  best  outcomes 
can  be  expected  if  patients  are  transplanted  before  they  develop 
hepatomegaly  or  portal  fibrosis  and  if  they  have  been  given  ade-
quate iron chelation therapy. Among such patients, the probabilities 
of 5-year survival and disease-free survival are 95 and 90%, respec-
tively. Although prolonged survival can be achieved with aggressive 
chelation  therapy,  transplantation  is  the  only  curative  treatment 
for thalassemia. Transplantation is potentially curative for patients 
with sickle cell anemia. Two-year survival and disease-free survival 
rates  of  95  and  85%,  respectively,  have  been  reported  following 
matched  sibling  or  cord  blood  transplantation.  Decisions  about 
patient selection and the timing of transplantation remain difficult, 
but transplantation is a reasonable option for children and young

adults who have suffered complications of sickle cell anemia includ-
ing stroke, recurrent vasoocclusive pain, sickle cell lung disease, or 
sickle nephropathy (Chap. 98). 
OTHER NONMALIGNANT DISEASES
Theoretically, hematopoietic cell transplantation should be able to 
cure any disease that results from an inborn error of the lymphohe-
matopoietic system. Transplantation has been used successfully to 
treat congenital disorders of white blood cells such as Kostmann’s 
syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, and leukocyte adhesion 
deficiency. Congenital anemias such as Blackfan-Diamond anemia 
can also be cured with transplantation. Since the penetrance of some 
congenital marrow failure states is variable, potential family mem-
ber donors should be carefully screened before use to assure they are 
not affected. Infantile malignant osteopetrosis is due to an inability 
of the osteoclast to resorb bone, and because osteoclasts derive from 
the marrow, transplantation can cure this rare inherited disorder.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation has been used as treatment for 
a number of storage diseases caused by enzymatic deficiencies, such 
as  Gaucher’s  disease,  Hurler’s  syndrome,  Hunter’s  syndrome,  and 
infantile  metachromatic  leukodystrophy.  Transplantation  for  these 
diseases has not been uniformly successful, but treatment early in 
the course of these diseases, before irreversible damage to extramed-
ullary organs has occurred, increases the chance for success.

Transplantation is being explored as a treatment for severe acquired 
autoimmune disorders. These trials are based on studies demonstrat-
ing that transplantation can reverse autoimmune disorders in animal 
models and on the observation that occasional patients with coexist-
ing autoimmune disorders and hematologic malignancies have been 
cured of both with transplantation. A prospective randomized trial 
found that patients with severe scleroderma have improved event-free 
and overall survival if treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation. 

ACUTE LEUKEMIA
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  cell  transplantation  cures  15–20%  of 
patients  who  do  not  achieve  complete  response  after  induction 
chemotherapy  for  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  and  is  the  only 
form of therapy that can cure such patients. Thus, all patients with 
AML  who  are  possible  transplant  candidates  should  have  their 
HLA  type  determined  soon  after  diagnosis  to  enable  hematopoi-
etic cell transplantation for those who fail to enter remission. Cure 
rates of 30–35% are seen when patients are transplanted in second 
remission or in first relapse. The best results with allogeneic trans-
plantation  are  achieved  when  applied  during  first  remission,  with 
disease-free  survival  rates  averaging  55–60%.  Meta-analyses  of 
studies  comparing  matched  related  donor  transplantation  to  che-
motherapy  for  adult  AML  patients  age  <60  years  show  a  survival 
advantage with transplantation. This advantage is greatest for those 
with unfavorable-risk AML and is lost in those with favorable-risk 
disease. While hematopoietic cell transplantation can be performed 
in patients up to age 75 and possibly beyond, prospective trials com-
paring  hematopoietic  cell  transplantation  with  chemotherapy  are 
lacking for older patients. The role of autologous transplantation in 
the treatment of AML is less well defined. The rates of disease recur-
rence  with  autologous  transplantation  are  higher  than  those  seen 
after allogeneic transplantation, and cure rates are somewhat less.

Similar  to  patients  with  AML,  adults  with  acute  lymphocytic 
leukemia  who  do  not  achieve  a  complete  response  to  induction 
chemotherapy  can  be  cured  in  15–20%  of  cases  with  immediate 
transplantation.  Cure  rates  improve  to  30–50%  in  second  remis-
sion, and therefore, transplantation can be recommended for adults 
who  have  persistent  disease  after  induction  chemotherapy  or  who 
subsequently  relapse.  Transplantation  in  first  remission  results  in 
cure  rates  of  about  55%.  Transplantation  appears  to  offer  a  sur-
vival advantage over chemotherapy for patients with high-risk dis-
ease  as  defined  by  molecular  profiling.  Debate  continues  about 
whether  adults  with  standard-risk  disease  should  be  transplanted 
in  first  remission  or  whether  transplantation  should  be  reserved 
until relapse. Autologous transplantation is associated with a higher 
relapse rate but a somewhat lower risk of nonrelapse mortality when 
compared to allogeneic transplantation. There is no obvious role of 
autologous transplantation for acute lymphocytic leukemia in first 
remission, and for second-remission patients, most experts recom-
mend use of allogeneic stem cells if an appropriate donor is available. 

CHRONIC LEUKEMIA
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  cell  transplantation  is  indicated  for 
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are in chronic 
phase  but  have  failed  therapy  with  two  or  more  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors.  In  such  patients,  cure  rates  of  70%  can  be  expected. 
Hematopoietic cell transplantation is also recommended for patients 
with CML who present or progress to accelerated phase or blast cri-
sis, although lower cure rates are seen in such patients (Chap. 105).
Although  allogeneic  transplantation  can  cure  patients  with 
chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL),  it  has  not  been  extensively 
studied because of the chronic nature of the disease, the age profile 
of patients, and more recently, the availability of multiple effective 
therapies. In those cases where it was studied, complete remissions 
were achieved in the majority of patients, with disease-free survival 
rates of ~50% at 3 years, despite the advanced stage of the disease at 
the time of transplant. 

MYELODYSPLASIA AND MYELOPROLIFERATIVE 
DISORDERS
Between 20 and 65% of patients with myelodysplasia appear to be 
cured  with  allogeneic  transplantation.  Results  are  better  among 
younger  patients  and  those  with  less  advanced  disease.  However, 
patients  with  early-stage  myelodysplasia  can  live  for  extended 
periods  without  intervention,  and  so  transplantation  is  generally 
reserved  for  patients  with  an  International  Prognostic  Scoring 
System (IPSS) score of Int-2 or higher, or for selected patients with 
an  IPSS  score  of  Int-1  who  have  other  poor  prognostic  features

(Chap. 102). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can cure 
patients with primary myelofibrosis or myelofibrosis secondary to 
polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, with 5-year pro-
gression-free survival rates in excess of 65% being reported. It may 
require many months for the fibrosis to resolve. 

LYMPHOMA
Patients  with  disseminated  intermediate-  or  high-grade  non- 
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  who  have  not  been  cured  by  first-line   
chemotherapy and are transplanted in first relapse or second remis-
sion  can  still  be  cured  in  40–50%  of  cases.  This  represents  a  clear 
advantage  over  results  obtained  with  conventional-dose  salvage 
chemotherapy.  It  is  unsettled  whether  patients  with  high-risk  dis-
ease  benefit  from  transplantation  in  first  remission.  Most  experts 
favor  the  use  of  autologous  rather  than  allogeneic  transplantation 
for  patients  with  intermediate-  or  high-grade  non-Hodgkin’s  lym-
phoma, because fewer complications occur with this approach and 
survival  appears  equivalent.  Although  autologous  transplantation 
results in high response rates in patients with recurrent disseminated 
indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the availability of newer agents 
for this category of patient leaves the role of transplantation unset-
tled.  Reduced-intensity  conditioning  regimens  followed  by  alloge-
neic transplantation result in high rates of complete and enduring 
complete responses in patients with recurrent indolent lymphomas.
The role of transplantation in Hodgkin’s disease is similar to that 
in  intermediate-  and  high-grade  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma.  With 
transplantation,  5-year  disease-free  survival  is  20–30%  in  patients 
who  never  achieve  a  first  remission  with  standard  chemotherapy 
and up to 70% for those transplanted in second remission. Trans-
plantation has no defined role in first remission in Hodgkin’s disease. 

MYELOMA
Patients  with  myeloma  whose  disease  progresses  after  first-line 
therapy can sometimes benefit from allogeneic or autologous trans-
plantation.  Prospective  randomized  studies  demonstrate  that  the 
inclusion  of  autologous  transplantation  as  part  of  initial  therapy 
results in improved disease-free survival and overall survival. Fur-
ther  benefit  is  seen  with  the  use  of  lenalidomide  maintenance 
therapy following transplantation. The use of autologous transplan-
tation followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation has 
yielded mixed results. 
SOLID TUMORS
Patients  with  testicular  cancer  in  whom  first-line  platinum- 
containing chemotherapy has failed can still be cured in ~50% of cases 
if  treated  with  high-dose  chemotherapy  with  autologous  stem  cell 
support,  an  outcome  better  than  that  seen  with  low-dose  salvage 
chemotherapy. The use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous 
stem  cell  support  is  being  studied  for  several  other  solid  tumors, 
including neuroblastoma and pediatric sarcomas. As in most other 
settings,  the  best  results  were  obtained  in  patients  with  limited 
amounts of disease and in whom the remaining tumor remains sen-
sitive to conventional-dose chemotherapy. Few randomized trials of 
transplantation in these diseases have been completed. 

POSTTRANSPLANT RELAPSE
Patients  who  relapse  following  autologous  transplantation  some-
times  respond  to  further  chemotherapy  and  may  be  candidates 
for  possible  allogeneic  transplantation,  particularly  if  the  remis-
sion  following  the  initial  autologous  transplant  was  long.  Several 
options are available for patients who relapse following allogeneic 
transplantation.  Treatment  with  infusions  of  unirradiated  donor 
lymphocytes  results  in  complete  responses  in  as  many  as  75%  of 
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, 40% with myelodysplasia, 
25%  with  AML,  and  15%  with  myeloma.  Major  complications  of 
donor  lymphocyte  infusions  include  transient  myelosuppression 
and the development of GVHD. These complications depend on the 
number of donor lymphocytes given and the schedule of infusions, 
with less GVHD seen with lower dose, fractionated schedules.

Section 3  Disorders of Hemostasis

115 Disorders of Platelets 
and Vessel Wall
Barbara A. Konkle

Hemostasis is a dynamic process in which the platelet and the blood 
vessel wall play key roles. Platelets are activated upon adhesion to von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) and collagen in the exposed subendothelium 
after  injury.  Platelet  activation  is  also  mediated  through  shear  forces 
imposed by blood flow itself, particularly in areas where the vessel wall 
is diseased, and is also affected by the inflammatory state of the endo-
thelium. The activated platelet surface provides the major physiologic 
site for coagulation factor activation, which results in further platelet 
activation  and  fibrin  formation.  Genetic  and  acquired  influences  on 
the platelet and vessel wall, as well as on the coagulation and fibrino-
lytic  systems,  determine  whether  normal  hemostasis  or  bleeding  or 
clotting symptoms will result.

THE PLATELET
Platelets are released from the megakaryocyte, likely under the influ-
ence of flow in the capillary sinuses. The normal blood platelet count is 
150,000–450,000/μL. The major regulator of platelet production is the 
hormone thrombopoietin (TPO), which is synthesized in the liver and 
other organs. Synthesis is increased with inflammation and specifically 
by interleukin 6. TPO binds to its receptor on platelets and megakary-
ocytes, by which it is removed from the circulation. Thus, a reduction 
in platelet and megakaryocyte mass increases the level of TPO, which 
then stimulates platelet production. Platelets circulate with an average 
life span of 7–10 days. Approximately one-third of the platelets reside 
in the spleen, and this number increases in proportion to splenic size, 
although the platelet count rarely decreases to <40,000/μL as the spleen

enlarges. Platelets are physiologically very active, but are anucleate, and 
thus have limited capacity to synthesize new proteins.

Normal vascular endothelium contributes to preventing thrombosis 
by inhibiting platelet function (Chap. 65). When vascular endothelium 
is injured, these inhibitory effects are overcome, and platelets adhere to 
the exposed intimal surface primarily through VWF, a large multim-
eric protein present in both plasma and in the extracellular matrix of 
the subendothelial vessel wall. Platelet adhesion results in the genera-
tion of intracellular signals that lead to activation of the platelet glyco-
protein (Gp) IIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3) receptor and resultant platelet aggregation.
Activated platelets undergo release of their granule contents, which 
include nucleotides, adhesive proteins, growth factors, and procoagu-
lants that serve to promote platelet aggregation and blood clot forma-
tion and influence the environment of the forming clot. During platelet 
aggregation,  additional  platelets  are  recruited  to  the  site  of  injury, 
leading to the formation of an occlusive platelet thrombus. The platelet 
plug is stabilized by the fibrin mesh that develops simultaneously as the 
product of the coagulation cascade.

THE VESSEL WALL
Endothelial cells line the surface of the entire circulatory tree, totaling 
1–6 × 1013 cells, enough to cover a surface area equivalent to about six 
tennis  courts.  The  endothelium  is  physiologically  active,  controlling 
vascular permeability, flow of biologically active molecules and nutri-
ents,  blood  cell  interactions  with  the  vessel  wall,  the  inflammatory 
response, and angiogenesis.

The  endothelium  normally  presents  an  antithrombotic  surface 
(Chap.  65)  but  rapidly  becomes  prothrombotic  when  stimulated, 

which promotes coagulation, inhibits fibrinolysis, and activates plate-
lets. In many cases, endothelium-derived vasodilators are also platelet 
inhibitors  (e.g.,  nitric  oxide),  and  conversely,  endothelium-derived 
vasoconstrictors (e.g., endothelin) can also be platelet activators. The net 
effect of vasodilation and inhibition of platelet function is to promote 
blood  fluidity,  whereas  the  net  effect  of  vasoconstriction  and  platelet 
activation is to promote thrombosis. Thus, blood fluidity and hemosta-
sis  are  regulated  by  the  balance  of  antithrombotic/prothrombotic  and 
vasodilatory/vasoconstrictor properties of endothelial cells.

DISORDERS OF PLATELETS
 ■ THROMBOCYTOPENIA
Thrombocytopenia  results  from  one  or  more  of  three  processes:  (1) 
decreased  bone  marrow  production;  (2)  sequestration,  usually  in  an 
enlarged spleen; and/or (3) increased platelet destruction. Disorders of 
production may be either inherited or acquired. In evaluating a patient 
with  thrombocytopenia,  a  key  step  is  to  review  the  peripheral  blood 
smear and to first rule out “pseudothrombocytopenia,” particularly in 
a patient without an apparent cause for the thrombocytopenia. Pseu-
dothrombocytopenia (Fig. 115-1B) is an in vitro artifact resulting from 
platelet  agglutination  via  antibodies  (usually  IgG,  but  also  IgM  and 
IgA) when the calcium content is decreased by blood collection in eth-
ylenediamine  tetraacetic  (EDTA)  (the  anticoagulant  present  in  tubes 
[purple top] used to collect blood for complete blood counts [CBCs]). 
If  a  low  platelet  count  is  obtained  in  EDTA-anticoagulated  blood,  a 
blood  smear  should  be  evaluated  and  a  platelet  count  determined  in 
blood collected into sodium citrate (blue top tube) or heparin (green

as from a finger stick, can be examined.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
Thrombocytopenia

The  history  and  physical  examination,  results  of  the  CBC,  and 
review of the peripheral blood smear are all critical components in 
the  initial  evaluation  of  thrombocytopenic  patients  (Fig.  115-2). 
The overall health of the patient and whether he or she is receiving 
drug treatment will influence the differential diagnosis. A healthy 
young adult with thrombocytopenia will have a much more limited 
differential diagnosis than an ill hospitalized patient who is receiv-
ing  multiple  medications.  Except  in  unusual  inherited  disorders, 
decreased  platelet  production  usually  results  from  bone  marrow 
disorders that also affect red blood cell (RBC) and/or white blood 
cell  (WBC)  production.  Because  myelodysplasia  can  present  with 
isolated thrombocytopenia, the bone marrow should be examined 
in  patients  presenting  with  isolated  thrombocytopenia  who  are 
older than 60 years of age or who do not respond to initial therapy. 
While inherited thrombocytopenia is rare, any prior platelet counts 
should  be  retrieved  and  a  family  history  regarding  thrombocy-
topenia  obtained.  A  careful  history  of  drug  ingestion  should  be 
obtained, including nonprescription and herbal remedies, because 
drugs are the most common cause of thrombocytopenia.

The physical examination can document an enlarged spleen, evi-
dence of chronic liver disease, and other underlying disorders. Mild 
to moderate splenomegaly may be difficult to appreciate in many 
individuals  due  to  body  habitus  and/or  obesity  but  can  be  easily 
assessed  by  abdominal  ultrasound.  A  platelet  count  of  approxi-
mately 5000–10,000 is required to maintain vascular integrity in the 
microcirculation. When the count is markedly decreased, petechiae 
first  appear  in  areas  of  increased  venous  pressure,  the  ankles  and 
feet in an ambulatory patient. Petechiae are pinpoint, nonblanching 
hemorrhages and are usually a sign of a decreased platelet number

on  the  oral  mucosa,  are  thought  to  denote  an  increased  risk 
of  life-threatening  hemorrhage  in  the  thrombocytopenic  patient. 
Excessive bruising is seen in disorders of both platelet number and 
function.

905

Infection-Induced Thrombocytopenia  Many  viral  and  bacte-
rial infections result in thrombocytopenia and are the most common 
noniatrogenic  cause  of  thrombocytopenia.  This  may  or  may  not  be 
associated  with  laboratory  evidence  of  disseminated  intravascular 
coagulation  (DIC),  which  is  most  commonly  seen  in  patients  with 
systemic infections with gram-negative bacteria and is seen in patients 
ill with COVID-19. Infections can affect both platelet production and 
platelet  survival.  In  addition,  immune  mechanisms  can  be  at  work, 
as in infectious mononucleosis and early HIV infection. Late in HIV 
infection,  pancytopenia  and  decreased  and  dysplastic  platelet  pro-
duction  are  more  common.  Immune-mediated  thrombocytopenia  in 
children  usually  follows  a  viral  infection  and  almost  always  resolves 
spontaneously. This association of infection with immune thrombocy-
topenic purpura is less clear in adults.

Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia  Many drugs have been asso-
ciated with thrombocytopenia. A predictable decrease in platelet count 
occurs after treatment with many chemotherapeutic drugs due to bone 
marrow suppression (Chap. 73). Drugs that cause isolated thrombocy-
topenia and have been confirmed with positive laboratory testing are 
listed in Table 115-1, but all drugs should be suspect in a patient with 
thrombocytopenia without an apparent cause and should be stopped, 
or  substituted,  if  possible.  Although  not  as  well  studied,  herbal  and 
over-the-counter  preparations  may  also  result  in  thrombocytopenia 
and should be discontinued in patients who are thrombocytopenic.

Classic  drug-dependent  antibodies  are  antibodies  that  react  with 
specific platelet surface antigens and result in thrombocytopenia only 
when  the  drug  is  present.  Many  drugs  are  capable  of  inducing  these 
antibodies, but for some reason, they are more common with quinine 
and sulfonamides. Drug-dependent antibody binding can be demon-
strated by laboratory assays, showing antibody binding in the presence 
of, but not without, the drug present in the assay. The thrombocytope-
nia typically occurs after a period of initial exposure (median length 
21 days), or upon reexposure, and usually resolves in 7–10 days after 
drug withdrawal. The thrombocytopenia caused by the platelet Gp IIb/
IIIa  inhibitory  drugs,  such  as  abciximab,  differs  in  that  it  may  occur 
within 24 h of initial exposure. This appears to be due to the presence

to the platelet.

but higher specificity than the ELISA. However, HIT remains a clinical 
diagnosis.

Heparin-Induced  Thrombocytopenia  Drug-induced  throm-
bocytopenia  due  to  heparin  differs  from  that  seen  with  other  drugs 
in  two  major  ways.  (1)  The  thrombocytopenia  is  not  usually  severe, 
with  nadir  counts  rarely  <20,000/μL.  (2)  Heparin-induced  thrombo-
cytopenia (HIT) is not associated with bleeding and, in fact, markedly 
increases the risk of thrombosis. The pathogenesis of HIT is complex. 
It results from antibody formation to a complex of the platelet-specific 
protein  platelet  factor  4  (PF4)  and  heparin  or  other  glycosaminogly-
cans. The anti-heparin/PF4 antibody can activate platelets through the 
FcγRIIa  receptor  and  also  activate  monocytes,  endothelial  cells,  and 
coagulation proteins. Many patients exposed to heparin develop anti-
bodies to heparin/PF4 but do not appear to have adverse consequences. 
A  fraction  of  those  who  develop  antibodies  will  develop  HIT,  and  a 
portion of those (up to 50%) will develop thrombosis (HITT).

HIT  can  occur  after  exposure  to  low-molecular-weight  heparin 
(LMWH)  as  well  as  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH),  although  it  is 
more common with the latter. Most patients develop HIT after expo-
sure to heparin for 5–14 days (Fig. 115-3). It occurs before 5 days in 
those who were exposed to heparin in the prior few weeks or months 
(<~100 days) and have circulating anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies. Rarely, 
thrombocytopenia and thrombosis begin several days after all heparin 
has been stopped (termed delayed-onset HIT), and more rarely, spon-
taneous  HIT,  or  autoimmune  HIT  syndrome,  occurs  where  there  is 
no  history  of  heparin  exposure  and  termed  vaccine-induced  immune 
thrombocytopenia  and  thrombosis  (VITT).  A  syndrome  similar  to 
spontaneous HIT has been described rarely post-COVID-19 vaccina-
tion  mainly  with  the  ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19  vaccine.  The  “4T’s”  have 
been  recommended  to  be  used  in  a  diagnostic  algorithm  for  HIT: 
thrombocytopenia, timing of platelet count drop, thrombosis and other 
sequelae such as localized skin reactions, and other causes of throm-
bocytopenia not evident. Application of the 4T scoring system is very 
useful in excluding a diagnosis of HIT but will result in overdiagnosis 
of HIT in situations where thrombocytopenia and thrombosis due to 
other etiologies are common, such as in the intensive care unit. Alter-
native scoring systems have been recommended, including for patients 
after cardiopulmonary bypass.
LABORATORY TESTING FOR HIT  Because of the prevalence of antihep-
arin antibodies without clinical disease, testing should be done in indi-
viduals who are at intermediate or high risk based on clinical pretest 
assessment. HIT (anti-heparin/PF4) antibodies can be detected using 
two  types  of  assays.  The  most  widely  available  is  an  enzyme-linked 
immunoassay  (ELISA)  with  PF4/polyanion  complex  as  the  antigen. 
Because many patients develop antibodies but do not develop clinical 
HIT, the test has a low specificity for the diagnosis of HIT. This is espe-
cially true in patients who have undergone surgery requiring cardio-
pulmonary bypass, where approximately 50% of patients develop these 
antibodies postoperatively. IgG-specific ELISAs increase specificity but 
may decrease sensitivity. The other assay is a platelet activation assay, 
most commonly the serotonin release assay, which measures the ability 
of  the  patient’s  serum  to  activate  platelets  in  the  presence  of  heparin 
in a concentration-dependent manner. This test has lower sensitivity

Days of heparin (UFH or LMWH) exposure

FIGURE 115-3  Time course of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) development 
after heparin exposure. The timing of development after heparin exposure is a critical 
factor in determining the likelihood of HIT in a patient. HIT occurs early after heparin 
exposure in the presence of preexisting heparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies, 
which disappear from circulation by ~100 days following a prior exposure. Rarely, 
HIT  may  occur  later  after  heparin  exposure  (termed  delayed-onset  HIT).  In  this 
setting,  heparin/PF4  antibody  testing  is  usually  markedly  positive.  HIT  can  occur 
after  exposure  to  either  unfractionated  (UFH)  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin 
(LMWH).

TREATMENT
Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia

Early recognition is key in treatment of HIT, with prompt discontin-
uation of heparin and use of alternative anticoagulants if bleeding 
risk does not outweigh thrombotic risk. Thrombosis is a common 
complication  of  HIT,  even  after  heparin  discontinuation,  and  can 
occur in both the venous and arterial systems. In patients diagnosed 
with HIT, imaging studies to evaluate the patient for thrombosis (at 
least lower extremity duplex Doppler imaging) are recommended. 
Patients requiring anticoagulation should be switched from hepa-
rin  to  an  alternative  anticoagulant.  The  direct  thrombin  inhibitor 
(DTI) argatroban is effective in HITT. The DTI bivalirudin and the  
antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide fondaparinux are also effec-
tive but not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)  for  this  indication.  Direct  oral  anticoagulants  (DOACs) 
are being used for treatment, although they are not FDA approved 
for  this  indication.  Studies  in  small  numbers  of  patients  suggest 
their  use  in  this  setting  may  be  a  viable  option.  HIT  antibodies 
cross-react with LMWH, and these drugs should not be used in the 
treatment of HIT.

Because of the high rate of thrombosis in patients with HIT, anti-
coagulation  should  be  considered,  even  in  the  absence  of  throm-
bosis.  In  patients  with  thrombosis,  anticoagulation  is  continued 
for 3–6 months, but in patients without thrombosis, the duration 
of anticoagulation is less well defined. An increased risk of throm-
bosis is present for at least 1 month after diagnosis; however, most 
thromboses  occur  early,  and  whether  thrombosis  occurs  later  if 
the patient is initially anticoagulated is unknown. Options include 
continuing anticoagulation until a few days after platelet recovery 
or for 1 month. Introduction of warfarin alone in the setting of HIT 
or HITT may precipitate thrombosis, particularly venous gangrene, 
presumably due to clotting activation and severely reduced levels of 
proteins C and S. Warfarin therapy, if started, should be overlapped 
with  a  DTI  or  fondaparinux  and  started  after  resolution  of  the 
thrombocytopenia  and  lessening  of  the  prothrombotic  state.  Evi-
dence for use of an oral direct Xa inhibitor in this setting is growing.
The  rare  VITT  syndrome  is  characterized  by  high  D-dimer 
levels  and  thrombosis  in  unusual  sites  like  the  cerebral  venous 
sinuses.  Fatal  in  about  20%,  treatment  is  usually  IgIV  to  block 
platelet activation through Fc receptors, the pathogenic effect of the 
anti-PF4-polyanion antibody.

Immune  Thrombocytopenic  Purpura 
Immune  thrombocy-
topenic  purpura  (ITP;  also  termed  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  pur-
pura)  is  an  acquired  disorder  in  which  there  is  immune-mediated 
destruction of platelets and possibly inhibition of platelet release from 
the  megakaryocyte.  In  children,  it  is  usually  an  acute  disease,  most 
commonly  following  an  infection,  and  with  a  self-limited  course.  In 
adults, it is a more chronic disease, although in some adults, sponta-
neous  remission  occurs,  usually  within  months  of  diagnosis.  ITP  is 
termed secondary if it is associated with an underlying disorder; auto-
immune  disorders,  particularly  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE), 
and infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C, are common causes. The 
association  of  ITP  with  Helicobacter  pylori  infection  is  unclear  but 
appears to have a geographic distribution.

ITP  is  characterized  by  mucocutaneous  bleeding  and  a  low,  often 
very  low,  platelet  count,  with  an  otherwise  normal  peripheral  blood 
cells  and  smear.  Patients  usually  present  either  with  ecchymoses  and 
petechiae  or  with  thrombocytopenia  incidentally  found  on  a  routine 
CBC. Mucocutaneous bleeding, such as oral mucosa, gastrointestinal, 
or heavy menstrual bleeding, may be present. Rarely, life-threatening, 
including  central  nervous  system,  bleeding  can  occur.  Wet  purpura 
(blood  blisters  in  the  mouth)  and  retinal  hemorrhages  may  herald 
life-threatening bleeding.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyLABORATORY TESTING IN ITP  Laboratory testing for antibodies (sero-
logic  testing)  is  usually  not  helpful  due  to  the  low  sensitivity  and 
specificity  of  the  current  tests.  Bone  marrow  examination  can  be 
reserved  for  those  who  have  other  signs  or  laboratory  abnormalities 
not  explained  by  ITP  or  in  patients  who  do  not  respond  to  initial 
therapy.  The  peripheral  blood  smear  may  show  large  platelets,  with 
otherwise normal morphology. Depending on the bleeding history, iron- 
deficiency anemia may be present.

Laboratory testing is performed to evaluate for secondary causes of 
ITP and should include testing for HIV infection and hepatitis C (and 
other infections if indicated). Serologic testing for SLE, serum protein 
electrophoresis, immunoglobulin levels to potentially detect hypogam-
maglobulinemia,  selective  testing  for  IgA  deficiency  or  monoclonal 
gammopathies, and testing for H. pylori infection should be considered, 
depending  on  the  clinical  circumstance.  If  anemia  is  present,  direct 
antiglobulin  testing  (Coombs’  test)  should  be  performed  to  rule  out 
combined autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ITP (Evans’ syndrome).

TREATMENT
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura

The treatment of ITP uses drugs that decrease reticuloendothelial 
uptake of the antibody-bound platelet, decrease antibody produc-
tion, and/or increase platelet production. The diagnosis of ITP does 
not  necessarily  mean  that  treatment  must  be  instituted.  Patients 
with platelet counts >30,000/μL appear not to have increased mor-
tality related to the thrombocytopenia.

Initial treatment in patients without significant bleeding symp-
toms, severe thrombocytopenia (<5000/μL), or signs of impending 
bleeding  (e.g.,  retinal  hemorrhage  or  large  oral  mucosal  hemor-
rhages) can be instituted as an outpatient using single agents. Tra-
ditionally, this has been prednisone at 1 mg/kg or a 4-day course 
of  dexamethasone,  40  mg/d,  although  Rh0(D)  immune  globulin 
therapy (WinRho SDF), at 50–75 μg/kg, is also being used in this 
setting. Rh0(D) immune globulin must be used only in Rh-positive 
patients because the mechanism of action is production of limited 
hemolysis, with antibody-coated cells “saturating” the Fc receptors, 
inhibiting  Fc  receptor  function.  Monitoring  patients  for  8  h  after 
infusion is now advised by the FDA because of the rare complica-
tion of severe intravascular hemolysis. Intravenous gamma globulin 
(IVIgG), which is pooled, primarily IgG antibodies, also blocks the 
Fc receptor system, but appears to work primarily through different 
mechanism(s).  IVIgG  has  more  efficacy  than  anti-Rh0(D)  in  pos-
tsplenectomized  patients.  IVIgG  is  dosed  at  1–2  g/kg  total,  given 
over 1–5 days. Side effects are usually related to the volume of infu-
sion and infrequently include aseptic meningitis and renal failure. 
All immunoglobulin preparations are derived from human plasma 
and undergo treatment for viral inactivation.

For  patients  with  severe  ITP  and/or  symptoms  of  bleeding, 
hospital admission is required, and combined-modality therapy is 
given  using  high-dose  glucocorticoids  with  IVIgG  or  anti-Rh0(D) 
therapy and, as needed, additional immunosuppressive agents. Rit-
uximab, an anti-CD20 (B cell) antibody, has shown efficacy in the 
treatment  of  refractory  ITP,  although  long-lasting  remission  only 
occurs in approximately 30% of patients.

TPO  receptor  agonists,  one  administered  subcutaneously  (romi-
plostim)  and  another  orally  (eltrombopag),  are  effective  in  raising 
platelet counts in patients with ITP and are recommended for patients 
who relapse or who are unresponsive to at least one other therapy.

Other immunosuppressive drugs have also been tested. The com-
bination of glucocorticoids with mycophenolate mofetil (500 mg PO 
bid, increasing to 1000 mg PO bid as tolerated) appears to be more 
effective than glucocorticoids alone.

Splenectomy has been used for treatment of patients who relapse 
after  glucocorticoids  are  tapered  and  remains  a  treatment  option. 
However, with the recognition that ITP will resolve spontaneously 
in  some  adult  patients,  observation,  if  the  platelet  count  is  high 
enough,  or  intermittent  treatment  with  anti-Rh0(D)  or  IVIgG,  or 

initiation of treatment with a TPO receptor agonist may be a rea-
sonable approach to see if the ITP will resolve, prior to splenectomy 
or  other  therapies.  Vaccination  against  encapsulated  organisms 
(especially  pneumococcus,  but  also  meningococcus  and  Haemo-
philus influenzae, depending on patient age and potential exposure) 
is recommended before splenectomy. Accessory spleens are a very 
rare cause of relapse.

Inherited  Thrombocytopenia  Thrombocytopenia  is  rarely 
inherited, either as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome, and 
may  be  inherited  in  an  autosomal  dominant,  autosomal  recessive,  or 
X-linked  pattern.  Many  forms  of  autosomal  dominant  macrothrom-
bocytopenia are now known to be associated with variants in the non-
muscle  myosin  heavy  chain  MYH9  gene.  Interestingly,  these  include 
the May-Hegglin anomaly, and Sebastian, Epstein’s, and Fechtner syn-
dromes, all of which have distinct distinguishing features. A common 
feature  of  these  disorders  is  large  platelets  (Fig.  115-1C).  Autosomal 
recessive  disorders  include  congenital  amegakaryocytic  thrombocy-
topenia,  thrombocytopenia  with  absent  radii,  and  Bernard-Soulier 
syndrome. The latter is primarily a functional platelet disorder due to 
absence of Gp Ib-IX-V, the VWF adhesion receptor. X-linked disorders 
include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and a dyshematopoietic syndrome 
resulting  from  a  mutation  in  GATA-1,  an  important  transcriptional 
regulator of hematopoiesis.

 ■ THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA 
AND HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic microangiopathies are a group of dis-
orders characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) 
defined by thrombocytopenia and fragmented RBCs (Fig. 115-1D) on 
peripheral blood smear, laboratory evidence of hemolysis (elevated lac-
tate dehydrogenase [LDH] and unconjugated bilirubin and decreased 
haptoglobin), and microvascular thrombosis. They include thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic  purpura  (TTP)  and  hemolytic-uremic  syndrome 
(HUS),  as  well  as  syndromes  complicating  bone  marrow  transplan-
tation,  certain  medications  and  infections,  pregnancy,  and  vasculitis. 
In DIC, although thrombocytopenia and microangiopathy are seen, a 
coagulopathy predominates, with consumption of clotting factors and 
fibrinogen resulting in an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and often 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The PT and aPTT are 
characteristically normal in TTP or HUS.

Thrombotic  Thrombocytopenic  Purpura  TTP  was  first 
described in 1924 by Eli Moschcowitz and characterized by a pentad 
of findings that include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombo-
cytopenia, renal failure, neurologic findings, and fever. The full-blown 
syndrome  is  less  commonly  seen  now,  probably  due  to  earlier  diag-
nosis. The introduction of treatment with plasma exchange markedly 
improved the prognosis in patients, with a decrease in mortality from 
85–100% to 10–30%.

The  pathogenesis  of  inherited  (Upshaw-Schulman  syndrome)  and 
idiopathic TTP (ITTP) is related to a deficiency of, or antibodies to, the 
metalloprotease  ADAMTS13,  which  cleaves  VWF.  VWF  is  normally 
secreted as ultra-large multimers, which are then cleaved by ADAMTS13. 
The persistence of ultra-large VWF molecules is thought to contribute to 
pathogenic platelet adhesion and aggregation (Fig. 115-4). This defect 
alone, however, is not sufficient to result in TTP because individuals 
with a congenital absence of ADAMTS13 develop TTP only episodi-
cally, including during first pregnancy. The level of ADAMTS13 activ-
ity, as well as antibodies to ADAMTS13, can be detected by laboratory 
assays, which play a critical role in the differential diagnosis of MAHA. 
ADAMTS13 activity levels of <10% are diagnostic of TTP.

Idiopathic  TTP  appears  to  be  more  common  in  women  than  in 
men.  No  geographic  or  racial  distribution  has  been  defined.  TTP  is 
more common in patients with HIV infection and in pregnant women. 
Medication-related  MAHA  may  be  secondary  to  antibody  formation 
(ticlopidine  and  possibly  clopidogrel)  or  direct  endothelial  toxicity 
(cyclosporine, mitomycin C, tacrolimus, quinine), although this is not 
always  so  clear,  and  fear  of  withholding  treatment,  as  well  as  lack  of

metalloproteinase called ADAMTS13. In TTP, the activity of the protease is inhibited, 
and the ultra-high-molecular-weight multimers of VWF initiate platelet aggregation 
and thrombosis.

other treatment alternatives, may result in initial application of plasma 
exchange.  However,  withdrawal,  or  reduction  in  dose,  of  endothelial 
toxic agents usually decreases the microangiopathy.

TTP  relapses  should  be  initiated  before  confirmatory  laboratory 
assays are available.

Hemolytic-Uremic  Syndrome  HUS  is  a  syndrome  character-
ized  by  acute  renal  failure,  microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia,  and 
thrombocytopenia. It is seen preceded by an episode of diarrhea, often 
hemorrhagic  in  nature,  predominantly  in  children.  Escherichia  coli 
O157:H7  is  the  most  frequent,  although  not  only,  etiologic  serotype. 
HUS not associated with diarrhea is more heterogeneous in presenta-
tion and course. Atypical HUS (aHUS) is usually due to genetic defects 
in  complement  genes  or  antibodies  directed  against  complementary 
regulatory  proteins  that  result  in  chronic  complement  activation. 
Laboratory testing for DNA variants in complement regulatory genes 
is  available,  although  assigning  pathogenicity  to  variants  remains 
challenging. Currently, a commercially available functional assay is not 
available that is diagnostic of the disease.

TREATMENT
Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome

Treatment of HUS is primarily supportive. In HUS associated with 
diarrhea,  many  (~40%)  children  require  at  least  some  period  of 
support with dialysis; however, the overall mortality is <5%. In HUS 
not associated with diarrhea, the mortality is higher, approximately 
26%. Plasma infusion or plasma exchange has not been shown to 
alter  the  overall  course  in  HUS  or  aHUS,  except  in  patients  with 
antibodies to factor H. ADAMTS13 levels are generally reported to 
be normal in HUS, although occasionally they have been reported 
to be decreased. In patients with aHUS, eculizumab, a humanized 
monoclonal antibody against C5 that blocks terminal complement, 
has  efficacy  in  resolution  of  aHUS  and  improving  or  preserving 
renal  function.  Patients  with  aHUS  may  initially  be  treated  with 
plasma  exchange,  until  the  ADAMTS13  level  is  returned  and  the 
diagnosis is more clear, since aHUS remains a diagnosis of exclu-
sion. However, plasma exchange has not been shown to affect clin-
ical outcomes in aHUS.

TREATMENT
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

TTP is a devastating disease if not diagnosed and treated promptly. 
In patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia, with or without 
evidence of renal insufficiency and other elements of classic TTP, 
laboratory data (PT, aPTT, CBC with platelet count and peripheral 
smear,  ADAMTS13  activity,  LDH,  bilirubin,  haptoglobin,  direct 
antiglobulin assay) should be obtained to rule out DIC and to eval-
uate for evidence of MAHA.

Therapeutic  plasma  exchange  (TPE)  remains  the  mainstay  of 
treatment of TTP. TPE is continued until the platelet count is nor-
mal and signs of hemolysis are resolved for at least 2 days. Although 
never evaluated in clinical trials, the use of glucocorticoids seems 
a  reasonable  approach  but  should  only  be  used  as  an  adjunct  to 
plasma  exchange.  The  addition  of  rituximab  to  initial  therapy 
decreases  duration  of  TPE  and  relapses.  Caplacizumab,  an  anti-
VWF nanobody, decreases mortality and burden of care when used 
in patients with ADAMTS13 <10% or with high clinical probability 
of disease. Guidelines from the International Society of Thrombosis 
and Hemostasis recommend starting caplacizumab and rituximab 
only  in  individuals  with  diagnostic  ADAMTS13  levels  (usually 
<10%) and, additionally for rituximab, in patients with evidence of 
an inhibitor, given potential side effects and costs.

Patients  with  persistently  low  ADAMTS13  have  a  greater  risk 
of ongoing sequelae including stroke. There is a significant relapse 
rate; in patients treated with TPE, 25–45% of patients relapse within  
30  days  of  initial  “remission,”  and  12–40%  of  patients  have  late 
relapses.  Relapses  are  more  frequent  in  patients  with  severe 
ADAMTS13 deficiency at presentation. Treatment of patients with 

 ■ THROMBOCYTOSIS
Thrombocytosis  is  almost  always  due  to  (1)  iron  deficiency;  (2) 
inflammation,  cancer,  or  infection  (reactive  thrombocytosis);  or  (3) 
an underlying myeloproliferative process (essential thrombocythemia 
or polycythemia vera) (Chap. 103) or, rarely, the 5q– myelodysplastic 
process (Chap. 102). Patients presenting with an elevated platelet count 
should be evaluated for underlying inflammation and malignancy, and 
iron  deficiency  should  be  ruled  out.  Thrombocytosis  in  response  to 
acute  or  chronic  inflammation  has  not  been  clearly  associated  with 
an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, patients with markedly elevated 
platelet counts (>1.5 million), usually seen in the setting of a myelopro-
liferative disorder, have an increased risk of bleeding. This appears to 
be due, at least in part, to acquired von Willebrand disease (VWD) due 
to platelet-VWF binding and removal from the circulation.

 ■ QUALITATIVE DISORDERS OF PLATELET 
FUNCTION
Inherited  Disorders  of  Platelet  Function 
Inherited  platelet 
function disorders are thought to be relatively rare, although the prev-
alence of mild disorders of platelet function is unclear, in part because 
our testing for such disorders is suboptimal. Rare qualitative disorders 
include  the  autosomal  recessive  disorders  Glanzmann’s  thrombasthe-
nia (absence of the platelet Gp IIb/IIIa receptor) and Bernard-Soulier 
syndrome  (absence  of  the  platelet  Gp  Ib-IX-V  receptor).  Both  are 
inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and present with bleeding 
symptoms in childhood.

Platelet storage pool disorder (SPD) is the classic autosomal dom-
inant  qualitative  platelet  disorder.  This  results  from  abnormalities  of 
platelet granule formation. It is also seen as a part of inherited disorders 
of granule formation, such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Bleeding

PART 4Oncology and Hematologysymptoms in SPD are variable but often are mild. The most common 
inherited  disorders  of  platelet  function  prevent  normal  secretion  of 
granule content and are termed secretion defects. An increasing number 
of  genetic  variants  are  being  found  in  patients  with  these  disorders, 
although assigning pathogenicity remains challenging.

TREATMENT
Inherited Disorders of Platelet Dysfunction

Bleeding symptoms or prevention of bleeding in patients with severe 
platelet  dysfunction  frequently  requires  platelet  transfusion.  Care 
must be taken to limit the risk of alloimmunization by limiting expo-
sure and using HLA-matched single donor platelets for transfusion 
when needed. rFVIIa is FDA approved in Glanzmann’s thrombasthe-
nia and Bernard Soulier syndrome where use can avoid platelet allo-
imunization and anti-receptor antibody formation. Platelet disorders 
associated  with  milder  bleeding  symptoms  frequently  respond  to 
desmopressin  (1-deamino-8-d-arginine  vasopressin  [DDAVP]). 
DDAVP increases plasma VWF and factor VIII levels; it may also 
have  a  direct  effect  on  platelet  function.  Particularly  for  mucosal 
bleeding  symptoms,  antifibrinolytic  therapy  (tranexamic  acid  or 
ε-aminocaproic acid) is used alone or in conjunction with DDAVP 
or platelet therapy.

Acquired Disorders of Platelet Function  Acquired platelet dys-
function  is  common,  usually  due  to  medications,  either  intentionally 
as with antiplatelet therapy or unintentionally as with high-dose pen-
icillins. Acquired platelet dysfunction occurs in uremia. This is likely 
multifactorial, but the resultant effect is defective adhesion and activa-
tion. The platelet defect is improved most by dialysis but may also be 
improved by increasing the hematocrit to 27–32%, giving DDAVP (0.3 
μg/kg), or use of conjugated estrogens. Platelet dysfunction also occurs 
with cardiopulmonary bypass due to the effect of the artificial circuit on 
platelets, and bleeding symptoms respond to platelet transfusion. Plate-
let dysfunction seen with underlying hematologic disorders can result 
from  nonspecific  interference  by  circulating  paraproteins  or  intrinsic 
platelet defects in myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes.

 ■ VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE
VWD  is  the  most  common  inherited  bleeding  disorder,  with  preva-
lence of symptomatic disease of 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 individuals. 
VWF serves two roles: (1) as the major adhesion molecule that tethers 
the platelet to the exposed subendothelium; and (2) as the binding pro-
tein for factor VIII (FVIII), resulting in significant prolongation of the 
FVIII half-life in circulation. The platelet-adhesive function of VWF is 
critically dependent on the presence of large VWF multimers, whereas 
FVIII binding is not. Most of the symptoms of VWD are “platelet-like” 
except in more severe VWD when the FVIII is low enough to produce 
symptoms similar to those found in FVIII deficiency (hemophilia A).

VWD has been classified into three major types, with four subtypes 
of  type  2  (Table  115-2).  By  far,  the  most  common  type  of  VWD  is 
type  1  disease,  with  a  parallel  decrease  in  VWF  protein,  VWF  func-
tion,  and  FVIII  levels,  accounting  for  at  least  80%  of  cases.  In  type 
1  VWD,  patients  have  predominantly  mucosal  bleeding  symptoms, 
although postoperative bleeding can also be seen. Bleeding symptoms 
are uncommon in infancy and usually manifest later in childhood with 
excessive bruising and epistaxis. Because these symptoms occur com-
monly in childhood, the clinician should particularly note bruising at 
sites  unlikely  to  be  traumatized  and/or  prolonged  epistaxis  requiring 
medical attention. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common manifesta-
tion of VWD. Menstrual bleeding resulting in anemia should warrant 
an evaluation for VWD and, if negative, functional platelet disorders. 
Type 1 VWD may first manifest with dental extractions, particularly 
wisdom tooth extraction, or tonsillectomy.

Not  all  patients  with  low  VWF  levels  have  bleeding  symptoms. 
Whether patients bleed or not will depend on the overall hemostatic 
balance  they  have  inherited,  along  with  environmental  influences 
and the type of hemostatic challenges they experience. Although the

inheritance of VWD is autosomal, many factors modulate both VWF 
levels  and  bleeding  symptoms.  These  have  not  all  been  defined,  but 
include blood type, thyroid hormone status, race, stress, exercise, hor-
monal (both endogenous and exogenous) influences, and modulators 
of VWF clearance. Patients with type O blood have VWF protein levels 
of  approximately  one-half  those  of  patients  with  AB  blood  type,  and 
in fact, the normal range for patients with type O blood overlaps that 
which has been considered diagnostic for VWD. Patients with mildly 
decreased VWF levels should be diagnosed with VWD only in the set-
ting of bleeding symptoms and/or a family history of VWD.

Patients with type 2 VWD have functional defects; thus, the VWF 
antigen measurement is significantly higher than the test of function. 
For types 2A, 2B, and 2M VWD, platelet-binding and/or collagen-bind-
ing VWF activity is decreased. In type 2A VWD, the impaired function 
is  due  either  to  increased  susceptibility  to  cleavage  by  ADAMTS13, 
resulting in loss of intermediate- and high-molecular-weight multim-
ers,  or  to  decreased  production  of  these  multimers  by  the  cell.  Type 
2B  VWD  results  from  gain-of-function  DNA  variants  that  result  in 
increased ADAMTS13 cleavage and binding of VWF to platelets in cir-
culation, with subsequent clearance of this complex by the reticuloen-
dothelial system. The resulting VWF in the patients’ plasma lacks the 
highest molecular-weight multimers, and the platelet count is usually 
modestly reduced. Type 2M occurs as a consequence of a group of DNA 
variants that cause dysfunction but do not affect multimer structure.

Type 2N VWD is due to variants in the VWF gene that affect bind-
ing of FVIII. As FVIII is stabilized by binding to VWF, the FVIII in 
patients with type 2N VWD has a very short half-life, and the FVIII 
level  is  markedly  decreased.  This  is  sometimes  termed  autosomal 
hemophilia.  Type  3  VWD,  or  severe  VWD,  describes  patients  with 
virtually  no  VWF  protein  and  usually  FVIII  levels  <10%.  Patients 
experience mucosal and joint bleeding, surgery-related bleeding, and 
other  bleeding  symptoms.  Some  patients  with  type  3  VWD,  particu-
larly  those  with  large  VWF  gene  deletions,  are  at  risk  of  developing 
antibodies to infused VWF.

Acquired  VWD  or  von  Willebrand  syndrome  is  most  commonly 
seen in patients with underlying lymphoproliferative disorders, includ-
ing  monoclonal  gammopathies  of  underdetermined  significance 
(MGUS),  multiple  myeloma,  and  Waldenström’s  macroglobulinemia. 
It is seen most commonly in the setting of MGUS and should be sus-
pected  in  patients,  particularly  elderly  patients,  with  a  new  onset  of 
severe  mucosal  bleeding  symptoms.  Laboratory  evidence  of  acquired 
VWD is found in some patients with cardiac valvular disease. Heyde’s 
syndrome (aortic stenosis with gastrointestinal bleeding) is attributed 
to the presence of angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract in patients 
with  aortic  stenosis.  The  shear  stress  on  blood  passing  through  the 
stenotic aortic valve appears to unfold VWF, making it susceptible to 
proteolysis. Consequently, large multimer forms are lost, leading to an 
acquired type 2 VWD, but return when the stenotic valve is replaced.

TREATMENT
Von Willebrand Disease

The  mainstay  of  treatment  for  type  1  VWD  is  DDAVP  (desmo-
pressin), which results in release of VWF and FVIII from endothelial 
stores. DDAVP can be given intravenously, by high-concentration 
intranasal  spray  (1.5  mg/mL),  or  when  a  concentrated  form  is 
available, by subcutaneous injection. The peak activity when given 
intravenously  is  approximately  30  min,  whereas  it  is  2  h  when 
given intranasally. The usual dose is 0.3 μg/kg intravenously or two 
squirts (one in each nostril) for patients >50 kg (one squirt for those 
<50 kg). It is recommended that patients with VWD be tested with 
DDAVP  to  assess  their  response  before  using  it.  In  patients  who 
respond well (increase in laboratory values of two- to fourfold), it 
can be used for procedures with minor to moderate risk of bleeding. 
Depending on the procedure, additional doses may be needed; it is 
usually given every 12–24 h. Less frequent dosing may result in less 
tachyphylaxis,  which  occurs  when  synthesis  cannot  compensate 
for the released stores. The major side effect of DDAVP is hypona-
tremia  due  to  decreased  free  water  clearance.  This  occurs  most 
commonly in the very young and the very old, but fluid restriction 
should be advised for all patients for the 24 h following each dose.

Some patients with types 2A VWD respond to DDAVP such that 
it  can  be  used  for  minor  procedures.  For  the  other  subtypes,  for 
type 3 disease, and for major procedures requiring longer periods 
of normal hemostasis, VWF replacement can be given. Virally inac-
tivated VWF-plasma-derived and recombinant factor concentrates 
are safer than cryoprecipitate as the replacement product.

Antifibrinolytic therapy using either tranexamic acid (TXA) or 
ε-aminocaproic acid is an important therapy, either alone or in an 
adjunctive  capacity,  particularly  for  the  prevention  or  treatment 
of mucosal bleeding. These agents are particularly useful in treat-
ment of heavy menstrual bleeding (TXA 1300 mg every 8 h) and 
postpartum  hemorrhage,  as  prophylaxis  for  dental  procedures, 
and with DDAVP or factor concentrate for dental extractions, ton-
sillectomies,  and  prostate  procedures.  Antifibrinolytic  agents  are 
contraindicated in the setting of upper urinary tract bleeding due 
to the risk of ureteral obstruction.

 ■ DISORDERS OF THE VESSEL WALL
The vessel wall is an integral part of hemostasis, and separation of a 
fluid phase is artificial, particularly in disorders such as TTP or HIT 
that  clearly  involve  the  endothelium  as  well.  Inflammation  localized 
to  the  vessel  wall,  such  as  vasculitis,  and  inherited  connective  tissue 
disorders are abnormalities inherent to the vessel wall.

Metabolic and Inflammatory Disorders  Acute febrile illnesses 
may  result  in  vascular  damage.  This  can  result  from  immune  com-
plexes  containing  viral  antigens  or  the  viruses  themselves.  Certain 
pathogens,  such  as  the  rickettsiae  causing  Rocky  Mountain  spotted 
fever,  replicate  in  endothelial  cells  and  damage  them.  SARS-CoV-2 
also infects endothelial cells, resulting in activation and damage con-
tributing to COVID-19 pathogenicity. Vascular purpura may occur in 
patients with polyclonal gammopathies but more commonly occurs in 
those with monoclonal gammopathies, including Waldenström’s mac-
roglobulinemia,  multiple  myeloma,  and  cryoglobulinemia.  Patients 
with mixed cryoglobulinemia develop a more extensive maculopapular 
rash due to immune complex–mediated damage to the vessel wall.

Patients  with  scurvy  (vitamin  C  deficiency)  develop  painful  epi-
sodes of perifollicular skin bleeding as well as more systemic bleeding 
symptoms.  Vitamin  C  is  needed  to  synthesize  hydroxyproline,  an 
essential  constituent  of  collagen.  Patients  with  Cushing’s  syndrome 
or on chronic glucocorticoid therapy develop skin bleeding and easy 
bruising  due  to  atrophy  of  supporting  connective  tissue.  A  similar 
phenomenon is seen with aging, where following minor trauma, blood 
spreads superficially under the epidermis. This has been termed senile 
purpura. It is most common on skin that has been previously damaged 
by sun exposure.

Henoch-Schönlein,  or  anaphylactoid,  purpura  is  a  distinct,  self- 
limited  type  of  vasculitis  that  occurs  in  children  and  young  adults. 
Patients have an acute inflammatory reaction with IgA and complement 
components in capillaries, mesangial tissues, and small arterioles leading 
to increased vascular permeability and localized hemorrhage. The syn-
drome is often preceded by an upper respiratory infection, commonly 
with streptococcal pharyngitis, or is triggered by drug or food allergies. 
Patients develop a purpuric rash on the extensor surfaces of the arms 
and legs, usually accompanied by polyarthralgias or arthritis, abdominal 
pain, and hematuria from focal glomerulonephritis. All coagulation tests 
are normal, but renal impairment may occur. Glucocorticoids can pro-
vide symptomatic relief but do not alter the course of the illness.

Inherited Disorders of the Vessel Wall  Patients with inherited 
disorders of the connective tissue matrix, such as Marfan’s syndrome, 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, frequently 
report  easy  bruising.  Inherited  vascular  abnormalities  can  result  in 
increased  bleeding.  This  is  notably  seen  in  hereditary  hemorrhagic 
telangiectasia (HHT, or Osler-Weber-Rendu disease), a disorder where 
abnormal telangiectatic capillaries result in frequent bleeding episodes, 
primarily  from  the  nose  and  gastrointestinal  tract.  Arteriovenous 
malformation (AVM) in the lung, brain, and liver may also occur in 
HHT. The telangiectasia can often be visualized on the oral and nasal 
mucosa. Signs and symptoms develop over time. Epistaxis begins, on 
average, at the age of 12 and occurs in >95% of affected individuals by 
middle age. Approximately 25% have gastrointestinal bleeding usually 
beginning after the age of 50. HHT is caused by pathogenic DNA vari-
ants in number of genes involved in the TGFβ/BMP signaling cascade.

Jean M. Connors

Deficiencies  of  coagulation  factors  have  been  recognized  for  centu-
ries.  Patients  with  genetic  deficiencies  of  plasma  coagulation  factors 
exhibit  lifelong  recurrent  bleeding  episodes  into  joints,  muscles,  and 
closed  spaces,  either  spontaneously  or  following  an  injury.  The  most 
common  inherited  factor  deficiencies  are  the  hemophilias,  X-linked 
diseases caused by deficiency of factor (F) VIII (hemophilia A) or FIX

(hemophilia B). Rare congenital bleeding disorders due to deficiencies 
of other factors, including FII (prothrombin), FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, 
and  fibrinogen,  are  commonly  inherited  in  an  autosomal  recessive 
manner  (Table  116-1).  Disease  phenotype  often  correlates  with  the 
level of factor activity. While patients can have a congenital deficiency 
of FXII accompanied by a significant prolongation in the activated par-
tial thromboplastin time (aPTT), FXII deficiency is not accompanied 
by  a  bleeding  phenotype,  likely  due  to  redundant  paths  to  activation 
of  the  intrinsic  pathway  of  the  coagulation  cascade,  including  direct 
activation of FXI by thrombin generated through the extrinsic pathway 
(Fig.  116-1).  Advances  in  characterization  of  the  molecular  basis  of 
clotting  factor  deficiencies  have  contributed  to  better  understanding 
of the disease phenotypes allowing the development of more targeted 
therapeutic approaches, including the use of small molecules, recom-
binant proteins, or cell- and gene-based therapies.

aPTT

The two most commonly used tests of hemostasis, the prothrombin 
time  (PT)  and  the  aPTT,  were  designed  to  perform  the  first  screen 
for  clotting  factor  deficiency  (Fig.  116-1).  An 
isolated prolonged PT suggests FVII deficiency, 
whereas  a  prolonged  aPTT  indicates  an  intrin-
sic  pathway  factor  deficiency,  most  commonly 
hemophilia  A  or  B  (FVIII  or  FIX,  respectively) 
or FXI deficiency (Fig. 116-1). The prolongation 
of both PT and aPTT suggests a deficiency of FV, 
FX,  FII,  or  fibrinogen  abnormalities.  A  mixing 
study,  in  which  the  addition  of  normal  pooled 
plasma  to  the  patient’s  plasma,  will  correct  a 
prolonged aPTT or PT due to a factor deficiency, 
and  is  the  next  step  in  determining  if  there  is 
a  coagulation  factor  deficiency.  If  the  clotting 
time  does  not  correct,  it  suggests  the  presence 
of an inhibitor, an antibody to a specific factor; 
however, a mixing study will also detect the pres-
ence  of  anticoagulants.  Many  labs  have  testing 
methods for detecting inhibitors that neutralize 
anticoagulants. If the mixing study corrects with 
normal  plasma,  individual  factor  activity  assays 
are  performed  to  determine  which  factor  is 
deficient.

Acquired  deficiencies  of  plasma  coagulation 
factors are more frequent than congenital disor-
ders; the most common disorders include hem-
orrhagic  diathesis  of  liver  disease,  disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), and vitamin K 
deficiency. In these disorders, blood coagulation 

Cross-linked

is  hampered  by  the  deficiency  of  more  than  one  clotting  factor,  and 
the  bleeding  episodes  are  the  result  of  perturbation  of  both  primary 
(e.g., platelet and vessel wall interactions) and secondary (coagulation) 
hemostasis.

The development of alloantibodies to coagulation plasma proteins, 
clinically termed inhibitors, is a relatively rare disease that often affects 
hemophilia A or B and FXI-deficient patients on repetitive exposure to 
the missing protein to control bleeding episodes. Inhibitory autoanti-
bodies also occur among subjects without genetic deficiency of clotting 
factors  and  although  rare  can  be  seen  in  the  postpartum  setting,  as 
a  manifestation  of  underlying  autoimmune  or  neoplastic  disease,  or 
idiopathically.  Rare  cases  of  acquired  inhibitors  to  thrombin  or  FV 
have been reported in patients receiving topical bovine thrombin prep-
aration  as  a  local  hemostatic  agent  in  complex  surgeries.  The  results 
of  a  mixing  study  that  does  not  correct  with  the  addition  of  normal 
plasma indicate the presence of an inhibitor, requiring additional tests 
to identify the specificity of the inhibitor and measure its titer. Inhibitor

detection in patients with hemophilia is of particular importance, with 
yearly screening performed at most hemophilia treatment centers.

The  treatment  of  coagulation  factor  deficiencies  in  the  setting  of 
bleeding requires replacement of the deficient protein(s) using recom-
binant  or  purified  plasma-derived  products  or  fresh-frozen  plasma 
(FFP).  Prothrombin  complex  concentrates  (PCCs)  are  intermediate 
purity plasma-derived factor concentrates initially used as sources of 
FVIII or FIX for hemophilia patients, but as they contain the vitamin 
K-dependent factors, are also used for warfarin reversal. Three-factor PCC 
(3F-PCC)  is  less  frequently  used  now  for  warfarin  reversal  because 
these preparations contain low levels of FVII, requiring FFP as a source 
of  FVII.  Four-factor  PCC  (4F-PCC),  especially  the  one  used  in  the 
United States, contains FII, FIX, FX, higher levels of FVII than 3F-PCC, 
and protein S and protein C.

HEMOPHILIA A AND B
 ■ PATHOGENESIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive hemorrhagic disease due to muta-
tions in the F8 gene (hemophilia A or classic hemophilia) or F9 gene 
(hemophilia  B).  The  disease  affects  1  in  10,000  males  worldwide,  in 
all ethnic groups; hemophilia A represents 80% of all cases. The large 
size of the F8 gene makes it more susceptible to mutation events than 
the smaller F9 gene. Male subjects are clinically affected; women, who 
carry a single mutated gene, are generally asymptomatic. Family his-
tory of the disease is absent in ~30% of cases, and in these cases 80% 
of the mothers are carriers of the de novo mutated allele. More than 
500 different mutations have been identified in the F8 or  F9. One of 
the most common hemophilia A mutations results from an inversion 
of the intron 22 sequence, and it is present in 40% of cases of severe 
hemophilia  A.  Advances  in  molecular  diagnosis  now  permit  precise 
identification  of  mutations,  allowing  accurate  diagnosis  of  women 
carriers of the hemophilia gene in affected families.

Clinically,  hemophilia  A  and  hemophilia  B  are  indistinguishable. 
The disease phenotype correlates with the activity of FVIII or FIX and 
can be classified as severe (<1%), moderate (1–5%), or mild (6–30%).  
In  the  severe  and  moderate  forms,  the  disease  is  characterized  by 
bleeding into the joints (hemarthrosis), soft tissues, and muscles after 
minor trauma or even spontaneously. Patients with mild disease expe-
rience infrequent bleeding that is usually secondary to trauma. Among 
those with residual FVIII or FIX activity >25% of normal, the disease is 
discovered only in the event of bleeding after major trauma or during 
routine preoperative laboratory tests, usually with an isolated prolon-
gation  of  the  aPTT  that  requires  further  investigation  with  a  mixing 
study.  Factor  VIII  has  a  short  circulating  half-life  of  25–30  min  that 
is extended to roughly 12 h when complexed with its carrier protein 
von Willebrand factor (VWF). In patients without a known history of 
hemophilia,  a  diagnosis  of  von  Willebrand  disease  (VWD)  needs  to 
be excluded in patients with a prolonged aPTT and low FVIII activity. 
Early in life, bleeding may present after circumcision or rarely as intra-
cranial hemorrhages. The disease is more evident when children begin 
to walk or crawl. In the severe form, the most common bleeding man-
ifestations  are  recurrent  hemarthroses,  affecting  primarily  the  knees, 
elbows,  ankles,  shoulders,  and  hips.  Acute  hemarthroses  are  painful, 
and clinical signs are local swelling and erythema. To avoid pain, the 
patient may adopt a fixed position, which leads eventually to muscle 
contractures.  Very  young  children  unable  to  communicate  verbally 
show irritability and a lack of movement of the affected joint. Chronic 
hemarthroses are debilitating with synovial thickening and synovitis in 
response to the intraarticular blood. After a joint has been damaged, 
recurrent bleeding episodes result in the clinically recognized “target 
joint,” which then establishes a vicious cycle of bleeding, resulting in 
progressive joint deformity that in critical cases requires surgery as the 
only therapeutic option. Hematomas into the muscle of distal parts of 
the limbs may lead to external compression of arteries, veins, or nerves 
that can result in compartment syndrome.

Bleeding  into  the  oropharyngeal  spaces,  central  nervous  system 
(CNS), or retroperitoneum is life-threatening and requires immediate 
therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhages can accumulate large quantities 

of blood with formation of masses with calcification and inflammatory 
tissue reaction (pseudotumor syndrome) and also result in damage to 
the  femoral  nerve.  Pseudotumors  can  also  form  in  bones,  especially 
long  bones  of  the  lower  limbs.  Hematuria  is  frequent  among  hemo-
philia  patients,  even  in  the  absence  of  genitourinary  pathology.  It  is 
often self-limited and may not require specific therapy.

TREATMENT
Hemophilia

Without  treatment,  severe  hemophilia  may  limit  life  expectancy. 
Advances in the blood fractionation industry during World War II 
resulted in the realization that plasma could be used to treat hemo-
philia, but the volumes required to achieve even modest elevation 
of circulating factor levels limit the utility of plasma infusion as an 
approach to disease management. The discovery in the 1960s that 
the cryoprecipitate fraction of plasma was enriched for FVIII, and 
the eventual purification of FVIII and FIX from plasma, led to the 
introduction  of  home  infusion  therapy  with  factor  concentrates 
in  the  1970s.  The  availability  of  factor  concentrates  resulted  in  a 
dramatic improvement in life expectancy and in quality of life for 
people with severe hemophilia. However, the contamination of the 
blood supply with hepatitis viruses, and subsequently HIV, resulted 
in widespread transmission of these bloodborne infections within 
the  hemophilia  population.  The  introduction  of  viral  inactivation 
steps  in  the  preparation  of  plasma-derived  products  in  the  mid-
1980s greatly reduced the risk of HIV and hepatitis; the risks were 
further reduced by the production of recombinant FVIII and FIX 
proteins in the 1990s. It is uncommon for hemophilic patients born 
after 1985 to have contracted either hepatitis or HIV, and for these 
individuals,  life  expectancy  is  ∼65  years.  In  fact,  since  1998,  new 
infections  with  viral  hepatitis  or  HIV  have  not  been  reported  in 
hemophilia patients.

Factor  replacement  for  hemophilia  has  been  the  mainstay  of 
therapy  for  half  a  century;  however,  advances  including  uniquely 
functioning  molecules  and  gene  therapy  have  expanded  treat-
ment  approaches.  Factor  replacement  has  been  provided  either 
in  response  to  a  bleeding  episode  or  as  prophylactic  treatment. 
Primary prophylaxis is defined as maintaining the missing clotting 
factor at levels ~1% or higher on a regular basis in order to prevent 
bleeds,  especially  the  onset  of  hemarthroses.  Hemophilic  boys 
receiving regular infusions of FVIII (3 days/week) or FIX (2 days/
week)  can  reach  puberty  without  detectable  joint  abnormalities. 
Therefore, prophylactic treatment has become more common. The 
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  reported  that  more 
than 51% of children with severe hemophilia who are aged <6 years 
receive  prophylaxis,  increasing  considerably  from  33%  in  1995. 
Although  prophylaxis  with  factor  concentrates  is  the  standard 
care for children and adults with severe hemophilia, teenagers and 
young adults do not always maintain treatment due to high cost and 
lifestyle factors including difficulties accessing peripheral veins for 
two-to-three times a week infusions, and potential infectious and 
thrombotic risks of long-term central vein catheters.

Treatment  of  hemophilia  bleeds  requires  the  following:  (1) 
prompt initiation of factor replacement as symptoms often precede 
objective  evidence  of  bleeding,  especially  for  classic  symptoms  of 
bleeding  into  the  joint  in  a  reliable  patient,  headaches,  or  major 
trauma; and (2) avoidance of antiplatelet drugs.

FVIII  and  FIX  are  dosed  in  units.  One  unit  is  defined  as  the 
amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 μg/mL) in 1 mL of normal 
plasma. One unit of FVIII per kilogram of body weight increases 
the plasma FVIII level by 2%. One can calculate the dose needed to 
increase FVIII levels to 100% in a 70-kg severe hemophilia patient 
(<1%) using the simple formula below. Thus, 3500 units of FVIII 
will raise the circulating level to 100%.

FVIII dose (IU) = Target FVIII levels – FVIII baseline levels 

× body weight (kg) × 0.5 unit/kg

PART 4Oncology and HematologyThe  doses  for  FIX  replacement  are  different  from  those  for 
FVIII, because FIX recovery after infusion is usually only 50% of 
the predicted value. Therefore, the formula for FIX replacement is 
as follows:

FIX dose (IU) = Target FIX levels – FIX baseline levels 

× body weight (kg) × 1 unit/kg

The FVIII half-life of 8–12 h requires injections twice a day to 
maintain therapeutic levels, whereas the FIX half-life is longer, 
~24  h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient. In specific situa-
tions  such  as  after  surgery,  continuous  infusion  of  factor  may  be 
desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at 
a lower total cost.

Cryoprecipitate  is  enriched  with  FVIII  protein  bound  to  VWF 
(each bag contains ~80 IU of FVIII). Because of the risk of blood-
borne  diseases,  this  product  should  be  used  only  in  emergencies 
when factor concentrates are not available, although cryoprecipitate 
may be the only source of FVIII in developing countries.

Mild bleeds such as uncomplicated hemarthroses or superficial 
hematomas  require  achieving  an  initial  factor  level  of  30–50%. 
Additional doses to maintain levels of 15–25% for 2 or 3 days are 
indicated for severe hemarthroses, especially when these episodes 
affect  the  “target  joint.”  Large  hematomas,  or  bleeds  into  deep 
muscles, require factor levels of 50% or even higher if the clinical 
symptoms do not improve, and factor replacement may be required 
for  a  period  of  1  week  or  longer.  The  control  of  serious  bleeds, 
including those that affect the oropharyngeal spaces, CNS, and the 
retroperitoneum, requires sustained protein levels of 50–100% for 
7–10 days. Prophylactic replacement for surgery is aimed at achiev-
ing normal factor levels (100%) for a period of 7–10 days; replace-
ment can then be tapered depending on the extent of the surgical 
wounds.  Oral  surgery  is  associated  with  extensive  tissue  damage 
that usually requires factor replacement for 1–3 days coupled with 
oral antifibrinolytic drugs. 

NONTRANSFUSION THERAPY IN HEMOPHILIA 
DDAVP  (1-Amino-8-d-Arginine  Vasopressin)  DDAVP  is  a  syn-
thetic vasopressin analog that causes a transient rise in FVIII and 
VWF,  but  not  FIX  by  release  from  stores  in  vascular  endothelial 
cells. Patients with moderate or mild hemophilia A should be tested 
to  determine  if  they  respond  to  DDAVP  before  use.  DDAVP  at 
doses of 0.3 μg/kg body weight, over a 20-min period, is expected 
to  raise  FVIII  levels  by  two-  to  threefold  over  baseline,  peaking 
between 30 and 60 min after infusion. DDAVP does not improve 
FVIII levels in severe hemophilia A patients because no stores are 
available to release. Repeated dosing of DDAVP results in tachyphy-
laxis as storage pools are depleted. After three consecutive doses, if 
further therapy is indicated, exogenous FVIII is required. 

Antifibrinolytic  Drugs  Bleeding  in  the  gums,  in  the  gastroin-
testinal  tract,  and  during  oral  surgery  can  be  treated  with  oral 
antifibrinolytic  drugs  such  as  ε-amino  caproic  acid  (EACA)  or 
tranexamic  acid  to  prevent  fibrin  degradation  by  plasmin.  The 
duration  of  the  treatment  depending  on  the  clinical  indication  is   
1  week  or  longer.  Tranexamic  acid  is  given  at  doses  of  25  mg/kg 
three to four times a day. EACA treatment requires a loading dose 
of 200 mg/kg (maximum of 10 g) followed by 100 mg/kg per dose 
(maximum 30 g/d) every 6 h. These drugs are not indicated to con-
trol hematuria because of concern for forming an occlusive clot in 
the lumen of genitourinary tract structures. 

COMPLICATIONS 
Inhibitor Formation  The formation of alloantibodies to FVIII or FIX 
is the major complication of hemophilia treatment. The prevalence of 
inhibitors  to  FVIII  is  estimated  to  be  ~30%  in  severe  hemophilia  A 
patients and 10% among patients with nonsevere hemophilia A. Inhib-
itors to FIX are detected in only 3–5% of all hemophilia B patients. The 
high-risk  group  for  inhibitor  formation  includes  severe  deficiency

(>80% of all cases of inhibitors), familial history of inhibitor, African 
descent,  mutations  in  the  FVIII  or  FIX  gene  resulting  in  deletion 
of  large  coding  regions,  or  gross  gene  rearrangements.  Inhibitors 
usually appear early in life, at a median of 2 years of age, and after 
10  cumulative  days  of  exposure.  However,  intensive  replacement 
therapy such as for major surgery, intracranial bleeding, or trauma 
increases the risk of inhibitor formation for patients of all ages and 
degree of clinical severity, such that patients require close laboratory 
monitoring in the weeks following these events.

The clinical diagnosis of an inhibitor is suspected when patients 
do not respond to factor replacement at therapeutic doses. Inhibi-
tors increase both morbidity and mortality in hemophilia. Because 
early detection of an inhibitor is critical to a successful correction of 
the bleeding or to eradication of the antibody, most hemophilia cen-
ters perform annual screening with aPTT and mixing studies. The 
Bethesda assay uses a similar principle as a mixing study and defines 
the specificity of the inhibitor and its titer. The results are expressed 
in Bethesda units (BU), in which 1 BU is the amount of antibody 
that neutralizes 50% of the FVIII or FIX present in normal plasma 
after 2 h of incubation at 37°C. Clinically, inhibitor patients are clas-
sified as low responders or high responders, with response defined 
as increase in antibody titer; knowledge of responder type guides 
therapy.  Therapy  for  inhibitor  patients  has  two  goals:  the  control 
of acute bleeding episodes and the eradication of the inhibitor. For 
the  control  of  bleeding  episodes,  low  responders,  those  with  titer 
<5 BU, respond well to high doses of human FVIII (50–100 U/kg),  
with  minimal  or  no  increase  in  the  inhibitor  titers.  However, 
high-responder patients, those with initial inhibitor titer >5 BU or 
an anamnestic response with increase in the antibody titer to >5 BU,  
even  if  low  titer  initially,  do  not  respond  to  FVIII.  The  control 
of  bleeding  episodes  in  high-responder  patients  can  be  achieved 
by  using  concentrates  enriched  for  prothrombin,  FVII,  FIX,  FX 
(prothrombin  complex  concentrates  [PCCs]  but  usually  activated 
PCCs  [aPCCs]),  and  recombinant  activated  factor  VII  (FVIIa) 
known  as  “bypass  agents”  as  they  activate  coagulation  down-
stream of the inhibited/absent factor or through a different pathway  
(Fig. 116-1). For FIX inhibitor patients, high doses of FIX can be used 
(<5 BU); however, allergic or anaphylactic reactions are common in 
FIX inhibitor patients; thus bypass products should be used to treat or 
prevent bleeding as well as for those cases of high titer inhibitors. For 
eradication of the inhibitory antibody, immunosuppression alone is 
not effective. The most effective strategy is immune tolerance induc-
tion  (ITI)  based  on  daily  infusion  of  the  missing  protein  until  the 
inhibitor disappears, typically requiring periods >1 year, with success 
rates of ∼60%. The management of patients with severe hemophilia 
and inhibitors resistant to ITI is challenging. The use of anti-CD20 
monoclonal  antibody  (rituximab)  combined  with  ITI  was  thought 
to be effective but while it reduces the inhibitor titers in some cases, 
sustained eradication is uncommon. 

Other  Therapeutic  Approaches  for  Hemophilia  A  and  B  Engi-
neered clotting factors, using fusion to polyethylene glycol (FVIII, 
FIX), IgG1-Fc (FVIII, FIX) or albumin (FIX) with resultant longer 
half-lives, have been in development, with one currently approved 
for  use.  These  new-generation  products  (for  FVIII  and  FIX)  aim 
to  facilitate  prophylaxis  by  requiring  fewer  weekly  injections  to 
maintain circulating levels >1%, with infusion frequency decreas-
ing  from  3  to  2  days  a  week  in  hemophilia  A,  and  notably  for 
hemophilia B, only once-a-week injections of long-acting FIX are 
required. Other novel approaches to manipulating the coagulation 
cascade  components,  such  as  targeting  the  natural  anticoagulants 
and inhibitors of activation of coagulation, are in development.

Emicizumab  is  an  asymmetric  bispecific  antibody  with  one 
immunoglobulin variable chain region that binds FIXa and another 
that  binds  FX  bringing  them  in  close  contact  resulting  in  acti-
vation  of  FX  by  FIXa.  FXa  subsequently  cleaves  prothrombin  to 
thrombin—without the need for FVIII (Fig. 116-2). It is effective 
in  patients  with  severe  hemophilia  A  with  or  without  inhibitors. 
After initial once-a-week subcutaneous injections (an improvement

FIGURE 116-2  Mechanism of action of emicizumab. Emicizumab is a bifunctional 
antibody; the two binding sites recognize different protein sequences, unlike normal 
antibodies  where  both  variable  regions  recognize  the  same  antigen.  One  arm  of 
emicizumab recognizes factor IXa and the other factor X. It functions to bring these 
two factors in proximity so that factor IXa can activate factor X to factor Xa, which 
then cleaves prothrombin to thrombin and activates the clotting cascade. (From T

over intravenous administration of factors) for 4 weeks, patients can 
be maintained with once-a-month dosing to prevent spontaneous 
bleeds,  an  overwhelmingly  dramatic  improvement  in  quality  of 
life when compared to even the twice-weekly infusion schedule of 
“long-acting”  FVIII  compounds.  Breakthrough  bleeds  can  occur, 
however, and need to be carefully managed, as a small number of 
patients  with  inhibitors  treated  with  aPCC  or  recombinant  FVIIa 
developed thrombotic events or fatal thrombotic microangiopathy.
These X-linked disorders are ideally suited for gene therapy as 
small increases in plasma factor level will result in significant clinical 
improvement. FIX has been the most studied as the gene is smaller 
and easier to package in the viral vectors used. In one approach, the 
sequence of a known spontaneous FIX gain of function mutation 
that has marked increase in specific activity, FIX Padua, is used so 
that small increments in plasma level of FIX are also accompanied 
by even greater increase in functional activity. The larger FVIII gene 
has also been successfully transferred through an adeno-associated 
viral vector to a few patients with hemophilia A. The early results 
appear promising. Complications include transaminitis and loss of 
gene expression for a variety of reasons; no gene therapy approaches 
have regulatory approval yet (Chap. 470). 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Hemophilia patients treated with clotting factor concentrates before 
the development of recombinant factors in the 1990s were almost 
universally infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. These 
infections are the major cause of morbidity and the second leading 
cause  of  death  in  these  patients.  Co-infection  of  HCV  and  HIV, 
present  in  almost  50%  of  hemophilia  patients,  is  an  aggravating 
factor for the evolution of liver disease as correction of both genetic 
and  acquired  (secondary  to  liver  disease)  factor  deficiencies  may 
be  needed.  Improvements  in  treatment  of  both  HIV  and  HCV 
have altered the devastating prognosis for many infected patients. 

In  some  select  cases  with  cirrhosis,  liver  transplant  has  been  per-
formed, which also is curative for hemophilia. 
EMERGING CLINICAL PROBLEMS IN AGING  
HEMOPHILIA PATIENTS
The number of patients living with hemophilia well into adulthood 
has increased with the advances in treatments. The life expectancy 
of  patients  with  severe  hemophilia  is  now  only  ~10  years  shorter 
than the general male population, and near normal in patients with 
mild or moderate hemophilia. The older hemophilia population has 
distinct  needs  relating  to  more  severe  arthropathy,  chronic  pain, 
and high rates of HCV and/or HIV infections.

Although  mortality  from  coronary  artery  disease  is  lower  in 
hemophilia  patients  with  hypocoagulability  decreasing  thrombus 
formation,  atherogenesis  is  not  prevented.  Typical  cardiovascular 
risk  factors  such  as  age,  obesity,  and  smoking,  along  with  physi-
cal  inactivity,  hypertension,  and  chronic  renal  disease  are  seen  in 
hemophilia patients as in the general population.

Management  of  an  acute  ischemic  event  and  coronary  revas-
cularization  should  include  collaboration  among  hematologists, 
cardiologists, and internists. Cancer due to HIV- and HCV-related 
malignancies  is  also  a  concern  in  this  population,  with  hepatoc-
ellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  the  most  common  cause  of  death  in 
HIV-negative  patients.  The  recommendations  for  cancer  screening 
for  the  general  population  should  be  the  same  for  age-matched 
hemophilia  patients,  including  routine  screening  for  HCC.  Screen-
ing  for  GU  or  GI  tract  neoplasms  in  patients  with  hematuria  or 
hematochezia may be delayed. Hemophilia patients benefit from the 
same preventive and therapeutic approaches to minimize the risk of 
cardiovascular disease and malignancy as the general population. 
MANAGEMENT OF CARRIERS OF HEMOPHILIA
Women carriers of hemophilia with factor levels ~50% of normal 
may not have an increased risk for bleeding. However, a wide range 
of  factor  activity  (22–116%)  due  to  random  inactivation  of  the  X 
chromosome (lyonization) can occur and lead to unexpected bleed-
ing  in  women  with  low  levels.  The  factor  level  of  carriers  should 
be measured to optimize perioperative management. During preg-
nancy, FVIII levels increase approximately two- to threefold com-
pared  to  nonpregnant  women,  whereas  the  FIX  increase  is  less 
pronounced. After delivery, a rapid fall in the pregnancy-induced 
rise of maternal clotting factor levels occurs resulting in an immi-
nent  risk  of  bleeding  that  can  be  prevented  by  infusion  of  factor 
concentrate to levels of 50–70% for 3 days for vaginal delivery and 
up to 5 days for cesarean delivery. In mild cases, the use of DDAVP 
and/or antifibrinolytic drugs is recommended.

 ■ FACTOR XI DEFICIENCY
Factor XI deficiency, also known as hemophilia C, is a rare autosomal 
bleeding disorder that occurs at a frequency of one in a million. How-
ever, the disease is highly prevalent among Ashkenazi and Iraqi Jewish 
populations, reaching a frequency of 6% heterozygotes and 0.1–0.3% 
homozygotes.  More  than  65  mutations  in  the  FXI  gene  have  been 
reported,  whereas  fewer  mutations  (two  to  three)  are  found  among 
affected Jewish populations.

Normal FXI clotting activity levels range from 70–150 U/dL. Levels 
vary depending on the presence of heterozygous, homozygous, or dou-
ble heterozygous mutations with levels <1 U/dL seen in the latter two. 
Patients with FXI levels <10% of normal have a high risk of bleeding, 
but the phenotype does not always correlate with FXI clotting activity. 
The  family  history  is  informative,  with  the  bleeding  risk  based  on 
bleeding  in  kindreds.  Clinically,  mucocutaneous  hemorrhages  such 
as  bruises,  gum  bleeding,  epistaxis,  hematuria,  and  menorrhagia  are 
common,  especially  following  trauma.  This  hemorrhagic  phenotype 
suggests  that  tissues  rich  in  fibrinolytic  activity  are  more  susceptible 
to  FXI  deficiency.  Postoperative  bleeding  is  common  but  not  always 
present, even among patients with very low FXI levels.

FXI  replacement  is  indicated  in  patients  with  severe  disease  for 
major surgical procedures. A negative history of bleeding complications

following  invasive  procedures  does  not  exclude  the  possibility  of  an 
increased risk for hemorrhage.

TREATMENT
Factor XI Deficiency

Sources  of  FXI  are  limited  to  FFP  in  the  United  States,  while  a 
plasma-derived FXI concentrate is available in other countries. FFP 
at  doses  of  15–20  mL/kg  to  maintain  trough  levels  ranging  from 
10–20% can be given every other day in the setting of bleeding or 
major surgery as FXI has a half-life of 40–70 h. Antifibrinolytic drugs 
can be used for minor bleeds and as adjunctive treatment with FXI 
replacement with the exception of GU tract bleeding. The develop-
ment of an FXI inhibitor can be seen in 10% of severely FXI-deficient 
patients.  Although  inhibitors  are  not  associated  with  spontaneous 
bleeding, bleeding with surgery or trauma can be severe; treatment 
with PCC/aPCC or recombinant activated FVII is effective.

RARE BLEEDING DISORDERS
Inherited disorders resulting from deficiencies of clotting factors other 
than  FVIII,  FIX,  and  FXI  (Table  116-1)  occur  infrequently.  Bleeding 
manifestations  vary  from  generally  asymptomatic  as  with  dysfibrin-
ogenemia  or  FVII  deficiency  to  life-threatening  as  with  FX  or  FXIII 
deficiency. In contrast to hemophilia, hemarthroses are rare but bleed-
ing in the mucosal tract or after umbilical cord clamping is common. 
Individuals heterozygous for plasma coagulation deficiencies are often 
asymptomatic.  The  laboratory  assessment  for  the  specific  deficient 
factor following screening with general coagulation tests (Table 116-1) 
identifies the diagnosis.

Replacement therapy using FFP or PCCs for deficiencies provides 
adequate  hemostasis  for  bleeds  or  prophylactic  treatment,  although 
specific concentrates for FX and fibrinogen are available. Cryoprecip-
itate  or  FXIII  concentrate  is  needed  for  FXIII  deficiency.  FVII  defi-
ciency, like FXI, has an increased prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish 
population  and  is  best  treated  with  rVIIa  rather  than  FFP  or  PCCs 
depending on the severity of bleeding or type of surgery.

 ■ FAMILIAL MULTIPLE COAGULATION 
DEFICIENCIES
Several bleeding disorders are characterized by the inherited deficiency 
of more than one plasma coagulation factor. To date, the genetic defects 
in two of these diseases have been characterized, and they provide new 
insights  into  the  regulation  of  hemostasis  by  gene-encoding  proteins 
outside blood coagulation.

Combined  Deficiency  of  FV  and  FVIII  Patients  with  com-
bined FV and FVIII deficiency exhibit ~5% of residual clotting activ-
ity  of  each  factor,  yet  it  is  associated  with  a  mild  bleeding  tendency, 
often  following  trauma.  A  mutation  in  the  lectin  mannose  binding 
1  (LMAN1)  gene,  a  mannose-binding  protein  localized  in  the  Golgi 
apparatus  that  functions  as  a  chaperone  for  both  FV  and  FVIII,  is 
responsible.  In  other  families,  mutations  in  the  multiple  coagulation 
factor deficiency 2 (MCFD2) gene have been defined; this gene encodes 
a protein that forms a Ca2+ dependent complex with LMAN1 and pro-
vides cofactor activity in the intracellular mobilization of both FV and 
FVIII. Replacement therapy to control or prevent bleeding consists of 
FFP to maintain FV levels and DDAVP or FVIII concentrate to achieve 
FVIII levels of 20–40%. Alternatively, platelets, which contain FV, can 
also be used.

Multiple Deficiencies of Vitamin K–Dependent Coagulation 
Factors  Two  enzymes  involved  in  vitamin  K  metabolism  have 
been associated with combined deficiency of all vitamin K–dependent 
proteins,  including  the  procoagulant  proteins  prothrombin  (II),  VII, 
IX, and X and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is a fat- 
soluble vitamin that is a cofactor for carboxylation of the gamma car-
bon of the glutamic acid residues in the vitamin K–dependent factors, 
a critical step for calcium and phospholipid binding of these proteins

FIGURE  116-3  The  vitamin  K  cycle.  Vitamin  K  is  a  cofactor  for  the  formation  of 
γ-carboxyglutamic  acid  residues  on  coagulation  proteins.  Vitamin  K–dependent 
γ-glutamylcarboxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the vitamin K epoxide reductase, 
regenerates  reduced  vitamin  K.  Warfarin  blocks  the  action  of  the  reductase  and 
competitively inhibits the effects of vitamin K.

(Fig. 116-3). The enzymes γ-glutamylcarboxylase and epoxide reduc-
tase are critical for the metabolism and regeneration of vitamin K. Muta-
tions in the genes encoding the γ-carboxylase (GGCX) or vitamin K  
epoxide  reductase  complex  1  (VKORC1)  result  in  defective  enzymes 
and thus in vitamin K–dependent factors with reduced activity, vary-
ing from 1–30% of normal. Patients can have mild to severe bleeding 
episodes present from birth. Some patients respond to oral vitamin K1  
(5–20 mg/d), or parenteral vitamin K1 at doses of 5–20 mg/week. For 
severe bleeding, replacement therapy with PCC may be necessary.

 ■ DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION
In  2001,  the  International  Society  on  Thrombosis  and  Haemostatis 
(ISTH)  defined  disseminated  intravascular  congestion  (DIC)  as  “an 
acquired  syndrome  characterized  by  the  intravascular  activation  of 
coagulation with loss of localization arising from different causes that 
can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which 
if sufficiently severe, can produce organ dysfunction.” Many disparate 
processes are associated with DIC (Table 116-2).

The  most  common  causes  are  bacterial  sepsis,  although  viral  and 
fungal  sepsis  can  also  cause  DIC,  trauma,  obstetric  causes  such  as 
abruptio placentae or amniotic fluid embolism, and malignant disor-
ders especially mucin-producing adenocarcinomas and acute promy-
elocytic  leukemia.  Activation  of  inflammatory  pathways  in  response 
to infectious pathogens results in increased expression of tissue factor, 
activation of neutrophils and monocytes with release of cytokines and 
development of neutrophil extracellular traps, and release of polyphos-
phates that engage in cross talk with the coagulation system to cause 
thrombin generation; this process is known as thrombo-inflammation. 
Damage to vascular endothelial cells results in the loss of their native 
antithrombotic  properties;  such  damage  especially  occurs  with  sep-
sis  and  trauma.  Systemic  inflammatory  response  syndrome  (SIRS) 
and  cytokine  storm  are  cytokine-mediated  exuberant  inflammatory 
responses  often  in  the  setting  of  infection  that  are  associated  with 
increased  mortality  and  DIC.  Purpura  fulminans  is  a  severe  form  of 
DIC  resulting  in  thrombosis  of  extensive  areas  of  the  skin;  it  affects 
predominantly  young  children  following  viral  or  bacterial  infection, 
particularly  those  with  inherited  or  acquired  hypercoagulability  due 
to deficiencies of the components of the protein C pathway. Neonates 
homozygous  for  protein  C  deficiency  can  develop  neonatal  purpura 
fulminans with or without thrombosis of large vessels.

The  central  mechanism  of  DIC  is  the  uncontrolled  generation 
of  thrombin  by  multiple  mechanisms  (Fig.  116-4).  Simultaneous 
disruption  of  the  physiologic  anticoagulant  mechanisms  and  abnor-
mal  fibrinolysis  further  accelerate  the  process.  These  abnormalities 
contribute to systemic fibrin deposition in small and midsize vessels. 
The  duration  and  intensity  of  the  fibrin  deposition  can  compromise

the  blood  supply  of  many  organs,  especially  the  lung,  kidney,  liver, 
and  brain,  with  consequent  organ  failure;  for  example,  pulmonary 
microvascular thrombosis is a component of adult respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS). The sustained activation of coagulation and forma-
tion of fibrin can result in consumption of clotting factors and platelets, 

which  in  turn  leads  to  systemic  bleeding  that  can  be  aggravated  by 
secondary hyperfibrinolysis that occurs in late stages of DIC.

Clinical  manifestations  of  DIC  are  related  to  the  magnitude  of 
the  imbalance  of  hemostasis,  to  the  underlying  disease,  or  to  both. 
The  most  common  clinical  findings  include  petechiae,  ecchymoses, 
and  bleeding  ranging  from  oozing  from  venipuncture  sites  to  severe 
hemorrhage from the gastrointestinal tract, lung, or into the CNS. In 
chronic DIC, the bleeding symptoms are discrete and restricted to skin 
or  mucosal  surfaces.  The  hypercoagulability  of  DIC  manifests  as  the 
occlusion of vessels in the microcirculation and resulting organ failure. 
Thrombosis  of  large  vessels  and  cerebral  embolism  can  also  occur. 
Hemodynamic complications and shock are common among patients 
with acute DIC, due to the underlying disease, with mortality ranging 
from 30 to >80%.

Making the diagnosis of DIC can be difficult. The ISTH has devel-
oped a validated scoring tool to aid in the diagnosis of overt DIC with a 
separate tool for pregnant women. It incorporates platelet count, d-dimer 
level, prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen level, and assigns points 
for  different  levels  of  each  with  the  aggregate  score  helping  to  make 
the diagnosis of DIC (Table 116-3). The peripheral smear should be 
assessed  for  schistocytes.  The  laboratory  diagnosis  of  DIC  should 
prompt a search for the underlying disease if not already apparent. In 
critically ill patients, these tests should be repeated over a period of 6–8 h 
as patients can rapidly deteriorate.
Chronic DIC  Low-grade, compensated DIC can occur in clinical 
situations  including  giant  hemangioma,  metastatic  carcinoma,  or  the 
dead fetus syndrome. Plasma levels of FDP or d-dimers are elevated. 
aPTT, PT, and fibrinogen values are within the normal range or high. 
Mild  thrombocytopenia  or  normal  platelet  counts  are  also  common 
findings. Red cell fragmentation is often detected but at a lower degree 
than in acute DIC.

Differential  Diagnosis  Distinguishing  between  DIC  and  severe 
liver disease is challenging and requires serial measurements of the lab-
oratory parameters of DIC. Patients with severe liver disease manifest 
laboratory features including thrombocytopenia due to platelet seques-
tration, portal hypertension, or hypersplenism; decreased synthesis of 
coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants; and elevated levels of 
d-dimer. However, in contrast to DIC, these laboratory parameters in 
liver disease do not change rapidly.

thrombocytopenia,  red  cell  fragmentation,  and  multiorgan  failure,  the 
clinical  presentation  and  laboratory  findings  such  as  an  inhibitor  to 
ADAMTS13  levels  assist  in  making  the  microangiopathic  disorder 
diagnosis (Chap. 115).

TREATMENT
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

The  morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with  DIC  are  primarily 
related  to  the  underlying  disease.  Management  of  the  underlying 
disease is required to control and eliminate DIC; however, support 
with platelets and coagulation factors may be needed until the inciting 
cause is under control. Many patients with overt DIC are critically 
ill, usually requiring management in the intensive care unit to treat 
shock physiology and other manifestations of the underlying illness. 

MANAGEMENT OF HEMORRHAGIC SYMPTOMS
Patients with active bleeding or at high risk of bleeding during inva-
sive procedures or after chemotherapy require transfusion support; 
however, transfusion solely to correct mildly to moderately abnor-
mal coagulation parameters is not indicated. Platelet transfusion for 
platelet  counts  <10,000–20,000/μL  and  replacement  of  fibrinogen 
and coagulation factors with FFP, with cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen 
concentrate as a source of fibrinogen, are indicated with amounts 
determined  by  the  degree  of  abnormal  PT,  aPTT,  and  fibrinogen 
levels, as well as severity of bleeding or bleeding risk with invasive 
procedures. For these situations, fibrinogen level should be main-
tained at >150 mg/dL and PT prolonged no more than 3 s above the 
upper limit of normal. Vitamin K should be given. Patients should 
be  frequently  monitored,  and  transfusion  support  adjusted  as  the 
patient’s condition changes and dictates. 

REPLACEMENT OF COAGULATION OR  
FIBRINOLYSIS INHIBITORS
Anticoagulants  such  as  heparin,  antithrombin  III  (ATIII),  and 
thrombomodulin  concentrates,  and  antifibrinolytic  drugs  have  all 
been  tried  in  the  treatment  of  DIC.  Low  doses  of  continuous- 
infusion heparin (5–10 U/kg per h) may be effective in patients with 
low-grade  DIC  associated  with  solid  tumors,  acute  promyelocytic 
leukemia,  or  in  a  setting  with  recognized  thrombosis.  Heparin  is 
also indicated for the treatment of purpura fulminans, during the 
surgical resection of giant hemangiomas, and during removal of a 
dead fetus. In acute hemorrhagic DIC, the use of heparin is likely to 
aggravate bleeding. The use of heparin in patients with severe DIC, 
although demonstrating improved coagulation parameters, has not

had  a  survival  benefit;  professional  society  recommendations  for 
use  vary  widely.  Although  the  use  of  concentrates  of  the  serine 
protease inhibitors, antithrombin and thrombomodulin, for sepsis 
demonstrated little efficacy in all treated patients, post hoc analyses 
of those with sepsis and confirmed DIC suggest a survival advan-
tage  and  require  further  study.  Activated  protein  C  treatment  for 
septic shock was withdrawn from the market years ago as findings 
in clinical practice did not replicate the mortality advantage seen in 
the clinical trial; impact on DIC was not evaluated.

In  patients  who  have  DIC  characterized  by  a  primary  hyper-
fibrinolytic  state  with  concomitant  severe  bleeding,  the  adminis-
tration  of  antifibrinolytics  may  be  considered.  However,  concern 
for  increasing  the  risk  of  thrombosis  has  led  to  consideration  of 
concomitant use of heparin. Patients with acute promyelocytic leu-
kemia or those with chronic DIC associated with giant hemangio-
mas are among the few patients who may benefit from this therapy.

 ■ VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY
Vitamin K–dependent proteins are a heterogeneous group, including 
clotting factor proteins and also proteins found in bone, lung, kidney, 
and  placenta.  Vitamin  K  mediates  posttranslational  modification 
of  glutamate  residues  to  γ-carboxylglutamate,  a  critical  step  for  the 
activity  of  vitamin  K–dependent  proteins  for  calcium  binding  and 
proper  assembly  on  phospholipid  membranes  (Fig.  116-3).  Inherited 
mutations  with  decreased  functional  activity  of  the  enzymes  GGCX 
or VKORC1 (see above) result in bleeding disorders. Vitamin K in the 
diet is often limiting for the carboxylation reaction; thus recycling of 
the vitamin K by these enzymes is essential to maintain normal levels of 
vitamin K–dependent proteins. In adults, severe vitamin K deficiency 
due to low dietary intake in adults is rare but is common in association 
with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, or with disease or surgical 
interventions that affect the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb vita-
min K, through anatomic alterations or by changing the fat content of 
bile salts and pancreatic enzymes in the proximal small bowel. Chronic 
liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis also deplete vitamin K stores. 
Neonatal vitamin K deficiency and the resulting hemorrhagic disease 
of the newborn have been almost entirely eliminated by routine admin-
istration of vitamin K to all neonates. Prolongation of PT values is the 
most common and earliest finding in vitamin K–deficient patients due 
to  the  short  half-life  of  FVII,  and  occurs  before  prolongation  of  the 
aPTT.  Parenteral  administration  of  10  mg  of  vitamin  K  is  sufficient 
to  restore  normal  levels  of  clotting  factor  within  8–10  h.  More  rapid 
correction of the coagulopathy requires replacement with FFP or PCC, 
the choice depending on patient intravascular volume status and need 
for rapidity of correction. The reversal of excessive anticoagulant ther-
apy with vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, can be achieved by 
minimal doses of vitamin K (1 mg orally or by intravenous injection) 
for asymptomatic patients. This strategy can diminish the risk of bleed-
ing  while  maintaining  therapeutic  anticoagulation  for  an  underlying 
prothrombotic state. For emergent reversal of warfarin in the setting of 
life-threatening bleeding or need for emergency surgery, use of 4F-PPC 
is the standard of care.

In patients with underlying vascular disease, vascular trauma, atrial 
fibrillation,  and  other  comorbidities,  re-initiation  of  anticoagulation 
needs  to  be  carefully  considered  to  prevent  subsequent  thromboem-
bolic complications.
 ■ COAGULATION DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH 
LIVER FAILURE
The  liver  is  the  site  of  synthesis  and  clearance  of  most  procoagulant 
and  natural  anticoagulant  proteins  and  of  essential  components  of 
the  fibrinolytic  system.  Liver  failure  is  associated  with  a  high  risk 
of  bleeding  due  to  deficient  synthesis  of  procoagulant  factors  and 
enhanced  fibrinolysis;  hepatologists  refer  to  this  as  accelerated  intra-
vascular  coagulation  and  fibrinolysis  (AICF).  Thrombocytopenia  is 
common  in  patients  with  liver  disease  and  may  be  due  to  decreased 
thrombopoietin that is synthesized in the liver, congestive splenomeg-
aly (hypersplenism), or immune-mediated shortened platelet life span

(primary  biliary  cirrhosis).  In  addition,  several  anatomic  abnormali-
ties secondary to underlying liver disease further increase the risk of 
bleeding  (Table  116-4).  Dysfibrinogenemia  is  a  relatively  common 
finding in patients with liver disease due to impaired fibrin polymer-
ization. The development of DIC in patients with chronic liver disease 
is not uncommon and may enhance the risk for bleeding. Laboratory 
evaluation  is  mandatory  for  an  optimal  therapeutic  strategy,  either 
to  control  ongoing  bleeding  or  before  invasive  procedures.  Typically, 
these  patients  present  with  prolonged  PT,  aPTT,  and  TT  depending 
on  the  degree  of  liver  damage,  thrombocytopenia,  and  normal  or 
slight increase in d-dimer. Fibrinogen levels are low only in fulminant 
hepatitis,  decompensated  cirrhosis,  advanced  liver  disease,  or  in  the 
presence of DIC. The presence of prolonged 
TT and normal fibrinogen and d-dimer lev-
els suggests dysfibrinogenemia. FVIII levels 
are often normal or elevated in patients with 
liver  failure,  and  decreased  levels  suggest 
superimposed  DIC.  FV  is  only  synthesized 
in  the  hepatocyte  and  is  not  a  vitamin  K–
dependent protein; therefore, reduced levels 
of  FV  may  be  an  indicator  of  liver  failure. 
Normal levels of FV and low levels of FVII 
suggest  vitamin  K  deficiency.  Vitamin  K 
levels may be reduced in patients with liver 
failure due to compromised storage in hepa-
tocellular  disease,  changes  in  bile  acids,  or 
cholestasis that can diminish the absorption 
of vitamin K. Replacement with IV vitamin 
K may improve hemostasis.

or immediately before an invasive procedure if counts are <50,000/μL. 
Cryoprecipitate is indicated only when fibrinogen levels are <100–150 
mg/mL unless the patient is bleeding in which case a higher target is 
used. The use of antifibrinolytic drugs as adjuncts to control bleeding 
in patients with liver failure is not thought to result in an increased risk 
of thrombosis; however, their impact on acute thrombosis propagation 
is not well studied.

Liver  Disease  and  Thromboembolism  Bleeding  in  patients 
with stable liver disease is often mild or even asymptomatic. However, 
as  the  disease  progresses,  the  hemostatic  balance  is  precarious  and 
easily disturbed; comorbid complications such as infections and renal 
failure  can  rapidly  upset  this  balance  (Fig.  116-5).  Past  assumptions 
based  on  abnormal  coagulation  tests  have  been  that  patients  with 
liver  disease  have  a  decreased  risk  of  thrombosis;  however,  multiple 
factors  contribute  to  hypercoagulability,  including  decreased  levels 
of  the  natural  anticoagulant  proteins  S  and  C,  as  well  as  endothelial 
cell changes and hemodynamic changes that result in stasis such that 
portal vein thrombosis is common. Patients with liver disease can also 
develop  deep-vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism;  those  with 
cirrhosis appear to have a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the rate of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE). Patients with compensated cirrhosis do not 
appear to have increased bleeding with the use of VTE prophylaxis or 
even  therapeutic  dose  heparin  to  treat  acute  portal  vein  thrombosis 
when carefully managed. In the outpatient setting, warfarin is avoided 
but low-molecular-weight heparin and direct oral anticoagulants have 
been safely used to treat thrombosis.

Acquired  Inhibitors  of  Coagulation  Factors  An  acquired 
inhibitor  is  an  immune-mediated  disease  characterized  by  the  pres-
ence of an autoantibody against a specific clotting factor. Almost half 
of  patients  with  an  acquired  factor  inhibitor  will  have  an  underlying 
autoimmune or immunoproliferative disorder, malignancy, or be peri-
partum. FVIII is the most common target of antibody formation and 
is  sometimes  referred  to  as  acquired  hemophilia  A,  but  inhibitors  to 
prothrombin (FII), FV, FIX, FX, and FXI are also reported. Acquired 
inhibitor to FVIII occurs predominantly in older adults (median age 
of 60 years) but occasionally in pregnant or postpartum women with 
no previous history of bleeding. Bleeding episodes occur commonly in

Although  treatment  of  bleeding  with 
FFP  was  the  standard  approach  to  cor-
recting  hemostasis  in  patients  with  liver 
failure,  the  use  of  4F-PCC  is  now  favored 
due to lower volume, less increase in portal 
pressure,  reduced  risk  of  circulatory  over-
load,  and  other  complications  associated 
with  FFP  transfusion.  As  in  any  clinical 
situation,  treatment  should  not  be  given 
simply  to  correct  laboratory  abnormalities 
in a patient who is not bleeding or with no 
need  for  invasive  procedures.  Platelet  con-
centrates are indicated when platelet counts 
are  <10,000–20,000/μL  to  control  bleeding

to hemophilia, hemarthrosis is rare in these patients. Retroperitoneal 
hemorrhages and other life-threatening bleeding may appear suddenly. 
The  overall  mortality  in  untreated  patients  ranges  from  8–22%,  and 
most  deaths  occur  within  the  first  few  weeks  after  presentation.  The 
diagnosis is based on the prolonged aPTT with normal PT and TT and 
a mixing study that does not correct with normal pooled plasma. The 
Bethesda assay using factor specific-deficient plasma as performed for 
inhibitor  detection  in  hemophilia  will  confirm  the  diagnosis.  Treat-
ment  of  acquired  inhibitors  of  coagulation  factors  requires  control 
of  bleeding  and  eradication  of  the  inhibitor.  Many  patients  can  have 
life-threatening bleeding. The use of activated “bypass products” such 
as  aPCC  or  recombinant  FVIIa  is  required.  The  use  of  recombinant 
porcine FVIII can be effective for acquired inhibitors of FVIII. The use 
of emicizumab to treat acquired FVIII inhibitors has been reported and 
trials in this population are underway in Europe.

In contrast to hemophilia, inhibitors in nonhemophilic patients are 
typically  responsive  to  immune  suppression,  and  therapy  should  be 
initiated  early  for  most  cases.  High-dose  intravenous  γ-globulin  and 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody are reported to be effective in patients 
with autoantibodies to FVIII; however, no firm evidence confirms that 
these alternatives are superior to the first line of immunosuppressive 
drugs  (glucocorticoids  and  cyclophosphamide),  effective  in  70%  of 
patients. Relapse of an inhibitor to FVIII is relatively common (up to 
20%) within the first 6 months following withdrawal of immunosup-
pression; patients should be followed up regularly for relapse.

Topical plasma-derived bovine and human thrombin are commonly 
used  during  major  cardiovascular,  thoracic,  neurologic,  and  pelvic 
surgeries as well as in trauma patients with extensive burns. Antibody 
formation  to  the  xenoantigen  or  its  contaminant  (bovine  clotting 
protein) has the potential to cross-react with human clotting factors, 
particularly FV and thrombin and can result in bleeding that can be 
life-threatening. The development of antibodies to FV with the use of 
topical  preparations  of  recombinant  human  thrombin  has  also  been 
reported. The clinical diagnosis of these acquired coagulopathies is rare 
but is often complicated by the fact that the bleeding episodes may be 
detectable during or immediately following major surgery and could be 
assumed to be due to the procedure itself.

The  risk  of  developing  a  cross-reacting  antibody  is  increased  by 
repeated  exposure  to  topical  thrombin  preparations.  Thus,  a  careful 
medical  history  of  previous  surgical  interventions  that  may  have 
occurred even decades earlier is critical to assessing risk.

The  laboratory  abnormalities  include  a  combined  prolongation  of 
the  aPTT  and  PT  that  often  fails  to  improve  by  transfusion  of  FFP 
and vitamin K, and a mixing study that does not correct with normal 
pooled  plasma.  The  specificity  of  the  antibody  is  determined  by  the 
measurement of the residual activity of human FV or other suspected 
human clotting factor. No assays specific for bovine thrombin coagul-
opathy are commercially available.

No treatment guidelines have been established. Platelet transfusions 
have  been  used  as  a  source  of  FV  replacement  for  patients  with  FV 
inhibitors.  FFP  and  vitamin  K  supplementation  may  function  as  co- 
adjuvants rather than as effective treatments for the coagulopathy itself. 
Experience with recombinant FVIIa as a bypass agent is limited, and 
outcomes have been generally poor. Specific treatments to eradicate the 
antibodies based on immunosuppression with glucocorticoids, intrave-
nous immunoglobulin, or serial plasmapheresis have been sporadically 
reported.  Patients  should  be  advised  to  avoid  any  topical  thrombin 
sealant in the future.

The presence of lupus anticoagulant can be associated with venous or 
arterial thrombotic disease. However, bleeding has also been reported 
rarely  with  lupus  anticoagulants  due  to  antibodies  to  prothrombin, 
resulting in hypoprothrombinemia. Both disorders show a prolonged 
aPTT that does not correct on mixing. To distinguish acquired inhibi-
tors from lupus anticoagulant, note that the dilute Russell viper venom 
time (dRVVT) and the hexagonal-phase phospholipids test will be neg-
ative in patients with an acquired inhibitor and positive in patients with 
lupus anticoagulants. Moreover, lupus anticoagulant interferes with the 
clotting activity of many factors (FVIII, FIX, FXI, FXII), which can be 

assessed in the clinical laboratory; acquired inhibitors are specific to a 
single factor.

117 Arterial and Venous 
Thrombosis
Jane E. Freedman, Joseph Loscalzo

OVERVIEW OF THROMBOSIS
 ■ GENERAL OVERVIEW
Thrombosis,  the  obstruction  of  blood  flow  due  to  the  formation  of 
clot, may result in tissue anoxia and damage, and it is a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in a wide range of arterial and venous diseases 
and patient populations. As reported in 2020, 655,000 Americans die 
from  heart  disease  each  year,  accounting  for  about  1  in  4  deaths.  In 
2017, coronary disease killed 365,914 people in the United States, and 
approximately 805,000 people experienced a heart attack and 795,000 
had a stroke.

It is estimated that as many as 600,000 people each year have a pul-
monary embolism or deep-venous thrombotic event, and 60,000–80,000 
Americans  die  of  these  conditions  annually.  In  the  nondiseased  state, 
physiologic hemostasis reflects a delicate interplay between factors that 
promote and inhibit blood clotting, favoring the former. This response is 
crucial as it prevents uncontrolled hemorrhage and exsanguination fol-
lowing injury. In specific settings, the same processes that regulate nor-
mal hemostasis can cause pathologic thrombosis, leading to arterial or 
venous occlusion. Importantly, many commonly used therapeutic inter-
ventions may also alter the thrombotic–hemostatic balance adversely.

Hemostasis and thrombosis primarily involve the interplay among 
three factors: the vessel wall, coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins, and 
platelets. Many prevalent acute vascular diseases are due to thrombus 
formation within a vessel, including myocardial infarction, thrombotic 
cerebrovascular  events,  and  venous  thrombosis.  Although  the  end 
result  is  vessel  occlusion  and  tissue  ischemia,  the  pathophysiologic 
processes  governing  these  pathologies  have  similarities  as  well  as 
distinct differences. While many of the pathways regulating thrombus 
formation are similar to those that regulate hemostasis, the processes 
triggering or perpetuating thrombosis may be distinct and can vary in 
different clinical and genetic settings. In venous thrombosis, primary 
hypercoagulable  states  reflecting  defects  in  the  proteins  governing 
coagulation  and/or  fibrinolysis  or  secondary  hypercoagulable  states 
involving abnormalities of blood vessels and blood flow or stasis lead to

thrombosis. By contrast, arterial thrombo-
sis is highly dependent on the state of the 
vessel wall, the platelet, and factors related 
to blood flow.

ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS
 ■ OVERVIEW OF ARTERIAL 
THROMBOSIS
In  arterial  thrombosis,  platelets  and 
abnormalities  of  the  vessel  wall  typically 
play a key role in vessel occlusion. Arterial 
thrombus  forms  via  a  series  of  sequen-
tial  steps  in  which  platelets  adhere  to 
the  vessel  wall,  additional  platelets  are 
recruited,  and  thrombin 
is  activated  
(Fig.  117-1).  The  regulation  of  platelet 
adhesion,  activation,  aggregation,  and 
recruitment  will  be  described  in  detail 
below.  In  addition,  while  the  primary 
function of platelets is regulation of hemo-
stasis,  our  understanding  of  their  role  in 
other processes, such as immunity, metas-
tasis,  wound  healing,  and  inflammation, 
continues to evolve.
 ■ ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS 
AND VASCULAR DISEASE
Arterial  thrombosis  is  a  major  cause 
of  morbidity  and  mortality  both  in  the 
United  States  and,  increasingly,  world-
wide.  Although  the  rates  have  declined 
in  the  United  States,  the  overall  burden 
remains high. Overall, in 2020, heart dis-
ease  was  estimated  to  cause  about  1  of  every  4  deaths  in  the  United 
States.  In  addition  to  the  605,000  Americans  who  will  have  a  new 
coronary event annually, an additional 200,000 myocardial infarctions 
occur in those with previous heart attacks. Although the rate of strokes 
has fallen, each year about 795,000 people experience a new or recur-
rent ischemic stroke. In 2018, about 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular 
disease were due to stroke in the United States.

 ■ THE PLATELET
Many  processes  in  platelets  have  parallels  with  other  cell  types,  such 
as the presence of specific receptors and signaling pathways; however, 
unlike  most  cells,  platelets  lack  a  nucleus  and  are  unable  to  adapt 
to  changing  biologic  settings  by  altered  gene  transcription.  Plate-
lets  sustain  limited  protein  synthetic  capacity  from  megakaryocyte- 
derived and intracellularly transported messenger RNA (mRNA) and 
microRNA  (miRNA).  Most  of  the  molecules  needed  to  respond  to 
various stimuli, however, are maintained in storage granules and mem-
brane compartments.

Platelets  are  disc-shaped,  very  small,  anucleate  cells  (1–5  μm  in 
diameter) that circulate in the blood at concentrations of 200–400,000/
μL, with an average life span of 7–10 days. Platelets are derived from 
megakaryocytes,  polyploidal  hematopoietic  cells  found  in  the  bone 
marrow. The primary regulator of platelet formation is thrombopoietin 
(TPO). The precise mechanism by which megakaryocytes produce and 
release fully formed platelets is unclear, but the process likely involves 
formation of proplatelets, pseudopod-like structures generated by the 
evagination  of  the  cytoplasm  from  which  platelets  bud.  After  release 
into  the  circulation,  (young,  large)  platelets  may  continue  to  divide. 
Platelet granules are synthesized in megakaryocytes before thrombo-
poiesis and contain an array of prothrombotic, proinflammatory, and 
antimicrobial  mediators.  The  two  major  types  of  platelet  granules, 
alpha and dense, are distinguished by their size, abundance, and con-
tent.  Alpha-granules  contain  soluble  coagulation  proteins,  adhesion 
molecules,  growth  factors,  integrins,  cytokines,  and  inflammatory 
modulators.  Platelet  dense-granules  are  smaller  than  alpha-granules

FIGURE 117-1  Platelet activation and thrombosis. Platelets circulate in an inactive form in the vasculature. Damage to 
the endothelium and/or external stimuli activates platelets that adhere to the exposed subendothelial von Willebrand 
factor and collagen. This adhesion leads to activation of the platelet, shape change, and the synthesis and release 
of thromboxane (TxA2), serotonin (5-HT), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Platelet stimuli cause conformational 
change in the platelet integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, leading to the high-affinity binding of fibrinogen and 
the formation of a stable platelet thrombus.

and less abundant. Whereas alpha-granules contain proteins that may 
be  more  important  in  the  inflammatory  response,  dense-granules 
contain  high  concentrations  of  small  molecules,  including  adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP) and serotonin, that influence platelet aggregation 
and other related vascular processes, such as vasomotor tone.

Platelet Adhesion 
(See Fig. 117-1) The formation of a thrombus 
is  initiated  by  the  adherence  of  platelets  to  the  damaged  vessel  wall. 
Damage exposes subendothelial components responsible for triggering 
platelet reactivity, including collagen, von Willebrand factor, fibronec-
tin,  and  other  adhesive  proteins,  such  as  vitronectin  and  thrombo-
spondin. The hemostatic response may vary, depending on the extent 
of damage, the specific proteins exposed, and flow conditions. Certain 
proteins are expressed on the platelet surface that subsequently regulate 
collagen-induced  platelet  adhesion,  particularly  under  flow  condi-
tions, and include glycoprotein (GP) IV, GPVI, and the integrin α2β1. 
The platelet GPIb-IX-V complex adhesive receptor is central both to 
platelet  adhesion  and  to  the  initiation  of  platelet  activation.  Damage 
to the blood vessel wall exposes subendothelial von Willebrand factor 
and collagen to the circulating blood. The GPIb-IX-V complex binds 
to  the  exposed  von  Willebrand  factor,  causing  platelets  to  adhere  
(Fig. 117-1). In addition, the engagement of the GPIb-IX-V complex 
with ligand induces signaling pathways that lead to platelet activation. 
von Willebrand factor–bound GPIb-IX-V promotes a calcium-dependent 
conformational  change  in  the  GPIIb/IIIa  receptor,  transforming  it 
from  an  inactive  low-affinity  state  to  an  active  high-affinity  receptor 
for fibrinogen.

Platelet  Activation  The  activation  of  platelets  is  controlled  by  a 
variety of surface receptors that regulate various functions in the acti-
vation process. Platelet receptors control many distinct processes and 
are stimulated by a wide variety of agonists and adhesive proteins that 
result in variable degrees of activation. In general terms, the stimula-
tion of platelet receptors triggers two specific processes: (1) activation 
of  internal  signaling  pathways  that  lead  to  further  platelet  activation 
and granule release, and (2) the capacity of the platelet to bind to other

adhesive  proteins/platelets.  Both  of  these  processes  contribute  to  the 
formation  of  a  thrombus.  Stimulation  of  nonthrombotic  receptors 
results  in  platelet  adhesion  or  interaction  with  other  vascular  cells, 
including endothelial cells, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells.

Many  families  and  subfamilies  of  receptors  are  found  on  platelets 
that  regulate  a  variety  of  platelet  functions.  These  include  the  seven 
transmembrane receptor family, which is the main agonist-stimulated 
receptor family. Several seven transmembrane receptors are found on 
platelets,  including  the  ADP  receptors,  prostaglandin  receptors,  lipid 
receptors, and chemokine receptors. Receptors for thrombin comprise 
the major seven transmembrane receptors found on platelets. Among 
this last group, the first identified was the protease activation receptor 1  
(PAR1). The PAR class of receptors has a distinct mechanism of acti-
vation that involves specific cleavage of the N-terminus by thrombin, 
which, in turn, acts as a ligand for the receptor. Other PAR receptors 
are present on platelets, including PAR2 (not activated by thrombin) 
and  PAR4.  Adenosine  receptors  are  responsible  for  transduction  of 
ADP-induced  signaling  events,  which  are  initiated  by  the  binding  of 
ADP  to  purinergic  receptors  on  the  platelet  surface.  There  are  sev-
eral  distinct  ADP  receptors,  classified  as  P2X1,  P2Y1,  and  P2Y12.  The 
activation of both the P2Y12 and P2Y1 receptors is essential for ADP- 
induced  platelet  aggregation.  The  thienopyridine  derivatives,  clopi-
dogrel  and  prasugrel,  are  clinically  used  inhibitors  of  ADP-induced 
platelet aggregation.

Platelet  Aggregation  Activation  of  platelets  results  in  a  rapid 
series of signal transduction events, including tyrosine kinase, serine/
threonine kinase, and lipid kinase activation. In unstimulated platelets, 
the major platelet integrin GPIIb/IIIa is maintained in an inactive con-
formation and functions as a low-affinity adhesion receptor for fibrin-
ogen. This integrin is unique as it is only expressed on platelets. After 
stimulation, the interaction between fibrinogen and GPIIb/IIIa forms 
intercellular connections between platelets, leading to the formation of 
a  platelet  aggregate  (Fig.  117-1).  A  calcium-sensitive  conformational 
change  in  the  extracellular  domain  of  GPIIb/IIIa  enables  the  high- 
affinity binding of soluble plasma fibrinogen as a result of a complex 
network of inside-out signaling events. The GPIIb/IIIa receptor serves 
as  a  bidirectional  conduit  with  GPIIb/IIIa-mediated  signaling  (out-
side-in)  occurring  immediately  after  the  binding  of  fibrinogen.  This 
leads  to  additional  intracellular  signaling  that  further  stabilizes  the 
platelet aggregate and transforms platelet aggregation from a reversible 
to an irreversible process (inside-out).

 ■ THE ROLE OF PLATELETS AND THROMBOSIS IN 
INFLAMMATION
Inflammation  plays  an  important  role  during  the  acute  thrombotic 
phase of acute coronary and other vascular occlusive syndromes. In the 
setting of acute upper respiratory infections, people are at higher risk of 
myocardial infarction and thrombotic stroke. Patients with acute coro-
nary syndromes have not only increased interactions between platelets 
(homotypic aggregates), but also increased interactions between plate-
lets  and  leukocytes  (heterotypic  aggregates)  detectable  in  circulating 
blood. These latter aggregates form when platelets are activated, often 
directly by pathogens, and adhere to circulating leukocytes as part of 
their contribution to the immune process. Platelets bind via P-selectin 
(CD62P) expressed on the surface of activated platelets to the leukocyte 
receptor,  P-selectin  glycoprotein  ligand  1  (PSGL-1).  This  association 
leads to increased expression of CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) on leukocytes, 
which  amplifies  immunity  but  may  also  support  further  interactions 
with platelets partially via bivalent fibrinogen linking this integrin with 
its  platelet  surface  counterpart,  GPIIb/IIIa.  Platelet  surface  P-selectin 
also induces the expression of tissue factor on monocytes, which pro-
motes fibrin formation.

In  addition  to  platelet–monocyte  aggregates,  the  immunomod-
ulator,  soluble  CD40  ligand  (CD40L  or  CD154),  also  reflects  a  link 
between thrombosis and inflammation. The CD40 ligand is a trimeric 
transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor family and, with 
its  receptor  CD40,  is  an  important  contributor  to  the  inflammatory 
process  leading  both  to  thrombosis  and  atherosclerosis.  While  many 

immunologic and vascular cells have been found to express CD40 and/
or  CD40  ligand,  in  platelets,  CD40  ligand  is  rapidly  translocated  to 
the surface after stimulation and is upregulated in the newly formed 
thrombus.  The  surface-expressed  CD40  ligand  is  cleaved  from  the 
platelet to generate a soluble fragment (soluble CD40 ligand).

Links have also been established among platelets, infection, immu-
nity,  and  inflammation.  Bacterial  and  viral  infections  are  associated 
with a transient increase in the risk of acute thrombotic events, such 
as  acute  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke.  In  addition,  platelets  con-
tribute significantly to the pathophysiology and high mortality rates of 
sepsis.  The  expression,  functionality,  and  signaling  pathways  of  Toll-
like  receptors  (TLRs)  have  been  established  in  platelets.  Stimulation 
of platelet TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 directly and indirectly activates the 
platelet’s  thrombotic  and  inflammatory  responses,  and  live  bacteria 
induce a proinflammatory response in platelets in a TLR2-dependent 
manner, suggesting a mechanism by which specific bacteria and bac-
terial components can directly activate platelet-dependent thrombosis. 
Additionally, viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and 
Dengue,  are  also  known  to  cause  elevated  levels  of  thrombosis,  and 
recently,  platelets  have  been  shown  to  regulate  immune  responses  to 
viruses via receptors TLR7 and TLR8.

Risk Factors for Arterial Thrombosis 
In addition to immune 
burden, various factors increase the risk of developing arterial throm-
bosis. Classically, the cardiovascular-dependent risk factors implicated 
in  thrombosis  have  been  hypertension,  high  levels  of  low-density 
lipoprotein  cholesterol,  and  smoking.  However,  diabetes,  pregnancy, 
age,  and  chemotherapeutic  agents  may  also  contribute  to  arterial 
thrombosis.  Stillbirth  and  loss  of  multiple  pregnancies  may  increase 
the risk of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction as does hormonal 
replacement  therapy.  Systemic  lupus  erythematosus  and  rheumatoid 
arthritis are now well-recognized risks for thrombosis, and the former, 
in  particular,  may  contribute  in  the  pediatric  population.  The  anti-
phospholipid syndrome is also another widely recognized autoimmune 
prothrombotic risk for arterial (and venous) thrombosis.

 ■ GENETICS OF ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS
Some studies have associated arterial thrombosis with genetic variants 
(Table  117-1A);  however,  the  associations  have  been  weak  and  not 
confirmed  in  larger  series.  Platelet  count  and  mean  platelet  volume 
have  been  studied  by  genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS),  and 
this  approach  identified  signals  located  to  noncoding  regions.  Of  15 
quantitative trait loci associated with mean platelet volume and plate-
let count, one located at 12q24 is also a risk locus for coronary artery 
disease.

In the area of genetic variability and platelet function, studies have 
primarily  dealt  with  pharmacogenetics,  the  field  of  pharmacology 
dealing  with  the  interindividual  variability  in  drug  response  based 
on  genetic  determinants  (Table  117-2).  This  focus  has  been  driven 
by  the  wide  variability  among  individuals  in  terms  of  response  to 
antithrombotic  drugs  and  the  lack  of  a  common  explanation  for 
this  variance.  The  best  described  is  the  issue  of  “aspirin  resistance,” 
although heterogeneity for other antithrombotics (e.g., clopidogrel) has 
also been extensively examined. Primarily, platelet-dependent genetic 
determinants have been defined at the level of (1) drug effect, (2) drug 
compliance, and (3) drug metabolism. Many candidate platelet genes 
have been studied for their interaction with antiplatelet and antithrom-
botic agents.

Many patients have an inadequate response to the inhibitory effects 
of aspirin. Heritable factors contribute to the variability; however, ex 
vivo tests of residual platelet responsiveness after aspirin administra-
tion have not provided firm evidence for a pharmacogenetic interaction 
between aspirin and COX1 or other relevant platelet receptors. As such, 
currently,  there  is  no  clinical  indication  for  genotyping  to  optimize 
aspirin’s antiplatelet efficiency. For the platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor 
clopidogrel, additional data suggest that genetics may affect the drug’s 
responsiveness and utility. The responsible genetic variant appears not 
to be the expected P2Y12 receptor but an enzyme responsible for drug 
metabolism. Clopidogrel is a prodrug, and liver metabolism by specific

cytochrome P450 enzymes is required for activation. The genes encod-
ing the CYP-dependent oxidative steps are polymorphic, and carriers 
of  specific  alleles  of  the  CYP2C19  and  CYP3A4  loci  have  increased 
platelet aggregability. Increased platelet activity has also been specifi-
cally associated with the CYP2C19*2 allele, which causes loss of platelet 
function in select patients. Because these are common genetic variants, 
this  observation  has  been  shown  to  be  clinically  relevant  in  large 
studies. In summary, although the loss-of-function polymorphism in 
CYP2C19 is the strongest individual variable affecting pharmacokinet-
ics and antiplatelet response to clopidogrel, it only accounts for 5–12% 
of the variability in ADP-induced platelet aggregation on clopidogrel. 
In addition, genetic variables do not appear to contribute significantly 
to  the  clinical  outcomes  of  patients  treated  with  the  P2Y12  receptor

VENOUS THROMBOSIS
 ■ OVERVIEW OF VENOUS THROMBOSIS
Coagulation  is  the  process  by  which  thrombin  is  activated  and  solu-
ble  plasma  fibrinogen  is  converted  into  insoluble  fibrin.  These  steps 
account  for  both  normal  hemostasis  and  the  pathophysiologic  pro-
cesses influencing the development of venous thrombosis. The primary 
forms  of  venous  thrombosis  are  deep-vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  in  the 
extremities and the subsequent embolization to the lungs (pulmonary 
embolism [PE]), referred to together as venous thromboembolic dis-
ease (VTE). Although the majority of venous thromboembolic events 
occur as PE or DVT of the lower extremities, up to 10% of events may 
occur  in  other  vascular  locations.  Venous  thrombosis  occurs  due  to 
heritable causes (Table 117-1B) and acquired causes (Table 117-3).
 ■ DEEP-VENOUS THROMBOSIS AND PULMONARY 
EMBOLISM
It  is  estimated  that  DVT  or  PE  occurs  in  ~1–2  individuals  per  1000 
each year, resulting in 300,000–600,000 new cases of VTE each year in 
the United States. Approximately, 60,000–80,000 deaths are attributed 
to DVT or PE annually. Of new cases, up to 30% of patients die within 
30  days  and  one-fifth  suffer  sudden  death  due  to  PE;  30%  go  on  to 
develop recurrent VTE within 10 years. Data from the Atherosclerosis 
Risk in Communities (ARIC) study reported a 9% 28-day fatality rate 
from DVT and a 15% fatality rate from PE. PE in the setting of cancer 
has a 25% fatality rate. The mean incidence of first DVT in the general 
population  is  5  per  10,000  person-years;  the  incidence  is  similar  in 
males and females when adjusting for factors related to reproduction 
and  birth  control  and  increases  dramatically  with  age  from  2–3  per 
10,000 person-years at 30–49 years of age to 20 per 10,000 person-years 
at 70–79 years of age.
 ■ OVERVIEW OF THE COAGULATION CASCADE AND 
ITS ROLE IN VENOUS THROMBOSIS
Coagulation is defined as the formation of fibrin by a series of linked 
enzymatic reactions in which each reaction product converts the sub-
sequent inactive zymogen into an active serine protease (Fig. 117-2). 
This  coordinated  sequence  is  called  the  coagulation  cascade  and  is 
a key mechanism for regulating hemostasis. Central to the function 
of  the  coagulation  cascade  is  the  principle  of  amplification:  due  to 
a  series  of  linked  enzymatic  reactions,  a  small  stimulus  can  lead 
to  much  greater  quantities  of  fibrin,  the  end  product  that  prevents 
hemorrhage at the site of vascular injury. In addition to the known 
risk  factors  relevant  to  hypercoagulopathy,  stasis,  and  vascular  dys-
function, newer areas of research have identified contributions from 
procoagulant  microparticles,  inflammatory  cells,  microvesicles,  and 
fibrin structure.

The  coagulation  cascade  is  primarily  initiated  by  vascular  injury 
exposing tissue factor to blood components (Fig. 117-2). Tissue factor 
may  also  be  found  in  bloodborne  cell-derived  microparticles  and, 
under pathophysiologic conditions, in leukocytes or platelets. Plasma

FIGURE 117-2  Summary of the coagulation pathways. Specific coagulation factors (“a” indicates activated 
form) are responsible for the conversion of soluble plasma fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. This process 
occurs via a series of linked reactions in which the enzymatically active product subsequently converts the 
downstream inactive protein into an active serine protease. In addition, the activation of thrombin leads to 
stimulation of platelets. HK, high-molecular-weight kininogen; PK, prekallikrein; TF, tissue factor.

factor VII (FVII) is the ligand for and is activated (FVIIa) by binding 
to  tissue  factor  exposed  at  the  site  of  vessel  damage.  The  binding  of 
FVII/VIIa  to  tissue  factor  activates  the  downstream  conversion  of 
factor X (FX) to active FX (FXa). In an alternative reaction, the FVII/
FVIIa–tissue factor complex initially converts FIX to FIXa, which then 
activates FX in conjunction with its cofactor factor VIII (FVIIIa). Fac-
tor Xa with its cofactor FVa converts prothrombin to thrombin, which 
then converts soluble plasma fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, leading to 
clot or thrombus formation. Thrombin also activates FXIII to FXIIIa, 
a transglutaminase that covalently cross-links and stabilizes the fibrin 
clot. Formation of thrombi is affected by mechanisms governing fibrin 
structure and stability, including specific fibrinogen variants and how 
they alter fibrin formation, strength, and structure.

Several  antithrombotic  factors  also  regulate  coagulation;  these 
include antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), heparin 
cofactor II, and protein C/protein S. Under normal conditions, these 
factors limit the production of thrombin to prevent the perpetuation 
of  coagulation  and  thrombus  formation.  Typically,  after  the  clot  has 
caused  occlusion  at  the  damaged  site  and  begins  to  expand  toward 
adjacent  uninjured  vessel  segments,  the  anticoagulant  reactions  gov-
erned by the normal endothelium become pivotal in limiting the extent 
of this hemostatically protective clot.

 ■ RISK FACTORS FOR VENOUS THROMBOSIS
An array of different factors contributes to the risk of VTE, and it is 
notable that women and men of all ages, races, and ethnicities are at 
risk  for  VTE.  The  risk  factors  for  venous  thrombosis  are  primarily 
related  to  hypercoagulability,  which  can  be  genetic  (Table  117-1)  or 
acquired,  or  due  to  immobilization  and  venous  stasis.  Independent 
predictors  for  recurrence  include  increasing  age,  obesity,  malignant 
neoplasm,  and  acute  extremity  paresis.  It  is  estimated  that  5–8%  of 
the  U.S.  population  has  a  genetic  risk  factor  known  to  predispose 
to  venous  thrombosis.  Often,  multiple  risk  factors  are  present  in  a 
single  individual.  Significant  risk  is  incurred  by  major  orthopedic, 
abdominal,  or  neurologic  surgeries.  Cancer  patients  have  an  approx-
imately fourfold increased risk of VTE as compared with the general 
population,  and  cancer  patients  with  VTE  have  reduced  survival.

Hospitalized patients have a greatly increased risk 
of venous thrombosis with risk factors (increased 
age,  male,  ethnicity)  and  comorbid  conditions, 
including infection, renal disease, and weight loss. 
Community- or hospital-acquired infection is also 
associated with increased risk of VTE. Supportive 
of  this,  nearly  20%  of  hospitalized  COVID-19 
patients  are  noted  to  have  coagulation  abnormal-
ities as well as increased PE, DVT, and peripheral 
thrombotic risk. Moderate risk is promoted by pro-
longed bedrest, certain types of cancer, pregnancy, 
hormone  replacement  therapy  or  oral  contracep-
tive  use,  and  other  sedentary  conditions  such  as 
long-distance plane travel. It has been reported that 
the  risk  of  developing  a  venous  thromboembolic 
event doubles after air travel lasting 4 h, although 
the absolute risk remains low (1 in 6000). The rel-
ative risk of VTE among pregnant or postpartum 
women is 4.3, and the overall incidence (absolute 
risk) is 199.7 per 100,000 woman-years.
 ■ GENETICS OF VENOUS 
THROMBOSIS
(See  Table  117-2)  Less  common  causes  of  venous 
thrombosis are those due to genetic variants. These 
abnormalities include loss-of-function mutations of 
endogenous anticoagulants as well as gain-of-func-
tion mutations of procoagulant proteins. Heterozy-
gous antithrombin deficiency and homozygosity of 
the factor V Leiden mutation significantly increase 
the risk of venous thrombosis. While homozygous 
protein C or protein S deficiencies are rare and may 
lead to fatal purpura fulminans, heterozygous deficiencies are associated 
with a moderate risk of thrombosis. Activated protein C impairs coagu-
lation by proteolytic degradation of FVa. Patients resistant to the activity 
of activated protein C may have a point mutation in the FV gene located 
on chromosome 1, a mutant denoted factor V Leiden. Mildly increased 
risk  has  been  attributed  to  elevated  levels  of  procoagulant  factors,  as 
well as low levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Polymorphisms of 
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase as well as hyperhomocysteinemia 
have been shown to be independent risk factors for venous thrombosis, 
as well as arterial vascular disease; however, many of the initial descrip-
tions of genetic variants and their associations with thromboembolism 
are being questioned in larger, more contemporary studies.

 ■ FIBRINOLYSIS AND THROMBOSIS
Specific abnormalities in the fibrinolytic system have been associated 
with  enhanced  thrombosis.  Factors  such  as  elevated  levels  of  tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 
1 (PAI-1) have been associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity and 
an increased risk of arterial thrombotic disease. Specific genetic vari-
ants have been associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity, includ-
ing  the  4G/5G  insertion/deletion  polymorphism  in  the  PAI-1  gene. 
Additionally,  the  311-bp  Alu  insertion/deletion  in  tPA’s  intron  8  has 
been  associated  with  enhanced  thrombosis;  however,  genetic  abnor-
malities  have  not  been  associated  consistently  with  altered  function 
or  tPA  levels,  raising  questions  about  the  relevant  pathophysiologic 
mechanism.  Thrombin-activatable  fibrinolysis  inhibitor  (TAFI)  is  a 
carboxypeptidase  that  regulates  fibrinolysis;  elevated  plasma  TAFI 
levels  have  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  both  DVT  and 
cardiovascular disease.

The metabolic syndrome also is accompanied by altered fibrinolytic 
activity. This syndrome, which comprises abdominal fat (central obe-
sity), altered glucose and insulin metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hyper-
tension,  has  been  associated  with  atherothrombosis.  The  mechanism 
for  enhanced  thrombosis  appears  to  be  due  both  to  altered  platelet 
function and to a procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state. One of the 
most frequently documented prothrombotic abnormalities reported in 
this syndrome is an increase in plasma levels of PAI-1.

In addition to contributing to platelet function, inflammation plays 
a role in both coagulation-dependent thrombus formation and throm-
bus resolution. Both polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes/
macrophages  contribute  to  multiple  overlapping  thrombotic  func-
tions, including fibrinolysis, chemokine and cytokine production, and 
phagocytosis.

THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ARTERIAL 
AND VENOUS THROMBOSIS
Although there is overlap, venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis are 
initiated differently, and clot formation progresses by somewhat distinct 
pathways. In the setting of stasis or states of hypercoagulability, venous 
thrombosis  is  activated  with  the  initiation  of  the  coagulation  cascade 
primarily due to exposure of tissue factor; this leads to the formation of 
thrombin and the subsequent conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. In the 
artery, thrombin formation also occurs, but thrombosis is primarily pro-
moted by the adhesion of platelets to an injured vessel and stimulated 
by exposed extracellular matrix (Figs. 117-1 and 117-2). There is wide 
variation in individual responses to vascular injury, an important deter-
minant  of  which  is  the  predisposition  an  individual  has  to  arterial  or 
venous thrombosis. This concept has been supported indirectly in proth-
rombotic animal models in which there is poor correlation between the 
propensity to develop venous versus arterial thrombosis.

Despite  considerable  progress  in  understanding  the  role  of  hyper-
coagulable  states  in  VTE,  the  contribution  of  hypercoagulability 
to  arterial  vascular  disease  is  much  less  well  understood.  Although 
specific  thrombophilic  conditions,  such  as  factor  V  Leiden  and  the 
prothrombin G20210A mutation, are risk factors for DVT, pulmonary 
embolism, and other venous thromboembolic events, their contribu-
tion to arterial thrombosis is less well defined. In fact, to the contrary, 
many of these thrombophilic factors have not been found to be clini-
cally important risk factors for arterial thrombotic events, such as acute 
coronary syndromes.

Clinically,  although  the  pathophysiology  is  distinct,  arterial  and 
venous  thrombosis  do  share  common  risk  factors,  including  age, 
obesity,  cigarette  smoking,  diabetes  mellitus,  arterial  hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia,  and  metabolic  syndrome.  Select  genetic  variants, 
including those of the glutathione peroxidase-3 (GPx3) gene, have also 
been  associated  with  arterial  and  venous  thrombo-occlusive  disease. 
Importantly, arterial and venous thrombosis may both be triggered by 
pathophysiologic stimuli responsible for activating inflammatory and 
oxidative pathways.

in  Chap.  273.  Stroke  diagnosis  and  management  are  discussed  in

Thromboembolic disorders are major causes of morbidity and mortal-
ity. Thrombosis can occur in arteries or veins. Arterial thrombosis is 
the most common cause of acute myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic 
stroke,  and  limb  gangrene.  Venous  thromboembolism  encompasses 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to postthrombotic syn-
drome, and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can be fatal or can result 
in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Most  arterial  thrombi  are  superimposed  on  disrupted  atheroscle-
rotic plaque because plaque rupture exposes thrombogenic material in 
the core to the blood. This material then triggers platelet aggregation 
and fibrin formation, which results in the generation of a platelet-rich 
thrombus  that  can  temporarily  or  permanently  occlude  blood  flow. 
In  contrast,  venous  thrombi  rarely  form  at  sites  of  obvious  vascular 
disruption. Although they can develop after surgical trauma to veins 
or secondary to indwelling venous catheters, venous thrombi usually 
originate in the valve cusps of the deep veins of the calf or in the mus-
cular  sinuses.  Sluggish  blood  flow  reduces  the  oxygen  supply  to  the 
avascular valve cusps. Endothelial cells lining these valve cusps become 
activated and express adhesion molecules on their surface. Tissue factor–
bearing leukocytes and microvesicles adhere to these activated cells and 
induce coagulation. DNA extruded from neutrophils forms neutrophil 
extracellular  traps  (NETs)  that  provide  a  scaffold  that  binds  platelets 
and promotes their activation and aggregation and activate factor XII. 
Local thrombus formation is exacerbated by reduced clearance of acti-
vated clotting factors because of impaired blood flow. If the thrombi 
extend from the calf veins into the popliteal and more proximal veins 
of the leg, thrombus fragments can dislodge, travel to the lungs, and 
produce a PE.

Arterial and venous thrombi are composed of platelets, fibrin, and 
trapped  red  blood  cells,  but  the  proportions  differ.  Arterial  thrombi 
are rich in platelets because of the high shear in the injured arteries. 
In contrast, venous thrombi, which form under low shear conditions, 
contain  relatively  few  platelets  and  are  predominantly  composed  of 
fibrin and trapped red cells. Because of the predominance of platelets, 
arterial thrombi appear white, whereas venous thrombi are red in color, 
reflecting the trapped red cells.

Antithrombotic  drugs  are  used  for  prevention  and  treatment  of 
thrombosis. Targeting the components of thrombi, these agents include 
(1)  antiplatelet  drugs,  (2)  anticoagulants,  and  (3)  fibrinolytic  agents 
(Fig. 118-1). With the predominance of platelets in arterial thrombi, 
strategies to attenuate arterial thrombosis focus mainly on antiplatelet 
agents, although, in the acute setting, they may include anticoagulants 
and fibrinolytic agents. The addition of low-dose rivaroxaban, an oral 
factor Xa inhibitor, to dual-antiplatelet therapy reduces recurrent ische-
mic events and stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syn-
drome, whereas its addition to aspirin reduces the risk of major adverse 
coronary and limb events in patients with stable coronary or peripheral 
artery  disease.  These  findings  highlight  the  utility  of  combining  low

in patients at risk for recurrent atherothrombotic events.

Anticoagulants  are  the  mainstay  of  prevention  and  treatment  of 
venous  thromboembolism  because  fibrin  is  the  predominant  com-
ponent  of  venous  thrombi.  Antiplatelet  drugs  are  less  effective  than 
anticoagulants in this setting because of the limited platelet content of 
venous thrombi. Fibrinolytic therapy is used in selected patients with 
venous thromboembolism. For example, patients with massive PE can 
benefit  from  systemic  or  catheter-directed  fibrinolytic  therapy.  Phar-
maco-mechanical therapy also is used to restore blood flow in patients 
with extensive DVT involving the iliac and/or femoral veins.

ANTIPLATELET DRUGS
 ■ ROLE OF PLATELETS IN ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS
In  healthy  vasculature,  circulating  platelets  are  maintained  in  an 
inactive state by nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin released by endo-
thelial cells lining the blood vessels. In addition, endothelial cells also 
express CD39 on their surface, a membrane-associated ecto-adenosine 
diphosphatase  (ADPase)  that  degrades  ADP  released  from  activated 
platelets. When the vessel wall is damaged, release of these substances 
is  impaired  and  subendothelial  matrix  is  exposed.  Platelets  adhere 
to  exposed  collagen  via  α2β1  and  glycoprotein  (Gp)  V1  and  to  von  
Willebrand factor (VWF) via Gp Ibα and Gp IIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3)—receptors 
that are constitutively expressed on the platelet surface. Adherent plate-
lets undergo a change in shape, secrete ADP from their dense granules, 
and synthesize and release thromboxane A2. Released ADP and throm-
boxane A2, which are platelet agonists, activate ambient platelets and 
recruit them to the site of vascular injury (Fig. 118-2).

Disruption of the vessel wall also exposes tissue factor–expressing 
cells to the blood. Tissue factor binds factor VIIa and initiates coagula-
tion. Activated platelets potentiate coagulation by providing a surface 
that  binds  clotting  factors  and  supports  the  assembly  of  activation 
complexes that enhance thrombin generation. In addition to convert-
ing  fibrinogen  to  fibrin,  thrombin  serves  as  a  potent  platelet  agonist 
and recruits more platelets to the site of vascular injury. Thrombin also 
amplifies its own generation by feedback activation of factors V, VIII,

aggregation and activation of the coagulation system. Platelet activation is initiated 
by  exposure  of  subendothelial  collagen  and  von  Willebrand  factor  (VWF),  onto 
which  platelets  adhere.  Adherent  platelets  become  activated  and  release  ADP 
and thromboxane A2, platelet agonists that activate ambient platelets and recruit 
them to the site of injury. When platelets are activated, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on their 
surface  undergoes  a  conformational  change  that  enables  it  to  ligate  fibrinogen 
and/or  VWF  and  mediate  platelet  aggregation.  Coagulation  is  triggered  by  tissue 
factor exposed at the site of injury. Tissue factor triggers thrombin generation. As a 
potent platelet agonist, thrombin amplifies platelet recruitment to the site of injury. 
Thrombin also converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and the fibrin strands then weave the 
platelet aggregates together to form a platelet/fibrin thrombus.

and XI and solidifies the fibrin network by activating factor XIII, which 
then cross-links the fibrin strands.

When platelets are activated, Gp IIb/IIIa, the most abundant recep-
tor  on  the  platelet  surface,  undergoes  a  conformational  change  that 
enables it to bind fibrinogen and, under high shear conditions, VWF. 
Divalent  fibrinogen  or  multivalent  VWF  molecules  bridge  adjacent 
platelets together to form platelet aggregates. Fibrin strands, generated 
through the action of thrombin, then weave these aggregates together 
to form a platelet/fibrin mesh.

Antiplatelet drugs target various steps in this process. The commonly 
used drugs include aspirin, ADP receptor inhibitors, which include the 
thienopyridines  (clopidogrel  and  prasugrel)  as  well  as  ticagrelor  and 
cangrelor, dipyridamole, Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists, and vorapaxar.

 ■ ASPIRIN
The  most  widely  used  antiplatelet  agent  worldwide  is  aspirin.  As  a 
cheap and effective antiplatelet drug, aspirin serves as the foundation 
of most antiplatelet strategies.

Mechanism of Action  Aspirin produces its antithrombotic effect 
by  irreversibly  acetylating  and  inhibiting  platelet  cyclooxygenase 
(COX)-1 (Fig. 118-3), a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of throm-
boxane  A2.  At  high  doses  (~1  g/d),  aspirin  also  inhibits  COX-2,  an 
inducible  COX  isoform  found  in  endothelial  cells  and  inflammatory 
cells. In endothelial cells, COX-2 initiates the synthesis of prostacyclin, 
a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.

Indications  Aspirin is widely used for secondary prevention of car-
diovascular events in patients with established coronary artery, cerebral 
artery,  or  peripheral  artery  disease.  Compared  with  placebo  in  this 
setting, aspirin produces a 25% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular 
death, MI, or stroke. Use of aspirin for primary prevention is contro-
versial.  Recent  studies  have  questioned  whether  the  benefits  of  daily 
aspirin for primary cardiac protection outweigh its associated risks for 
gastrointestinal  and  intracerebral  hemorrhage.  Consequently,  aspirin 
is no longer recommended for primary cardiac prevention unless the 
baseline cardiovascular risk is at least 1% per year and 10% at 10 years 
and patients are at low risk for bleeding.

926 Dosages  Aspirin  is  usually  administered  at  doses  of  75–325  mg 
once daily. Higher doses of aspirin are not more effective than lower 
aspirin doses, and some analyses suggest reduced efficacy with higher 
doses. Because the side effects of aspirin are dose-related, daily aspirin 
doses  of  75–100  mg  are  recommended  for  most  indications.  When 
rapid platelet inhibition is required, an initial aspirin dose of at least 
160 mg should be given.

Side Effects  The most common side effects are gastrointestinal and 
range from dyspepsia to erosive gastritis or peptic ulcers with bleeding 
and  perforation.  These  side  effects  are  dose-related.  Use  of  enteric-
coated or buffered aspirin in place of plain aspirin does not eliminate 
gastrointestinal  side  effects.  The  overall  risk  of  major  bleeding  with 
aspirin  is  1–3%  per  year.  The  risk  of  bleeding  is  increased  two-  to 
threefold when aspirin is given in conjunction with other antiplatelet 
drugs,  such  as  clopidogrel,  or  with  anticoagulants,  such  as  warfarin. 
When dual or triple therapy is prescribed, low-dose aspirin should be 
given  (75–100  mg  daily).  Eradication  of  Helicobacter  pylori  infection 
and administration of proton pump inhibitors may reduce the risk of 
aspirin-induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with peptic 
ulcer disease.

Aspirin  should  not  be  administered  to  patients  with  a  history  of 
aspirin  allergy  characterized  by  bronchospasm.  This  problem  occurs 
in ~0.3% of the general population but is more common in those with 
chronic urticaria or asthma, particularly in individuals with nasal pol-
yps  or  chronic  rhinitis.  Hepatic  and  renal  toxicity  are  observed  with 
aspirin overdose.

Aspirin  Resistance  Clinical  aspirin  resistance  is  defined  as  the 
failure of aspirin to protect patients from ischemic vascular events. This 
is not a helpful definition because it is made after the event occurs. Fur-
thermore, it is not realistic to expect aspirin, which only blocks throm-
boxane A2–induced platelet activation, to prevent all vascular events.

Aspirin  resistance  has  also  been  described  biochemically  as  fail-
ure  of  the  drug  to  produce  its  expected  inhibitory  effects  on  tests  of 
platelet  function,  such  as  thromboxane  A2  synthesis  or  arachidonic 
acid-induced platelet aggregation. Potential causes of aspirin resistance 
include  poor  compliance,  reduced  absorption,  drug-drug  interaction 
with ibuprofen, and overexpression of COX-2. Unfortunately, the tests 
for aspirin resistance have not been well standardized, and there is little 
evidence that they identify patients at increased risk of recurrent vascu-
lar events, or that resistance can be reversed by giving higher doses of 
aspirin or by adding other antiplatelet drugs. Until such information is 
available, testing for aspirin resistance remains a research tool.

 ■ ADP RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS
The ADP receptor antagonists include the thienopyridines (clopidogrel 
and  prasugrel)  as  well  as  ticagrelor  and  cangrelor.  All  of  these  drugs 
target P2Y12, the key ADP receptor on platelets.
Thienopyridines  •  MECHANISM  OF  ACTION  The  thienopyri-
dines  are  structurally  related  drugs  that  selectively  inhibit  ADP- 
induced platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking P2Y12 (Fig. 118-3). 
Clopidogrel and prasugrel are prodrugs that require metabolic activa-
tion by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. Prasugrel 
is  about  10-fold  more  potent  than  clopidogrel  and  has  a  more  rapid 
onset  of  action  because  of  better  absorption  and  more  streamlined 
metabolic activation.
INDICATIONS  When  compared  with  aspirin  in  patients  with  recent 
ischemic stroke, recent MI, or a history of peripheral arterial disease, 
clopidogrel reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke by 
8.7%. Therefore, clopidogrel is more effective than aspirin but is also 
more expensive. Clopidogrel and aspirin are often combined to capi-
talize  on  their  capacity  to  block  complementary  pathways  of  platelet 
activation.  For  example,  the  combination  of  aspirin  plus  clopidogrel 
is  recommended  for  at  least  4  weeks  after  implantation  of  a  bare 
metal stent in a coronary artery and for at least a year in those with 
a  drug-eluting  stent.  Concerns  about  late  in-stent  thrombosis  with 
drug-eluting stents have led some experts to recommend long-term use 
of clopidogrel plus aspirin for the latter indication.

The  combination  of  clopidogrel  and  aspirin  is  also  effective  in 
patients with unstable angina. Thus, in 12,562 such patients, the risk 
of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was 9.3% in those randomized 
to  the  combination  of  clopidogrel  and  aspirin  and  11.4%  in  those 
given aspirin alone. This 20% relative risk reduction with combination 
therapy was highly statistically significant. However, combining clopi-
dogrel with aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding to about 2% per 
year. This bleeding risk persists even if the daily dose of aspirin is ≤100 mg. 
Therefore, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin should only be 
used when there is a clear benefit. For example, this combination has 
not proven to be superior to clopidogrel alone in patients with acute 
ischemic stroke or to aspirin alone for primary prevention in those at 
risk for cardiovascular events.

Prasugrel  was  compared  with  clopidogrel  in  13,608  patients  with 
acute  coronary  syndromes  who  were  scheduled  to  undergo  percuta-
neous  coronary  intervention.  The  incidence  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke, was sig-
nificantly lower with prasugrel than with clopidogrel (9.9% and 12.1%, 
respectively), mainly reflecting a reduction in the incidence of nonfatal 
MI. The incidence of stent thrombosis also was significantly lower with 
prasugrel  (1.1%  and  2.4%,  respectively).  However,  these  advantages 
were at the expense of significantly higher rates of fatal bleeding (0.4% 
and 0.1%, respectively) and life-threatening bleeding (1.4% and 0.9%, 
respectively) with prasugrel. Because patients older than age 75 years 
and  those  with  a  history  of  prior  stroke  or  transient  ischemic  attack 
have a particularly high risk of bleeding, prasugrel should generally be 
avoided in older patients, and the drug is contraindicated in those with 
a  history  of  cerebrovascular  disease.  Caution  is  required  if  prasugrel 
is  used  in  patients  weighing  less  than  60  kg  or  in  those  with  renal 
impairment.

When  prasugrel  was  compared  with  clopidogrel  in  7243  patients 
with  unstable  angina  or  MI  without  ST-segment  elevation,  prasugrel 
failed to reduce the rate of the primary efficacy endpoint, which was a 
composite of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke. Because of the neg-
ative results of this study, prasugrel is reserved for patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention. In this setting, prasugrel is usually 
given in conjunction with aspirin. To reduce the risk of bleeding, the 
daily aspirin dose should be ≤100 mg.

For  patients  with  noncardioembolic  stroke  or  high-risk  transient 
ischemic attack, the combination of clopidogrel or ticagrelor plus aspi-
rin for 21–30 days followed by aspirin alone thereafter reduces the risk 
of stroke, MI, and vascular death by up to 30% compared with aspirin 
alone. Therefore, dual antiplatelet therapy is often administered for the 
first 3–4 weeks in such patients.
DOSING  Clopidogrel is given once daily at a dose of 75 mg. Loading 
doses  of  clopidogrel  are  given  when  rapid  ADP  receptor  blockade  is 
desired. For example, patients undergoing coronary stenting are often 
given  a  loading  dose  of  300–600  mg,  which  produces  inhibition  of 
ADP-induced platelet aggregation in about 4–6 h. After a loading dose 
of 60 mg, prasugrel is given once daily at a dose of 10 mg. Patients older 
than age 75 years or weighing less than 60 kg should receive a lower 
daily prasugrel dose of 5 mg.
SIDE  EFFECTS  The  most  common  side  effect  of  clopidogrel  and 
prasugrel is bleeding. Because of its greater potency, bleeding is more 
common with prasugrel than clopidogrel. To reduce the risk of bleed-
ing, clopidogrel and prasugrel should be stopped 5–7 days before major 
surgery. In patients taking clopidogrel or prasugrel who present with 
serious bleeding, platelet transfusion may be helpful.

Hematologic side effects, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 

and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, are rare.
THIENOPYRIDINE RESISTANCE  The capacity of clopidogrel to inhibit 
ADP-induced  platelet  aggregation  varies  among  subjects.  This  vari-
ability  reflects,  at  least  in  part,  genetic  polymorphisms  in  the  CYP 
isoenzymes involved in the metabolic activation of clopidogrel. Most 
important of these is CYP2C19. Clopidogrel-treated patients with the 
loss-of-function  CYP2C19*2  allele  exhibit  reduced  platelet  inhibition 
compared with those with the wild-type CYP2C19*1 allele and experi-
ence a higher rate of cardiovascular events. This is important because

estimates suggest that up to 25% of whites, 30% of African Americans, 
and  50%  of  Asians  carry  the  loss-of-function  allele,  which  would 
render  them  resistant  to  clopidogrel.  Even  patients  with  the  reduced 
function  CYP2C19*3,  *4,  or  *5  alleles  may  derive  less  benefit  from 
clopidogrel than those with the full-function CYP2C19*1 allele. Con-
comitant administration of clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors, 
which  are  inhibitors  of  CYP2C19,  produces  a  small  reduction  in  the 
inhibitory effects of clopidogrel on ADP-induced platelet aggregation. 
The extent to which this interaction increases the risk of cardiovascular 
events remains controversial.

In contrast to their effect on the metabolic activation of clopidogrel, 
CYP2C19  polymorphisms  appear  to  be  less  important  determinants 
of  the  activation  of  prasugrel.  Thus,  no  association  was  detected 
between  the  loss-of-function  allele  and  decreased  platelet  inhibition 
or  increased  rate  of  cardiovascular  events  with  prasugrel.  The  obser-
vation  that  genetic  polymorphisms  affecting  clopidogrel  absorption 
or  metabolism  influence  clinical  outcomes  raises  the  possibilities 
that pharmacogenetic profiling may be useful to identify clopidogrel- 
resistant  patients  and  that  point-of-care  assessment  of  the  extent 
of  clopidogrel-induced  platelet  inhibition  may  help  detect  patients 
at  higher  risk  for  subsequent  cardiovascular  events.  Clinical  trials 
designed  to  evaluate  these  possibilities  have  thus  far  been  negative. 
Although administration of higher doses of clopidogrel can overcome 
a reduced response to clopidogrel, the clinical benefit of this approach 
is uncertain. Instead, prasugrel or ticagrelor may be better choices for 
these patients.

Ticagrelor  As an orally active inhibitor of P2Y12, ticagrelor differs 
from the thienopyridines in that ticagrelor does not require metabolic 
activation and it produces reversible inhibition of the ADP receptor.
MECHANISM OF ACTION  Like the thienopyridines, ticagrelor inhibits 
P2Y12. Because it does not require metabolic activation, ticagrelor has a 
more rapid onset and offset of action than clopidogrel, and it produces 
greater and more predictable inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggre-
gation than clopidogrel.
INDICATIONS  Ticagrelor is indicated for the secondary prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in patients with an acute coronary syndrome 
treated  medically  or  with  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI) 
with  or  without  stent  implantation  or  with  coronary  artery  bypass 
graft (CABG) surgery. Ticagrelor also is indicated for up to 3 years for 
secondary prevention in patients with a prior history of MI at least one 
year ago who are at high risk for atherothrombotic events. For patients 
with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, guidelines give pref-
erence  to  ticagrelor  over  clopidogrel.  Guidelines  give  preference  to 
ticagrelor over clopidogrel, particularly in higher risk patients.
DOSING  Ticagrelor is initiated with an oral loading dose of 180 mg 
followed by 90 mg twice daily. The dose does not require adjustment 
in patients with renal impairment, but the drug should be used with 
caution in patients with hepatic disease and in those receiving potent 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 because ticagrelor is metabolized in 
the liver via CYP3A4. Ticagrelor is usually administered in conjunction 
with aspirin; the daily aspirin dose should not exceed 100 mg.
SIDE EFFECTS  In addition to bleeding, the most common side effects 
of  ticagrelor  are  dyspnea,  which  can  occur  in  up  to  15%  of  patients, 
and  asymptomatic  ventricular  pauses.  The  dyspnea,  which  tends  to 
occur soon after initiating ticagrelor, is usually self-limiting and mild in 
intensity. The mechanism responsible for this side effect is unknown.

To reduce the risk of bleeding, ticagrelor should be stopped at least 
5  days  before  major  surgery.  Platelet  transfusion  is  unlikely  to  be  of 
benefit in patients with ticagrelor-related bleeding or in those requiring 
urgent surgery because the drug will bind to P2Y12 on the transfused 
platelets.  Bentracimab,  an  antibody  fragment  that  binds  ticagrelor 
and its metabolite with high affinity and rapidly reverses their platelet 
inhibitory effects, is under development for ticagrelor reversal prior to 
urgent surgery or intervention or for patients with serious bleeding.

Cangrelor  Cangrelor is a rapidly acting reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 
that is administered intravenously. It has an immediate onset of action, 

a half-life of 3–5 min, and an offset of action within an hour. Cangre-
lor is licensed for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention  and  produces  rapid  ADP  receptor  blockade  in  those 
who  have  not  received  pretreatment  with  clopidogrel,  prasugrel,  or 
ticagrelor.

Cangrelor is administered as a 30 μg/kg IV bolus prior to percuta-
neous  coronary  intervention  followed  by  an  infusion  of  4  μg/kg  per 
minute for at least 2 h or for the duration of the procedure, whichever 
is longer. When transitioning to oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy, ticagrelor 
can be given at a loading dose of 180 mg at any time during the cangre-
lor infusion or immediately after discontinuation. In contrast, loading 
doses of prasugrel or clopidogrel (60 and 600 mg, respectively) should 
only be given after cangrelor is stopped because cangrelor blocks the 
interaction of their active metabolites with P2Y12.

 ■ DIPYRIDAMOLE
Dipyridamole is a relatively weak antiplatelet agent on its own, but an 
extended-release  formulation  of  dipyridamole  combined  with  low-
dose aspirin, a preparation known as Aggrenox, is sometimes used for 
secondary  prevention  in  patients  with  transient  ischemic  attacks  or 
ischemic stroke.

Mechanism of Action  By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, dipyrida-
mole  blocks  the  breakdown  of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate 
(AMP).  Increased  levels  of  cyclic  AMP  reduce  intracellular  calcium 
and inhibit platelet activation. Dipyridamole also blocks the uptake of 
adenosine by platelets and other cells. This produces a further increase 
in local cyclic AMP levels because the platelet adenosine A2 receptor is 
coupled to adenylate cyclase (Fig. 118-4).

Indications  Dipyridamole plus aspirin was compared with aspirin 
or dipyridamole alone, or with placebo, in patients with an ischemic 
stroke or transient ischemic attack. The combination reduced the risk 
of  stroke  by  22.1%  compared  with  aspirin  and  by  24.4%  compared 
with dipyridamole. A second trial compared dipyridamole plus aspirin 
with aspirin alone for secondary prevention in patients with ischemic 
stroke.  Vascular  death,  stroke,  or  MI  occurred  in  13%  of  patients 
given  combination  therapy  and  in  16%  of  those  treated  with  aspirin 
alone.  Another  trial  randomized  20,332  patients  with  noncardioem-
bolic ischemic stroke to either Aggrenox or clopidogrel. The primary 
efficacy endpoint of recurrent stroke occurred in 9.0% of those given 
Aggrenox and in 8.8% of patients treated with clopidogrel. Although 
this difference was not statistically significant, the study failed to meet 
the  prespecified  margin  to  claim  noninferiority  of  Aggrenox  relative 
to  clopidogrel.  These  results  have  dampened  enthusiasm  for  the  use 
of Aggrenox.

Because of its vasodilatory effects and the paucity of data supporting 
the use of dipyridamole in patients with symptomatic coronary artery 
disease,  Aggrenox  should  not  be  used  for  stroke  prevention  in  such 
patients. Clopidogrel is a better choice in this setting.

Dosing  Aggrenox  is  given  twice  daily.  Each  capsule  contains  
200 mg of extended-release dipyridamole and 25 mg of aspirin.

Side  Effects  Because  dipyridamole  has  vasodilatory  effects,  it 
must  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease. 
Gastrointestinal  complaints,  headache,  facial  flushing,  dizziness,  and 
hypotension can also occur. These symptoms often subside with con-
tinued use of the drug.

 ■ GP IIB/IIIA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS
As a class, parenteral Gp IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists have a niche in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome. The three agents in this class 
are abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban.

Mechanism of Action  A member of the integrin family of adhe-
sion  receptors,  Gp  IIb/IIIa  is  found  on  the  surface  of  platelets  and 
megakaryocytes.  With  about  80,000  copies  per  platelet,  Gp  IIb/IIIa 
is  the  most  abundant  receptor.  Consisting  of  a  noncovalently  linked 
heterodimer, Gp IIb/IIIa is inactive on resting platelets. When platelets

FIGURE 118-4  Mechanism of action of dipyridamole. Dipyridamole increases levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in platelets 
by (1) blocking the reuptake of adenosine and (2) inhibiting phosphodiesterase-mediated cyclic AMP degradation. By 
promoting calcium uptake, cyclic AMP reduces intracellular levels of calcium. This, in turn, inhibits platelet activation 
and aggregation.

Dosing  All  of  the  Gp  IIb/IIIa  antag-
onists  are  given  as  an  IV  bolus  followed 
by  an  infusion.  The  recommended  dose 
of  abciximab  is  a  bolus  of  0.25  mg/kg 
followed  by  an  infusion  of  0.125  μg/kg 
per minute to a maximum of 10 μg/kg for 
12  h.  In  patients  undergoing  percutaneous 
coronary  intervention,  eptifibatide  is  given 
as  two  180  μg/kg  boluses  given  10  min 
apart, followed by an infusion of 2.0 μg/kg 
per minute for 18–24 h. For patients with 
acute  coronary  syndrome,  the  second 
eptifibatide bolus is withheld. Tirofiban is 
started at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg per minute for  
30  min;  the  drug  is  then  continued  at  a 
rate of 0.1 μg/kg per minute for up to 18 h.  
Because  eptifibatide  and  tirofiban  are 
cleared  by  the  kidneys,  the  doses  must 
be reduced in patients with renal insuffi-
ciency. Thus, the eptifibatide infusion is 
reduced to 1 μg/kg per minute in patients 
with a creatinine clearance below 50 mL/
min,  whereas  the  dose  of  tirofiban  is 
cut in half for patients with a creatinine 
clearance below 30 mL/min.

are  activated,  inside-outside  signal  transduction  pathways  trigger  a 
conformational activation of the receptor. Once activated, Gp IIb/IIIa 
binds  adhesive  molecules,  such  as  fibrinogen  and,  under  high  shear 
conditions,  VWF.  Binding  is  mediated  by  the  Arg-Gly-Asp  (RGD) 
sequence found on the α chains of fibrinogen and on VWF, and by the 
Lys-Gly-Asp (KGD) sequence located within a unique dodecapeptide 
domain on the γ chains of fibrinogen. Once bound, fibrinogen and/or 
VWF bridge adjacent platelets together to induce platelet aggregation.
Although  abciximab,  eptifibatide,  and  tirofiban  all  target  the  Gp 
IIb/IIIa receptor, they are structurally and pharmacologically distinct 
(Table  118-1).  Abciximab  is  a  Fab  fragment  of  a  humanized  murine 
monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  the  activated  form  of  Gp  IIb/
IIIa. Abciximab binds to the activated receptor with high affinity and 
blocks the binding of adhesive molecules. In contrast, eptifibatide and 
tirofiban are synthetic small molecules. Eptifibatide is a cyclic hepta-
peptide that binds Gp IIb/IIIa because it incorporates the KGD motif, 
whereas  tirofiban  is  a  nonpeptidic  tyrosine  derivative  that  acts  as  an 
RGD mimetic. Abciximab has a long half-life and can be detected on 
the surface of platelets for up to 2 weeks; eptifibatide and tirofiban have 
short half-lives.

Indications  Abciximab and eptifibatide are used in patients under-
going  percutaneous  coronary  interventions,  particularly  those  who 
have not been pretreated with an ADP receptor antagonist. Tirofiban 
is used in high-risk patients with unstable angina. Eptifibatide also can 
be used for this indication.

Side Effects 
In addition to bleeding, 
thrombocytopenia  is  the  most  serious 
complication. Thrombocytopenia is immune-mediated and is caused 
by  antibodies  directed  against  neoantigens  on  Gp  IIb/IIIa  that  are 
exposed upon antagonist binding. With abciximab, thrombocytopenia 
occurs in up to 5% of patients. Thrombocytopenia is severe in ~1% of 
these  individuals.  Thrombocytopenia  is  less  common  with  the  other 
two agents, occurring in ~1% of patients.
 ■ VORAPAXAR
An orally active PAR-1 antagonist, vorapaxar blocks thrombin-induced 
platelet activation. Vorapaxar has a half-life of about 200 h. 

Indications  When compared with placebo in 12,944 patients with 
acute  coronary  syndrome  without  ST-segment  elevation,  vorapaxar 
failed to significantly reduce the primary efficacy endpoint, a compos-
ite  of  cardiovascular  death,  MI,  stroke,  recurrent  ischemia  requiring 
rehospitalization,  and  urgent  coronary  revascularization.  Moreover, 
vorapaxar  was  associated  with  increased  rates  of  bleeding,  including 
intracranial bleeding.

In a second trial, vorapaxar was compared with placebo for secondary 
prevention in 26,449 patients with prior MI, ischemic stroke, or periph-
eral arterial disease. Overall, vorapaxar reduced the risk for cardiovas-
cular death, MI, or stroke by 13%, but doubled the risk of intracranial 
bleeding. In the prespecified subgroup of 17,779 patients with prior MI, 
however,  vorapaxar  reduced  the  risk  for  cardiovascular  death,  MI,  or 
stroke by 20% compared with placebo (from 9.7% to 8.1%, respectively). 
The rate of intracranial hemorrhage was higher with vorapaxar than with 
placebo (0.6% and 0.4%, respectively; p = .076) as was the rate of moder-
ate or severe bleeding (3.4% and 2.1%, respectively; p <.0001). Based on 
these data, vorapaxar is licensed for patients younger than 75 years with 
MI or peripheral artery disease who have no history of stroke, transient 
ischemic attack, or intracranial bleeding and weigh more than 60 kg.

Dosing  Vorapaxar is given at a dose of 2.08 mg once daily.
Side Effects  The major side effect is bleeding. Platelet transfusion 
may be of benefit for vorapaxar reversal.

ANTICOAGULANTS
There are both parenteral and oral anticoagulants. The parenteral anti-
coagulants include heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), 
fondaparinux  (a  synthetic  pentasaccharide),  lepirudin,  desirudin, 
bivalirudin,  and  argatroban.  Currently  available  oral  anticoagulants

 ■ PARENTERAL 
ANTICOAGULANTS
Heparin  A  sulfated  polysaccharide, 
heparin is isolated from mammalian tissues 
rich in mast cells. Most commercial heparin 
is  derived  from  porcine  intestinal  mucosa 
and is a polymer of alternating d-glucuronic 
acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues.

MECHANISM  OF  ACTION  Heparin  acts  as 
an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin 
(previously known as antithrombin III) and 
accelerating  the  rate  at  which  antithrombin 
inhibits  clotting  enzymes,  particularly 
thrombin  and  factor  Xa.  Antithrombin,  the 
obligatory  plasma  cofactor  for  heparin,  is  a 
member of the serine protease inhibitor (ser-
pin) superfamily. Synthesized in the liver and 
circulating  in  plasma  at  a  concentration  of 
2.6 ± 0.4 μM, antithrombin acts as a suicide 
substrate for its target enzymes.

To  activate  antithrombin,  heparin  binds 
to  the  serpin  via  a  unique  pentasaccharide 
sequence  that  is  found  on  one-third  of  the 
chains  of  commercial  heparin  (Fig.  118-5). 
Heparin chains without this pentasaccharide 
sequence have little or no anticoagulant activ-
ity.  Once  bound  to  antithrombin,  heparin 
induces a conformational change in the reac-
tive center loop of antithrombin that renders it 
more readily accessible to its target proteases. 
This conformational change enhances the rate 
at  which  antithrombin  inhibits  factor  Xa  by 
at least two orders of magnitude but has little 
effect on the rate of thrombin inhibition. To 
catalyze  thrombin  inhibition,  heparin  serves 
as  a  template  that  binds  antithrombin  and 
thrombin  simultaneously.  Formation  of  this 
ternary  complex  brings  the  enzyme  in  close 
apposition  to  the  inhibitor,  thereby  promot-
ing the formation of a stable covalent thrombin-antithrombin complex.
Only pentasaccharide-containing heparin chains composed of at least 
18 saccharide units (which correspond to a molecular weight of 5400) 
are of sufficient length to bridge thrombin and antithrombin together. 
With a mean molecular weight of 15,000, and a range of 5000–30,000, 
almost all of the chains of unfractionated heparin are long enough to 
do so. Consequently, by definition, heparin has equal capacity to pro-
mote  the  inhibition  of  thrombin  and  factor  Xa  by  antithrombin  and 
is assigned an anti-factor Xa to anti-factor IIa (thrombin) ratio of 1:1.

Heparin causes the release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) 
from  the  endothelium.  A  factor  Xa–dependent  inhibitor  of  tissue 
factor–bound factor VIIa, TFPI may contribute to the antithrombotic 
activity of heparin. Longer heparin chains induce the release of more 
TFPI than shorter ones.

PHARMACOLOGY  Heparin  must  be  given  parenterally.  It  is  usually 
administered  SC  or  by  continuous  IV  infusion.  When  used  for  ther-
apeutic  purposes,  the  IV  route  is  most  often  employed.  If  heparin  is 
given  SC  for  treatment  of  thrombosis,  the  dose  of  heparin  must  be 
high  enough  to  overcome  the  limited  bioavailability  associated  with 
this method of delivery.

In the circulation, heparin binds to the endothelium and to plasma 
proteins  other  than  antithrombin.  Heparin  binding  to  endothelial 

FIGURE  118-5  Mechanism  of  action  of  heparin,  low-molecular-weight  heparin  (LMWH),  and  fondaparinux,  a 
synthetic pentasaccharide. A. Heparin binds to antithrombin via its pentasaccharide sequence. This induces a 
conformational change in the reactive center loop of antithrombin that accelerates its interaction with factor Xa. 
To potentiate thrombin inhibition, heparin must simultaneously bind to antithrombin and thrombin. Only heparin 
chains composed of at least 18 saccharide units, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 5400, are of sufficient 
length to perform this bridging function. With a mean molecular weight of 15,000, all of the heparin chains are long 
enough to do this. B. LMWH has greater capacity to potentiate factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin than thrombin 
because, with a mean molecular weight of 4500–5000, at least half of the LMWH chains are too short to bridge 
antithrombin to thrombin. C. The pentasaccharide only accelerates factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin because 
the pentasaccharide is too short to bridge antithrombin to thrombin.

cells  explains  its  dose-dependent  clearance.  At  low  doses,  the  half-
life  of  heparin  is  short  because  it  binds  rapidly  to  the  endothelium. 
With  higher  doses  of  heparin,  the  half-life  is  longer  because  heparin 
is cleared more slowly once the endothelium is saturated. Clearance is 
mainly  extra  renal;  heparin  binds  to  macrophages,  which  internalize 
and depolymerize the long heparin chains and secrete shorter chains 
back  into  the  circulation.  Because  of  its  dose-dependent  clearance 
mechanism, the plasma half-life of heparin ranges from 30 to 60 min 
with bolus IV doses of 25 and 100 units/kg, respectively.

Once  heparin  enters  the  circulation,  it  binds  to  plasma  proteins 
other than antithrombin, a phenomenon that reduces its anticoagulant 
activity.  Some  of  the  heparin-binding  proteins  found  in  plasma  are 
acute-phase reactants whose levels are elevated in ill patients. Others, 
such as high-molecular-weight multimers of VWF, are released from 
activated platelets or endothelial cells. Activated platelets also release 
platelet  factor  4  (PF4),  a  highly  cationic  protein  that  binds  heparin 
with high affinity. The large amounts of PF4 found in the vicinity of 
platelet-rich arterial thrombi can neutralize the anticoagulant activity 
of heparin. This phenomenon may attenuate heparin’s capacity to sup-
press thrombus growth.

Because  the  levels  of  heparin-binding  proteins  in  plasma  vary 
from  person  to  person,  the  anticoagulant  response  to  fixed  or  weight- 
adjusted doses of heparin is unpredictable. Consequently, coagulation

930 monitoring is essential to ensure that a therapeutic response is obtained. 
This is particularly important when heparin is administered for treat-
ment of established thrombosis because a subtherapeutic anticoagulant 
response may render patients at risk for recurrent thrombosis, whereas 
excessive anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding.

MONITORING  THE  ANTICOAGULANT  EFFECT  Heparin  therapy  can 
be monitored using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
or anti–factor Xa level. Although the aPTT is the test most often used 
for  this  purpose,  there  are  problems  with  this  assay.  aPTT  reagents 
vary in their sensitivity to heparin, and the type of coagulometer used 
for  testing  can  influence  the  results.  Consequently,  laboratories  must 
establish  a  therapeutic  aPTT  range  with  each  reagent-coagulometer 
combination by measuring the aPTT and anti–factor Xa level in plasma 
samples collected from heparin-treated patients. For most of the aPTT 
reagents and coagulometers in current use, therapeutic heparin levels 
are achieved with a two- to threefold prolongation of the aPTT. Anti–
factor Xa levels also can be used to monitor heparin therapy. With this 
test, therapeutic heparin levels range from 0.3 to 0.7 units/mL.

Up  to  25%  of  heparin-treated  patients  with  venous  thromboem-
bolism require >35,000 units/d to achieve a therapeutic aPTT. These 
patients  are  considered  heparin  resistant.  It  is  useful  to  measure 
anti–factor  Xa  levels  in  heparin-resistant  patients  because  many  will 
have a therapeutic anti–factor Xa level despite a subtherapeutic aPTT. 
This dissociation in test results occurs because elevated plasma levels 
of fibrinogen and factor VIII, both of which are acute-phase proteins, 
shorten the aPTT but have no effect on anti–factor Xa levels. Heparin 
therapy  in  patients  who  exhibit  this  phenomenon  is  best  monitored 
using anti–factor Xa levels instead of the aPTT. Patients with congeni-
tal or acquired antithrombin deficiency and those with elevated levels 
of  heparin-binding  proteins  may  also  need  high  doses  of  heparin  to 
achieve  a  therapeutic  aPTT  or  anti–factor  Xa  level.  If  there  is  good 
correlation between the aPTT and the anti–factor Xa levels, either test 
can be used to monitor heparin therapy.

DOSING  For  prophylaxis,  heparin  is  usually  given  in  fixed  doses  of 
5000 units SC two or three times daily. With these low doses, coagu-
lation monitoring is unnecessary. In contrast, monitoring is essential 
when  the  drug  is  given  in  therapeutic  doses.  Fixed-dose  or  weight-
based heparin nomograms are used to standardize heparin dosing and 
to  shorten  the  time  required  to  achieve  a  therapeutic  anticoagulant 
response.  At  least  two  heparin  nomograms  have  been  validated  in 
patients with venous thromboembolism and reduce the time required 
to  achieve  a  therapeutic  aPTT.  Weight-adjusted  heparin  nomograms 
have also been evaluated in patients with acute coronary syndromes. 
After  an  IV  heparin  bolus  of  5000  units  or  70  units/kg,  a  heparin 
infusion  rate  of  12–15  units/kg  per  hour  is  usually  administered.  In 
contrast, weight-adjusted heparin nomograms for patients with venous 
thromboembolism  use  an  initial  bolus  of  5000  units  or  80  units/kg, 
followed  by  an  infusion  of  18  units/kg  per  hour.  Thus,  patients  with 
venous  thromboembolism  appear  to  require  higher  doses  of  heparin 
to  achieve  a  therapeutic  aPTT  than  do  patients  with  acute  coronary 
syndromes. This may reflect differences in the thrombus burden. Hep-
arin binds to fibrin, and the amount of fibrin in patients with extensive 
DVT is greater than that in those with coronary thrombosis.

LIMITATIONS  Heparin  has  pharmacokinetic  and  biophysical  lim-
itations (Table 118-2). The pharmacokinetic limitations reflect hep-
arin’s  propensity  to  bind  in  a  pentasaccharide-independent  fashion 
to  cells  and  plasma  proteins.  Heparin  binding  to  endothelial  cells 
explains  its  dose-dependent  clearance,  whereas  binding  to  plasma 
proteins results in a variable anticoagulant response and can lead to 
heparin resistance.

The  biophysical  limitations  of  heparin  reflect  the  inability  of  the 
heparin-antithrombin  complex  to  inhibit  factor  Xa  when  it  is  incor-
porated into the prothrombinase complex, the complex that converts 
prothrombin  to  thrombin,  and  to  inhibit  thrombin  bound  to  fibrin. 
Consequently,  factor  Xa  bound  to  activated  platelets  within  plate-
let-rich  thrombi  has  the  potential  to  generate  thrombin,  even  in  the 
face of heparin. Once this thrombin binds to fibrin, it too is protected

from inhibition by the heparin-antithrombin complex. Clot-associated 
thrombin can then trigger thrombus growth by locally activating plate-
lets  and  amplifying  its  own  generation  through  feedback  activation 
of  factors  V,  VIII,  and  XI.  Further  compounding  the  problem  is  the 
potential for heparin neutralization by the high concentrations of PF4 
released from activated platelets within the platelet-rich thrombus.
SIDE EFFECTS  The most common side effect of heparin is bleeding. 
Other  complications  include  thrombocytopenia,  osteoporosis,  and 
elevated levels of transaminases.
Bleeding  The risk of bleeding rises as the dose of heparin is increased. 
Concomitant  administration  of  drugs  that  affect  hemostasis,  such  as 
antiplatelet or fibrinolytic agents, increases the risk of bleeding, as does 
recent surgery or trauma. Heparin-treated patients with serious bleed-
ing can be given protamine sulfate to neutralize the heparin. Protamine 
sulfate,  a  mixture  of  basic  polypeptides  isolated  from  salmon  sperm, 
binds heparin with high affinity, and the resultant protamine-heparin 
complexes are then cleared. Typically, 1 mg of protamine sulfate neutral-
izes 100 units of heparin. Protamine sulfate is given IV. Anaphylactoid 
reactions  to  protamine  sulfate  can  occur,  and  drug  administration  by 
slow IV infusion is recommended to reduce the risk.
Thrombocytopenia  Heparin  can  cause  thrombocytopenia.  Heparin- 
induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated process that 
is triggered by antibodies directed against neoantigens on PF4 that are 
exposed when heparin binds to this protein. These antibodies, which 
are usually of the IgG isotype, bind simultaneously to the heparin-PF4 
complex and to platelet Fc receptors. Such binding activates the plate-
lets  and  generates  platelet  microparticles.  Circulating  microparticles 
are prothrombotic because they express anionic phospholipids on their 
surface and can bind clotting factors and promote thrombin generation.
The clinical features of HIT are illustrated in Table 118-3. Typically, 
HIT  occurs  5–14  days  after  initiation  of  heparin  therapy,  but  it  can 
manifest  earlier  if  the  patient  has  received  heparin  within  the  past  
3  months.  A  platelet  count  <100,000/μL  or  a  50%  decrease  in  the 
platelet count from the pretreatment value should raise the suspicion 
of  HIT.  HIT  is  more  common  in  surgical  patients  than  in  medical 
patients and, like many autoimmune disorders, occurs more frequently 
in females than in males.

HIT  can  be  associated  with  thrombosis,  either  arterial  or  venous. 
Venous  thrombosis,  which  manifests  as  DVT  and/or  PE,  is  more

or rivaroxaban.
Do not give platelet transfusions.

common than arterial thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis can manifest as 
ischemic stroke or acute MI. Rarely, platelet-rich thrombi in the distal 
aorta or iliac arteries can cause critical limb ischemia.

The  diagnosis  of  HIT  is  established  using  enzyme-linked  assays  to 
detect antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes or with platelet activa-
tion assays. Enzyme-linked assays are sensitive but can be positive in the 
absence of any clinical evidence of HIT. The most specific diagnostic test 
for HIT is the serotonin release assay. This test is performed by quantify-
ing serotonin release when washed platelets loaded with labeled seroto-
nin are exposed to patient serum in the absence or presence of varying 
concentrations of heparin. If the patient serum contains the HIT anti-
body, heparin addition induces platelet activation and serotonin release.
Management  of  HIT  is  outlined  in  Table  118-4.  Heparin  should 
be  stopped  in  patients  with  suspected  or  documented  HIT,  and  an 
alternative  anticoagulant  should  be  administered  to  prevent  or  treat 
thrombosis. The agents most often used for this indication are paren-
teral direct thrombin inhibitors, such as argatroban or bivalirudin, or 
factor Xa inhibitors, such as fondaparinux or rivaroxaban. A HIT-like 
syndrome  known  as  vaccine  induced  thrombotic  thrombocytopenia 
is  a  rare  complication  after  vaccination  with    adenovirus  COVID-19 
vaccines.  Characterized  by  thrombosis  and  thrombocytopenia  that 
occur 4 to 28 days after vaccination, patients can present with cerebral 
or splanchnic vein thrombosis as well as DVT or PE. The diagnosis is 
established by evidence of antibodies against PF4 and a positive sero-
tonin release assay with added PF4. Treatment can include intravenous  
immunoglobulin,  steroids,  and  plasma  exchange  to  offset  the  effects 
of  the  antibodies  against  PF4  and  anticoagulants  such  as  argatroban, 
fondaprinux or rivaroxaban to treat the thrombosis.

Patients  with  HIT,  particularly  those  with  associated  thrombosis, 
often have evidence of increased thrombin generation that can lead to 
consumption of protein C. If these patients are given warfarin without 
a concomitant anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin or thrombin gen-
eration, the further decrease in protein C levels induced by the vitamin 
K antagonist can trigger skin necrosis. To avoid this problem, patients 
with HIT should be treated with a direct thrombin inhibitor or with 
fondaparinux until the platelet count returns to normal levels. At this 
point, low-dose warfarin therapy can be introduced, and the parenteral 
anticoagulant can be discontinued when the international normalized 
ratio  (INR)  has  been  therapeutic  for  at  least  2  days.  Alternatively,  a 
direct oral anticoagulant can be given.
Osteoporosis  Treatment  with  therapeutic  doses  of  heparin  for  >1 
month  can  cause  a  reduction  in  bone  density.  This  complication 
has  been  reported  in  up  to  30%  of  patients  given  long-term  heparin 
therapy,  and  symptomatic  vertebral  fractures  occur  in  2–3%  of  these 
individuals.

Heparin causes bone loss both by decreasing bone formation and by 
enhancing bone resorption. Thus, heparin affects the activity of both 
osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Elevated  Levels  of  Transaminases  Therapeutic  doses  of  heparin  are  fre-
quently  associated  with  modest  elevations  in  the  serum  levels  of 
hepatic transaminases without a concomitant increase in the level of 
bilirubin. The levels of transaminases rapidly return to normal when 
the drug is stopped. The mechanism responsible for this phenomenon 
is unknown.

ments of heparin, LMWH is prepared from unfractionated heparin by

controlled enzymatic or chemical depolymerization. The mean molec-
ular  weight  of  LMWH  is  about  5000,  one-third  the  mean  molecular 
weight of unfractionated heparin. LMWH has advantages over heparin 
(Table 118-5) and has replaced heparin for most indications.
MECHANISM OF ACTION  Like heparin, LMWH exerts its anticoagu-
lant activity by activating antithrombin. With a mean molecular weight 
of 5000, which corresponds to about 17 saccharide units, at least half 
of  the  pentasaccharide-containing  chains  of  LMWH  are  too  short  to 
bridge thrombin to antithrombin (Fig. 118-5). However, these chains 
retain the capacity to accelerate factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin 
because this activity is largely the result of the conformational changes 
in  antithrombin  evoked  by  pentasaccharide  binding.  Consequently, 
LMWH  catalyzes  factor  Xa  inhibition  by  antithrombin  more  than 
thrombin  inhibition.  Depending  on  their  unique  molecular  weight 
distributions, LMWH preparations have anti–factor Xa to anti–factor 
IIa ratios ranging from 2:1 to 4:1.
PHARMACOLOGY  Although  usually  given  SC,  LMWH  also  can  be 
administered IV if a rapid anticoagulant response is needed. LMWH 
has pharmacokinetic advantages over heparin. These advantages reflect 
the fact that shorter heparin chains bind less avidly to endothelial cells, 
macrophages, and heparin-binding plasma proteins. Reduced binding 
to endothelial cells and macrophages eliminates the rapid, dose-dependent, 
and saturable mechanism of clearance that is a characteristic of unfrac-
tionated heparin. Instead, the clearance of LMWH is dose-independent 
and its plasma half-life is longer. Based on measurement of anti–factor 
Xa  levels,  LMWH  has  a  plasma  half-life  of  ~4  h.  LMWH  is  cleared 
almost  exclusively  by  the  kidneys,  and  the  drug  can  accumulate  in 
patients with renal insufficiency.

LMWH  exhibits  about  90%  bioavailability  after  SC  injection. 
Because  LMWH  binds  less  avidly  to  heparin-binding  proteins  in 
plasma  than  heparin,  LMWH  produces  a  more  predictable  dose 
response, and resistance to LMWH is rare. With a longer half-life and 
more predictable anticoagulant response, LMWH can be given SC once 
or twice daily without coagulation monitoring, even when the drug is 
given in treatment doses. These properties render LMWH more conve-
nient than unfractionated heparin. Capitalizing on this feature, studies 
in  patients  with  venous  thromboembolism  have  shown  that  home 
treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as in-hospital treatment 
with  continuous  IV  infusions  of  heparin.  Outpatient  treatment  with 
LMWH  streamlines  care,  reduces  health  care  costs,  and  increases 
patient satisfaction.
MONITORING  In  the  majority  of  patients,  LMWH  does  not  require 
coagulation  monitoring.  If  monitoring  is  necessary,  anti–factor  Xa 
levels must be measured because most LMWH preparations have little 
effect  on  the  aPTT.  Therapeutic  anti-factor  Xa  levels  once  daily  and 
twice daily doses of LMWH range from 0.5 to 1.2 units/mL and 1.0 to 
2.0 units/mL, respectively, when measured 3–4 h after drug adminis-
tration. When LMWH is given in prophylactic doses, peak anti–factor 
Xa levels of 0.2–0.5 units/mL are desirable.

Indications  for  LMWH  monitoring  include  renal  impairment  and 
obesity. LMWH monitoring in patients with a creatinine clearance of 
≤30 mL/min is advisable to ensure that there is no drug accumulation.

932 Although  weight-adjusted  LMWH  dosing  appears  to  produce  ther-
apeutic  anti–factor  Xa  levels  in  patients  who  are  overweight,  this 
approach  has  not  been  extensively  evaluated  in  those  with  morbid 
obesity. It may also be advisable to monitor the anticoagulant activity 
of LMWH during pregnancy because dose requirements can change, 
particularly in the third trimester. Monitoring should also be consid-
ered in high-risk settings, such as in pregnant women with mechanical 
heart valves who are given LMWH for prevention of valve thrombosis, 
and when LMWH is used in treatment doses in infants or children.
DOSING  The doses of LMWH recommended for prophylaxis or treat-
ment  vary  depending  on  the  LMWH  preparation.  For  prophylaxis, 
once-daily SC doses of 4000–5000 units are often used, whereas doses 
of 2500–3000 units are given when the drug is administered twice daily. 
For treatment of venous thromboembolism, a dose of 150–200 units/kg 
is given if the drug is administered once daily. If a twice-daily regimen 
is used, a dose of 100 units/kg is given. In patients with unstable angina, 
LMWH is given SC on a twice-daily basis at a dose of 100–120 units/kg.
SIDE  EFFECTS  The  major  complication  of  LMWH  is  bleeding. 
Meta-analyses  suggest  that  the  risk  of  major  bleeding  is  lower  with 
LMWH than with unfractionated heparin. HIT and osteoporosis are 
less common with LMWH than with unfractionated heparin.
Bleeding  Like  the  situation  with  heparin,  bleeding  with  LMWH  is 
more  common  in  patients  receiving  concomitant  therapy  with  anti-
platelet  or  fibrinolytic  drugs.  Recent  surgery,  trauma,  or  underlying 
hemostatic defects also increase the risk of bleeding with LMWH.

Although protamine sulfate can be used as an antidote for LMWH, 
protamine  sulfate  incompletely  neutralizes  the  anticoagulant  activity 
of LMWH because it only binds the longer chains of LMWH. Because 
longer  chains  are  responsible  for  catalysis  of  thrombin  inhibition  by 
antithrombin,  protamine  sulfate  completely  reverses  the  anti–factor 
IIa  activity  of  LMWH.  In  contrast,  protamine  sulfate  only  partially 
reverses  the  anti–factor  Xa  activity  of  LMWH  because  the  shorter  
pentasaccharide-containing  chains  of  LMWH  do  not  bind  to  prota-
mine sulfate. Consequently, patients at high risk for bleeding may be 
more  safely  treated  with  continuous  IV  unfractionated  heparin  than 
with SC LMWH.
Thrombocytopenia  The risk of HIT is about fivefold lower with LMWH 
than with heparin. LMWH binds less avidly to platelets and causes less 
PF4  release.  Furthermore,  with  lower  affinity  for  PF4  than  heparin, 
LMWH is less likely to induce the conformational changes in PF4 that 
trigger the formation of HIT antibodies.

LMWH should not be used to treat HIT patients because most HIT 
antibodies  exhibit  cross-reactivity  with  LMWH.  This  in  vitro  cross- 
reactivity  is  not  simply  a  laboratory  phenomenon  because  there  are 
case  reports  of  thrombosis  when  HIT  patients  were  switched  from 
heparin to LMWH.
Osteoporosis  Because  the  risk  of  osteoporosis  is  lower  with  LMWH 
than with heparin, LMWH is a better choice for extended treatment.

pentasaccharide sequence, fondaparinux differs from LMWH in several

this indication in the United States.

MECHANISM OF ACTION  As a synthetic analogue of the antithrombin- 
binding  pentasaccharide  sequence  found  in  heparin  and  LMWH, 
fondaparinux  has  a  molecular  weight  of  1728.  Fondaparinux  binds 
only to antithrombin (Fig. 118-5) and is too short to bridge thrombin 
to  antithrombin.  Consequently,  fondaparinux  catalyzes  factor  Xa 
inhibition by antithrombin and does not enhance the rate of thrombin 
inhibition.

PHARMACOLOGY  Fondaparinux  exhibits  complete  bioavailability 
after  SC  injection.  With  no  binding  to  endothelial  cells  or  plasma 
proteins,  the  clearance  of  fondaparinux  is  dose  independent,  and 
its plasma half-life is 17 h. The drug is given SC once daily. Because 
fondaparinux  is  cleared  unchanged  via  the  kidneys,  it  is  contraindi-
cated in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min and should 
be used with caution in those with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.

Dosing  Fondaparinux  produces  a  predictable  anticoagulant 
response after administration in fixed doses because it does not bind 
to plasma proteins. The drug is given at a dose of 2.5 mg once daily 
for  prevention  of  venous  thromboembolism.  For  initial  treatment  of 
established venous thromboembolism, fondaparinux is given at a dose 
of 7.5 mg once daily. The dose can be reduced to 5 mg once daily for 
those weighing <50 kg and increased to 10 mg for those >100 kg. When 
given in these doses, fondaparinux is as effective as heparin or LMWH 
for initial treatment of patients with DVT or PE and produces similar 
rates of bleeding.

Fondaparinux is used at a dose of 2.5 mg once daily in patients with 
acute coronary syndrome. When this prophylactic dose of fondapari-
nux was compared with treatment doses of enoxaparin in patients with 
non-ST-segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome,  there  was  no 
difference in the rate of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke at 9 days. 
However, the rate of major bleeding was 50% lower with fondaparinux 
than with enoxaparin, a difference that likely reflects the fact that the 
dose  of  fondaparinux  was  lower  than  that  of  enoxaparin.  In  acute 
coronary syndrome patients who require percutaneous coronary inter-
vention, there is a risk of catheter thrombosis with fondaparinux unless 
adjunctive heparin is given at the time of the procedure.

SIDE  EFFECTS  Fondaparinux  does  not  cause  HIT  because  it  does 
not  bind  to  PF4.  In  contrast  to  LMWH,  there  is  no  cross-reactivity 
of  fondaparinux  with  HIT  antibodies.  Consequently,  fondaparinux 
appears  to  be  effective  for  treatment  of  HIT  patients,  although  large 
clinical trials supporting its use are lacking.

The major side effect of fondaparinux is bleeding. Fondaparinux has 
no antidote. Protamine sulfate has no effect on the anticoagulant activ-
ity of fondaparinux because it fails to bind to the drug. Recombinant 
activated factor VII reverses the anticoagulant effects of fondaparinux 
in volunteers, but it is unknown whether this agent controls fondaparinux- 
induced bleeding.

Parenteral  Direct  Thrombin  Inhibitors  Direct  thrombin 
inhibitors bind directly to thrombin and block its interaction with its 
substrates.  Approved  parenteral  direct  thrombin  inhibitors  include 
recombinant  hirudins  (lepirudin  and  desirudin),  argatroban,  and 
bivalirudin (Table 118-7). Lepirudin and desirudin are no longer avail-
able. Argatroban is licensed for treatment of patients with HIT, and biv-
alirudin is approved as an alternative to heparin in patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention, including those with HIT.

ARGATROBAN  A  univalent  inhibitor  that  targets  the  active  site  of 
thrombin,  argatroban  is  metabolized  in  the  liver.  Consequently,  this 
drug must be used with caution in patients with hepatic insufficiency. 
Argatroban  is  not  cleared  via  the  kidneys,  so  this  drug  is  safer  than 
fondaparinux for HIT patients with renal impairment.

Argatroban  is  administered  by  continuous  IV  infusion  and  has  a 
plasma half-life of ~45 min. The aPTT is used to monitor its anticoag-
ulant effect, and the dose is adjusted to achieve an aPTT 1.5–3 times 
the baseline value, but not to exceed 100 s. Argatroban also prolongs 
the INR, a feature that can complicate the transitioning of patients to 
warfarin. This problem can be circumvented by using the levels of fac-
tor X to monitor warfarin instead of the INR. Alternatively, argatroban 
can be stopped for 2–3 h before INR determination.
BIVALIRUDIN  A  synthetic  20-amino-acid  analogue  of  hirudin,  biv-
alirudin  is  a  divalent  thrombin  inhibitor.  Thus,  the  N-terminus  of 
bivalirudin  interacts  with  the  active  site  of  thrombin,  whereas  its 
C-terminus  binds  to  exosite  1.  Bivalirudin  has  a  plasma  half-life  of  
25  min,  the  shortest  half-life  of  all  the  parenteral  direct  thrombin 
inhibitors.  Bivalirudin  is  degraded  by  peptidases  and  is  partially 
excreted  via  the  kidneys.  When  given  in  high  doses  in  the  cardiac 
catheterization  laboratory,  the  anticoagulant  activity  of  bivalirudin 
is  monitored  using  the  activated  clotting  time.  With  lower  doses,  its 
activity can be assessed using the aPTT.

Bivalirudin is licensed as an alternative to heparin in patients under-
going  percutaneous  coronary  intervention.  Bivalirudin  also  has  been 
used successfully in HIT patients who require percutaneous coronary 
intervention or cardiac bypass surgery.
 ■ ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS
For many years, vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin were the only 
available  oral  anticoagulants.  This  situation  changed  with  the  intro-
duction  of  the  direct  oral  anticoagulants,  which  include  dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

Warfarin  A water-soluble vitamin K antagonist initially developed 
as a rodenticide, warfarin is the coumarin derivative most often pre-
scribed in North America. Like other vitamin K antagonists, warfarin 
interferes with the synthesis of the vitamin K–dependent clotting pro-
teins, which include prothrombin (factor II) and factors VII, IX, and 
X. The synthesis of the vitamin K–dependent anticoagulant proteins, 
proteins C and S, is also reduced by vitamin K antagonists.
MECHANISM  OF  ACTION  All  of  the  vitamin  K–dependent  clotting 
factors possess glutamic acid residues at their N termini. A posttransla-
tional modification adds a carboxyl group to the γ-carbon of these resi-
dues to generate γ-carboxyglutamic acid. This modification is essential 
for expression of the activity of these clotting factors because it permits 
their  calcium-dependent  binding  to  negatively  charged  phospholipid 
surfaces.  The  γ-carboxylation  process  is  catalyzed  by  a  vitamin  K–
dependent  carboxylase.  Thus,  vitamin  K  from  the  diet  is  reduced  to 
vitamin  K  hydroquinone  by  vitamin  K  reductase  (Fig.  118-6).  Vita-
min K hydroquinone serves as a cofactor for the carboxylase enzyme, 
which in the presence of carbon dioxide replaces the hydrogen on the 
γ-carbon of glutamic acid residues with a carboxyl group. During this 
process,  vitamin  K  hydroquinone  is  oxidized  to  vitamin  K  epoxide, 
which is then reduced to vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.

Warfarin  inhibits  vitamin  K  epoxide  reductase  (VKOR),  thereby 
blocking  the  γ-carboxylation  process.  This  results  in  the  synthesis 
of  vitamin  K–dependent  clotting  proteins  that  are  only  partially  γ- 
carboxylated.  Warfarin  acts  as  an  anticoagulant  because  these

FIGURE  118-6  Mechanism  of  action  of  warfarin.  A  racemic  mixture  of  S-  and 
R-enantiomers, S-warfarin is most active. By blocking vitamin K epoxide reductase, 
warfarin  inhibits  the  conversion  of  oxidized  vitamin  K  into  its  reduced  form.  This 
inhibits vitamin K–dependent γ-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X because 
reduced vitamin K serves as a cofactor for a γ-glutamyl carboxylase that catalyzes 
the γ-carboxylation process, thereby converting prozymogens to zymogens capable 
of binding calcium and interacting with anionic phospholipid surfaces. S-warfarin 
is  metabolized  by  CYP2C9.  Common  genetic  polymorphisms  in  this  enzyme  can 
influence  warfarin  metabolism.  Polymorphisms  in  the  C1  subunit  of  vitamin  K 
reductase (VKORC1) also can affect the susceptibility of the enzyme to warfarin-
induced inhibition, thereby influencing warfarin dosage requirements.

partially γ-carboxylated proteins have little or no biological activity. 
The onset of action of warfarin is delayed until the newly synthesized 
clotting  factors  with  reduced  activity  gradually  replace  their  fully 
active counterparts.

The  antithrombotic  effect  of  warfarin  depends  on  a  reduction  in 
the functional levels of factor X and prothrombin, clotting factors that 
have half-lives of 24 and 72 h, respectively. Because the antithrombotic 
effect  of  warfarin  is  delayed,  patients  with  established  thrombosis 
or  at  high  risk  for  thrombosis  require  concomitant  treatment  with  a 
rapidly  acting  parenteral  anticoagulant,  such  as  heparin,  LMWH,  or 
fondaparinux, for at least 5 days.
PHARMACOLOGY  Warfarin is a racemic mixture of R and S isomers. 
Warfarin is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastroin-
testinal tract. Levels of warfarin in the blood peak about 90 min after 
drug administration. Racemic warfarin has a plasma half-life of 36–42 h, 
and >97% of circulating warfarin is bound to albumin. Only the small 
fraction of unbound warfarin is biologically active.

Warfarin accumulates in the liver where the two isomers are metab-
olized via distinct pathways. CYP2C9 mediates oxidative metabolism of 
the more active S isomer (Fig. 118-6). Two relatively common variants, 
CYP2C9*2  and  CYP2C9*3,  encode  an  enzyme  with  reduced  activity. 
Patients with these variants require lower maintenance doses of war-
farin. Approximately 25% of Caucasians have at least one variant allele 
of CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3, whereas those variant alleles are less com-
mon in African Americans and Asians (Table 118-8). Heterozygosity 
for CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 decreases the warfarin dose requirement 
by  20–30%  relative  to  that  required  in  subjects  with  the  wild-type 
CYP2C9*1/*1  alleles,  whereas  homozygosity  for  the  CYP2C9*2  or 
CYP2C9*3 alleles reduces the warfarin dose requirement by 50–70%.

Consistent  with  their  decreased  warfarin  dose  requirement,  sub-
jects with at least one CYP2C9 variant allele are at increased risk for 
bleeding. Compared with individuals with no variant alleles, the risk 
of  warfarin-associated  bleeding  is  almost  2-fold  higher  in  CYP2C9*2 
or CYP2C9*3 carriers.

Polymorphisms  in  VKORC1  also  can  influence  the  anticoagulant 
response  to  warfarin.  Several  genetic  variations  of  VKORC1  are  in 
strong linkage disequilibrium and have been designated as non-A hap-
lotypes. VKORC1 variants are more prevalent than variants of CYP2C9. 
Asians have the highest prevalence of VKORC1 variants, followed by 
Caucasians  and  African  Americans  (Table  118-8).  Polymorphisms 
in  VKORC1  likely  explain  30%  of  the  variability  in  warfarin  dose 
requirements.  Compared  with  VKORC1  non-A/non-A  homozygotes, 
the  warfarin  dose  requirement  decreases  by  25  and  50%  in  A  hap-
lotype  heterozygotes  and  homozygotes,  respectively.  These  findings 
prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to amend the 
prescribing  information  for  warfarin  to  indicate  that  lower  initiation 
doses  should  be  considered  for  patients  with  CYP2C9  and  VKORC1 
genetic variants. In addition to genotype data, other pertinent patient 
information  has  been  incorporated  into  warfarin  dosing  algorithms. 
Although  such  algorithms  help  predict  suitable  warfarin  doses,  it 
remains  unclear  whether  better  dose  identification  improves  patient 
outcome in terms of reducing hemorrhagic complications or recurrent 
thrombotic events.

In  addition  to  genetic  factors,  the  anticoagulant  effect  of  warfarin 
is influenced by diet, drugs, and various disease states. Fluctuations in 
dietary vitamin K intake affect the activity of warfarin. A wide variety 
of  drugs  can  alter  absorption,  clearance,  or  metabolism  of  warfarin. 
Because  of  the  variability  in  the  anticoagulant  response  to  warfa-
rin,  coagulation  monitoring  is  essential  to  ensure  that  a  therapeutic 
response is obtained.
MONITORING  Warfarin  therapy  is  most  often  monitored  using  the 
prothrombin time, a test that is sensitive to reductions in the levels of 
prothrombin, factor VII, and factor X. The test is performed by adding 
thromboplastin, a reagent that contains tissue factor, phospholipid, and 
calcium, to citrated plasma and determining the time to clot formation. 
Thromboplastins vary in their sensitivity to reductions in the levels of 
the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. Thus, less sensitive throm-
boplastins will trigger the administration of higher doses of warfarin to 
achieve a target prothrombin time. This is problematic because higher 
doses of warfarin increase the risk of bleeding.

The INR was developed to circumvent many of the problems asso-
ciated with the prothrombin time. To calculate the INR, the patient’s 
prothrombin time is divided by the mean normal prothrombin time, 
and this ratio is then multiplied by the international sensitivity index 
(ISI), which is an index of the sensitivity of the thromboplastin used 
for prothrombin time determination to reductions in the levels of the 
vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. Sensitive thromboplastins have 
an  ISI  near  1.0.  Most  current  thromboplastins  have  ISI  values  that 
range from 0.9 to 1.4.

Although the INR has helped to standardize anticoagulant practice, 
problems persist. The precision of INR determination varies depend-
ing  on  reagent-coagulometer  combinations.  This  leads  to  variability 
in the INR results. Also complicating INR determination is unreliable 
reporting  of  the  ISI  by  thromboplastin  manufacturers.  Furthermore, 
every  laboratory  must  establish  the  mean  normal  prothrombin  time 
with  each  new  batch  of  thromboplastin  reagent.  To  accomplish  this, 
the prothrombin time must be measured in fresh plasma samples from 
at least 20 healthy volunteers using the same coagulometer that is used 
for patient samples.

For most indications, warfarin is administered in doses that produce 
a target INR of 2.0–3.0. An exception is patients with mechanical heart 
valves, particularly those in the mitral position or older ball and cage 
valves in the aortic position, where a target INR of 2.5–3.5 is recom-
mended. Studies in atrial fibrillation demonstrate an increased risk of 
cardioembolic stroke when the INR falls below 1.7 and an increase in 
bleeding with INR values >4.5. These findings highlight the fact that 
vitamin K antagonists have a narrow therapeutic window. In support of 
this concept, a study in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy 
for unprovoked venous thromboembolism demonstrated a higher rate 
of  recurrent  venous  thromboembolism  with  a  target  INR  of  1.5–1.9 
compared with a target INR of 2.0–3.0.
DOSING  Warfarin is usually started at a dose of 5–10 mg. Lower doses 
are used for patients with CYP2C9 or VKORC1 polymorphisms, which 
affect  the  pharmacodynamics  or  pharmacokinetics  of  warfarin  and 
render patients more sensitive to the drug. The dose is then titrated to 
achieve the desired target INR. Because of its delayed onset of action, 
patients with established thrombosis or those at high risk for throm-
bosis  are  given  concomitant  initial  treatment  with  a  rapidly  acting 
parenteral  anticoagulant,  such  as  heparin,  LMWH,  or  fondaparinux. 
Early prolongation of the INR reflects reduction in the functional levels 
of factor VII. Consequently, concomitant treatment with the parenteral 
anticoagulant should be continued until the INR has been therapeutic 
for at least 2 consecutive days. A minimum 5-day course of parenteral 
anticoagulation is recommended to ensure that the levels of factor Xa 
and  prothrombin  have  been  reduced  into  the  therapeutic  range  with 
warfarin.

Because  warfarin  has  a  narrow  therapeutic  window,  frequent 
coagulation monitoring is essential to ensure that a therapeutic anti-
coagulant  response  is  maintained.  Even  patients  with  stable  warfarin 
dose requirements should have their INR determined every 3–4 weeks 
although there are studies suggesting that less frequent monitoring is 
feasible. More frequent monitoring is necessary when new medications 
are introduced because so many drugs enhance or reduce the anticoag-
ulant effects of warfarin.
SIDE EFFECTS  Like all anticoagulants, the major side effect of warfa-
rin is bleeding. A rare complication is skin necrosis. Warfarin crosses 
the placenta and can cause fetal abnormalities. Consequently, warfarin 
should not be used during pregnancy.
Bleeding  At  least  half  of  the  bleeding  complications  with  warfarin 
occur when the INR exceeds the therapeutic range. Bleeding compli-
cations may be mild, such as epistaxis or hematuria, or more severe, 
such  as  retroperitoneal  or  gastrointestinal  bleeding.  Life-threatening 
intracranial bleeding can also occur.

To minimize the risk of bleeding, the INR should be maintained 
in  the  therapeutic  range.  In  asymptomatic  patients  whose  INR  is 
between  3.5  and  10,  warfarin  should  be  withheld  until  the  INR 
returns to the therapeutic range. If the INR is over 10, oral vitamin 
K  can  be  administered  at  a  dose  of  2.5–5  mg,  although  there  is  no 
evidence  that  doing  so  reduces  the  bleeding  risk.  Higher  doses  of 
oral  vitamin  K  (5–10  mg)  produce  more  rapid  reversal  of  the  INR 
but  may render patients temporarily resistant to  warfarin when  the 
drug is restarted.

Patients  with  serious  bleeding  need  more  aggressive  treatment. 
These  patients  should  be  given  5–10  mg  of  vitamin  K  by  slow  IV 
infusion.  Additional  vitamin  K  should  be  given  until  the  INR  is  in 
the normal range. Treatment with vitamin K should be supplemented 
with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, which contains all

four  vitamin  K–dependent  clotting  proteins.  Prothrombin  complex 
concentrate normalizes the INR more rapidly than transfusion of fresh 
frozen plasma.

Warfarin-treated patients who experience bleeding when their INR 
is in the therapeutic range require investigation into the cause of the 
bleeding. Those with gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding often 
have an underlying lesion.
Skin Necrosis  A rare complication of warfarin, skin necrosis usually is 
seen 2–5 days after initiation of therapy. Well-demarcated erythema-
tous  lesions  form  on  the  thighs,  buttocks,  breasts,  or  toes.  Typically, 
the center of the lesion becomes progressively necrotic. Examination 
of skin biopsies taken from the border of these lesions reveals thrombi 
in the microvasculature.

Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is seen in patients with congen-
ital  or  acquired  deficiencies  of  protein  C  or  protein  S.  Initiation 
of warfarin therapy in these patients produces a precipitous fall in 
plasma levels of proteins C or S, thereby eliminating this important 
anticoagulant  pathway  before  warfarin  exerts  an  antithrombotic 
effect  through  lowering  of  the  functional  levels  of  factor  X  and 
prothrombin. The resultant procoagulant state triggers thrombosis. 
Why  the  thrombosis  is  localized  to  the  microvasculature  of  fatty 
tissues is unclear.

Treatment  involves  discontinuation  of  warfarin  and  reversal  with 
vitamin  K,  if  needed.  An  alternative  anticoagulant,  such  as  heparin 
or  LMWH,  should  be  given  in  patients  with  thrombosis.  Protein  C 
concentrate can be given to protein C–deficient patients to accelerate 
healing  of  the  skin  lesions;  fresh-frozen  plasma  may  be  of  value  if 
protein C concentrate is unavailable and for those with protein S defi-
ciency. Occasionally, skin grafting is necessary when there is extensive 
skin loss.

Because  of  the  potential  for  skin  necrosis,  patients  with  known 
protein  C  or  protein  S  deficiency  require  overlapping  treatment  with 
a  parenteral  anticoagulant  when  initiating  warfarin  therapy.  Warfarin 
should be started in low doses in these patients, and the parenteral anti-
coagulant should be continued until the INR is therapeutic for at least 
2–3 consecutive days. Alternatively, treatment with rivaroxaban or apix-
aban could be given, although there is limited information about their 
efficacy and safety in patients with severe protein C or S deficiency.
Pregnancy  Warfarin  crosses  the  placenta  and  can  cause  fetal  abnor-
malities or bleeding. The fetal abnormalities include a characteristic 
embryopathy, which consists of nasal hypoplasia and stippled epiphy-
ses. The risk of embryopathy is highest if warfarin is given in the first 
trimester  of  pregnancy.  Central  nervous  system  abnormalities  can 
also occur with exposure to warfarin at any time during pregnancy. 
Finally, maternal administration of warfarin produces an anticoagu-
lant effect in the fetus that can cause bleeding. This is of particular 
concern at delivery when trauma to the head during passage through 
the  birth  canal  can  lead  to  intracranial  bleeding.  Because  of  these 
potential  problems,  warfarin  is  contraindicated  in  pregnancy,  par-
ticularly in the first and third trimesters. Instead, heparin, LMWH, 
or  fondaparinux  can  be  given  during  pregnancy  for  prevention  or 
treatment of thrombosis.

Warfarin does not pass into the breast milk. Consequently, warfarin 

can safely be given to nursing mothers.

Special  Problems  Patients  with  a  lupus  anticoagulant  and  those  who 
need  urgent  or  elective  surgery  present  special  challenges.  Although 
observational  studies  suggested  that  patients  with  thrombosis  com-
plicating  the  antiphospholipid  antibody  syndrome  required  higher 
intensity  warfarin  regimens  to  prevent  recurrent  thromboembolic 
events, two randomized trials showed that targeting an INR of 2.0–3.0 
is as effective as higher intensity treatment and produces less bleeding. 
Monitoring warfarin therapy can be problematic in patients with anti-
phospholipid  antibody  syndrome  if  the  lupus  anticoagulant  prolongs 
the baseline INR; factor X levels can be used instead of the INR in such 
patients.

There is no need to stop warfarin before procedures associated with 
a  low  risk  of  bleeding;  these  include  dental  cleaning,  simple  dental 
extraction, cataract surgery, or skin biopsy. For procedures associated 
with a moderate or high risk of bleeding, warfarin should be stopped  
5 days before the procedure to allow the INR to return to normal levels. 
Patients  at  high  risk  for  thrombosis,  such  as  those  with  mechanical 
heart valves, can be bridged with once- or twice-daily SC injections of 
LMWH when the INR falls to <2.0. The last dose of LMWH should be 
given 12–24 h before the procedure, depending on whether LMWH is 
administered twice or once daily. After the procedure, treatment with 
warfarin can be restarted.

Direct  Oral  Anticoagulants  The  direct  oral  anticoagulants 
(DOACs)  include  dabigatran,  which  inhibits  thrombin,  and  rivarox-
aban,  apixaban,  and  edoxaban,  which  inhibit  factor  Xa.  These  drugs 
have a rapid onset and offset of action and have half-lives that permit 
once- or twice-daily administration. Designed to produce a predictable 
level of anticoagulation, the DOACs are more convenient to administer 
than  warfarin  because  they  are  given  in  fixed  doses  without  routine 
coagulation monitoring.

MECHANISM OF ACTION  The DOACs are small molecules that bind

rizes the distinct pharmacologic properties of these agents.

INDICATIONS  All  four  DOACs  are  licensed  for  stroke  prevention 
in  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation,  which  encompasses 
patients  without  mechanical  heart  valves  or  severe  rheumatic  mitral 
valve disease, and for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). 
Dabigatran,  rivaroxaban,  and  apixaban  are  licensed  for  thrombo-
prophylaxis  after  elective  hip  or  knee  arthroplasty;  edoxaban  is  only 
licensed for this indication in Japan. Finally, low-dose rivaroxaban is 
licensed for use with aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with 
coronary or peripheral artery disease.

DOSING  For prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation, rivaroxaban is given at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, with a 
reduction to 15 mg once daily in patients with a creatinine clearance of 
15–49 mL/min; dabigatran is given at a dosage of 150 mg twice daily, with 
a reduction to 75 mg twice daily in those with a creatinine clearance of 
15–30 mL/min; apixaban is given at a dosage of 5 mg twice daily, with 
a reduction to 2.5 mg twice daily for patients with at least two of the 
“ABC” criteria (i.e., age >80 years, body weight <60 kg, and creatinine 
>1.5  g/dL);  and  edoxaban  is  given  at  a  dosage  of  60  mg  once  daily 
for patients with a creatinine clearance of 50–95 mL/min and with a

reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with any one of the following 
criteria: creatinine clearance of 15–50 mL/min, body weight of 60 kg 
or  less,  or  use  of  potent  P-glycoprotein  inhibitors,  such  as  verapamil 
or quinidine. At doses of 15 or 20 mg once daily, rivaroxaban must be 
administered  with  food  to  enhance  absorption.  Apixaban  and  edox-
aban can be given with or without food. Administration of dabigatran 
with food may reduce dyspepsia.

For  treatment  of  VTE,  dabigatran  and  edoxaban  are  started  after 
patients have received at least a 5-day course of treatment with a parent-
eral anticoagulant such as LMWH; dabigatran is given at a dose of 150 mg  
twice daily provided the creatinine clearance is >30 mL/min, and the 
dosage regimen for edoxaban is identical to that used in patients with 
atrial fibrillation. In contrast, rivaroxaban and apixaban can be given in 
all-oral regimens; rivaroxaban is started at a dose of 15 mg twice daily 
for 21 days and is then reduced to 20 mg once daily thereafter, whereas 
apixaban is started at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days and is then 
reduced to 5 mg twice daily thereafter. For secondary VTE prevention, 
the dosage of apixaban can be lowered to 2.5 mg twice daily while the 
dose of rivaroxaban can be lowered to 10 mg once daily, doses that have 
safety profiles like those of placebo and aspirin, respectively.

Thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee replacement surgery is 
started after surgery and is often continued for 30 days in patients under-
going  hip  replacement  and  for  10–14  days  in  patients  undergoing  knee 
replacement. Dabigatran is given at a dose of 220 mg once daily, whereas 
rivaroxaban and apixaban are given at doses of 10 mg once daily and 2.5 mg  
twice  daily,  respectively.  In  lower  risk  patients  undergoing  hip  or  knee 
replacement surgery, a 5-day course of rivaroxaban followed by a 30-day 
course of aspirin at a dose of 81 mg daily appears to be as effective and safe 
as extended thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban.

For  secondary  prevention  of  adverse  cardiac  or  limb  events  in 
patients  with  coronary  or  peripheral  artery  disease,  rivaroxaban  is 
given at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily on top of aspirin (81 or 100 mg 
once daily).

MONITORING  Although  designed  to  be  administered  without  rou-
tine  monitoring,  there  are  situations  where  determination  of  the 
anticoagulant activity of the new oral anticoagulants can be helpful. 
These include assessment of adherence, detection of accumulation or 
overdose, identification of bleeding mechanisms, and determination 
of  activity  prior  to  surgery,  intervention,  or  reversal.  For  qualitative 
assessment  of  anticoagulant  activity,  the  prothrombin  time  can  be 
used  for  factor  Xa  inhibitors  and  the  aPTT  for  dabigatran.  Riva-
roxaban  and  edoxaban  prolong  the  prothrombin  time  more  than 
apixaban.  In  fact,  because  apixaban  has  such  a  limited  effect  on  the 
prothrombin time, anti–factor Xa assays are needed to assess its activ-
ity. The effect of the drugs on tests of coagulation varies depending on 
the time that the blood is drawn relative to the timing of the last dose 
of the drug and the reagents used to perform the tests. Chromogenic 
anti–factor Xa assays and the diluted thrombin clotting time or ecarin 
clot  time  with  appropriate  calibrators  provide  quantitative  assays  to 
measure the plasma levels of the factor Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, 
respectively.

SIDE  EFFECTS  Like  all  anticoagulants,  bleeding  is  the  most  com-
mon  side  effect  of  the  DOACs.  The  DOACS  are  associated  with  less 
intracranial  bleeding  than  warfarin,  but  the  higher  dose  regimens  of 
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban are associated with more gas-
trointestinal bleeding.

Dyspepsia occurs in up to 10% of patients treated with dabigatran; 
this problem improves with time and can be minimized by administer-
ing the drug with food. Dyspepsia is rare with rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
and edoxaban.

PERIPROCEDURAL  MANAGEMENT  Like  warfarin,  the  DOACs  must 
be stopped before procedures associated with a moderate or high risk of 
bleeding. The drugs should be held for 1–2 days, or longer if renal func-
tion is impaired. Assessment of residual anticoagulant activity before 
procedures associated with a high bleeding risk is prudent.

MANAGEMENT OF BLEEDING  With minor bleeding, withholding one 
or two doses of drug is usually sufficient. With more serious bleeding, 
the  approach  is  similar  to  that  with  warfarin,  except  that  vitamin  K 
administration is of no benefit; the anticoagulant and any antiplatelet 
drugs should be withheld, the patient should be resuscitated with fluids 
and blood products as necessary, and the bleeding site should be identi-
fied and managed. Coagulation testing or measurement of DOAC level 
will determine the extent of anticoagulation, and renal function should 
be assessed so that the half-life of the drug can be calculated. Timing of 
the last dose of anticoagulant is important; oral activated charcoal may 
help prevent absorption of drug administered in the past 4 h, partic-
ularly in cases of overdose. If >24 h have elapsed since the last intake, 
the DOAC is unlikely to be responsible for the bleeding unless there is 
marked impairment of renal function.

Anticoagulant  reversal  should  be  considered  if  bleeding  continues 
despite  supportive  measures  or  if  the  bleeding  is  life-threatening  or 
occurs in a critical organ (e.g., intracranial) or in a closed space (e.g., 
the  pericardium  or  retroperitoneum).  Idarucizumab  is  licensed  for 
dabigatran reversal in such patients or in those requiring urgent sur-
gery or intervention. A humanized antibody fragment, idarucizumab, 
binds dabigatran with high affinity to form an essentially irreversible 
complex that is cleared by the kidneys. Idarucizumab is given intrave-
nously as a 5-g bolus and is supplied in a box containing two 50-mL 
vials,  each  containing  2.5  g  of  idarucizumab.  Idarucizumab  rapidly 
reverses  the  anticoagulant  effects  of  dabigatran  and  normalizes  the 
aPTT, diluted thrombin time, or ecarin clot time.

Andexanet alfa is available for reversal of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and 
edoxaban. A recombinant variant of factor Xa without catalytic activity, 
andexanet serves as a decoy to sequester oral factor Xa inhibitors until 
they are cleared from the circulation. Low- or high-dose IV andexanet 
regimens are used. The low-dose regimen starts with a bolus of 400 mg  
followed by an infusion of 4 mg/min for up to 120 min, whereas the 
high-dose regimen starts with a bolus of 800 mg followed by an infu-
sion of 8 mg/min for up to 120 min. The low-dose regimen is used for 
reversal of doses of rivaroxaban or apixaban of 10 mg or 5 mg or less, 
respectively, or for any dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban if the last dose 
was taken >8 h prior to presentation. The high-dose regimen is used to 
reverse rivaroxaban or apixaban doses over 10 and 5 mg, respectively, 
if  the  last  dose  was  taken  <8  h  since  presentation,  or  for  reversal  if 
the dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban or the timing of the last dose is 
unknown.

Andexanet  alfa  is  expensive  and  is  not  available  in  all  hospitals. 
Because  of  its  cost,  andexanet  alfa  is  often  reserved  for  reversal  in 
patients  with  life-threatening  bleeds  such  intracranial  hemorrhage  or 
bleeds into a closed space such as retroperitoneal or pericardial bleeds. If 
andexanet is unavailable, the results of prospective cohort studies suggest 
that four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (25–50 units/kg) also 
is effective at restoring hemostasis. If there is continued bleeding, acti-
vated  prothrombin  complex  concentrate  (50  units/kg)  or  recombinant 
factor VIIa (90 μg/kg) can be considered.

Neither andexanet alfa nor four-factor prothrombin complex con-
centrate  has  been  evaluated  for  reversal  in  patients  requiring  urgent 
surgery or intervention. Furthermore, andexanet alfa not only reverses 
oral  factor  Xa  inhibitors  but  also  reverses  heparin  and  LMWH.  This 
could be problematic in patients who require cardiac surgery or vas-
cular surgery, procedures where heparin is used routinely. To circum-
vent this problem, most surgical procedures and interventions can be 
undertaken  without  reversal,  and  four-factor  prothrombin  complex 
concentrate can be given if necessary. For patients requiring surgery to 
stop bleeding such as those with a ruptured aortic aneurysm or with 
bleeding  secondary  to  polytrauma,  upfront  four-factor  prothrombin 
concentrate administration can be considered.
PREGNANCY  As small molecules, the DOACs pass through the pla-
centa.  Consequently,  these  agents  are  contraindicated  in  pregnancy, 
and  when  used  by  women  of  childbearing  potential,  appropriate 
contraception is important. The DOACs should be avoided in nursing 
mothers.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyFIBRINOLYTIC DRUGS
 ■ ROLE OF FIBRINOLYTIC THERAPY
Fibrinolytic drugs are used to degrade thrombi and are administered 
systemically or can be delivered via catheters directly into the substance 
of the thrombus. Systemic delivery is used for treatment of acute MI, 
acute ischemic stroke, and most cases of massive PE. The goal of ther-
apy is to produce rapid thrombus dissolution, thereby restoring blood 
flow.  In  the  coronary  circulation,  restoration  of  blood  flow  reduces 
morbidity and mortality rates by limiting myocardial damage, whereas 
in  the  cerebral  circulation,  rapid  thrombus  dissolution  decreases  the 
neuronal  death  and  brain  infarction  that  produce  irreversible  brain 
injury. For patients with massive PE, the goal of thrombolytic therapy 
is to restore pulmonary artery perfusion.

Peripheral arterial thrombi and thrombi in the proximal deep veins 
of the leg are most often treated using catheter-directed thrombolytic 
therapy. Catheters with multiple side holes can be used to enhance drug 
delivery. In some cases, intravascular devices that fragment and extract 
the thrombus are used to hasten treatment. These devices can be used 
alone or in conjunction with fibrinolytic drugs.

 ■ MECHANISM OF ACTION
Currently approved fibrinolytic agents include streptokinase; acylated 
plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (anistreplase); urokinase; 
recombinant  tissue-type  plasminogen  activator  (rtPA),  which  is  also 
known  as  alteplase  or  activase;  and  two  recombinant  derivatives  of 
rtPA,  tenecteplase  and  reteplase.  All  these  agents  act  by  converting 
plasminogen, the zymogen, to plasmin, the active enzyme (Fig. 118-7). 
Plasmin then degrades the fibrin matrix of thrombi and produces sol-
uble fibrin degradation products.

Endogenous fibrinolysis is regulated at two levels. Plasminogen 
activator  inhibitors,  particularly  the  type  1  form  (PAI-1),  prevent 
excessive plasminogen activation by regulating the activity of tPA and 
urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Once plasmin is gener-
ated, it is regulated by plasmin inhibitors, the most important of which 
is α2-antiplasmin. The plasma concentration of plasminogen is twofold 
higher than that of α2-antiplasmin. Consequently, with pharmacologic 
doses of plasminogen activators, the concentration of plasmin that is 
generated can exceed that of α2-antiplasmin. In addition to degrading 
fibrin,  unregulated  plasmin  can  also  degrade  fibrinogen  and  other 
clotting factors. This process, which is known as the systemic lytic state, 
reduces the hemostatic potential of the blood and increases the risk of 
bleeding.

The  endogenous  fibrinolytic  system  is  geared  to  localize  plasmin 
generation  to  the  fibrin  surface.  Both  plasminogen  and  tPA  bind  to 
fibrin to form a ternary complex that promotes efficient plasminogen 
activation. In contrast to free plasmin, plasmin generated on the fibrin 
surface  is  relatively  protected  from  inactivation  by  α2-antiplasmin, 
a  feature  that  promotes  fibrin  dissolution.  Furthermore,  C-terminal 
lysine  residues,  exposed  as  plasmin  degrades  fibrin,  serve  as  binding 
sites  for  additional  plasminogen  and  tPA  molecules.  This  creates  a

positive feedback that enhances plasmin generation. When used phar-
macologically,  the  various  plasminogen  activators  capitalize  on  these 
mechanisms to a lesser or greater extent.

Plasminogen  activators  that  preferentially  activate  fibrin-bound 
plasminogen  are  considered  fibrin-specific.  In  contrast,  nonspecific 
plasminogen activators do not discriminate between fibrin-bound and 
circulating plasminogen. Activation of circulating plasminogen results 
in the generation of unopposed plasmin that can trigger the systemic 
lytic state. Alteplase and its derivatives are fibrin-specific plasminogen 
activators, whereas streptokinase, anistreplase, and urokinase are non-
specific agents.
 ■ STREPTOKINASE
Unlike  other  plasminogen  activators,  streptokinase  is  not  an  enzyme 
and does not directly convert plasminogen to plasmin. Instead, strep-
tokinase forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen. Formation 
of  this  complex  induces  a  conformational  change  in  plasminogen  that 
exposes its active site (Fig. 118-8). The streptokinase-plasminogen com-
plex then converts additional plasminogen to plasmin.

Streptokinase  has  no  affinity  for  fibrin,  and  the  streptokinase- 
plasminogen  complex  activates  both  free  and  fibrin-bound  plas-
minogen.  Activation  of  circulating  plasminogen  generates  sufficient 
amounts  of  plasmin  to  overwhelm  α2-antiplasmin.  Unopposed  plas-
min  not  only  degrades  fibrin  in  the  occlusive  thrombus  but  also 
induces a systemic lytic state.

When  given  systemically  to  patients  with  acute  MI,  streptokinase 
reduces mortality. For this indication, the drug is usually given as an 
IV infusion of 1.5 million units over 30–60 min. Patients who receive 
streptokinase can develop antibodies against the drug, as can patients 
with  prior  streptococcal  infection.  These  antibodies  can  reduce  the 
effectiveness of streptokinase.

Allergic reactions occur in ~5% of patients treated with streptoki-
nase. These may manifest as a rash, fever, chills, and rigors. Although 
anaphylactic reactions can occur, these are rare. Transient hypotension 
is  common  with  streptokinase  and  has  been  attributed  to  plasmin-
mediated release of bradykinin from kininogen. The hypotension usu-
ally responds to leg elevation and administration of IV fluids and low 
doses of vasopressors, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.
 ■ ANISTREPLASE
To  generate  this  drug,  streptokinase  is  combined  with  equimolar 
amounts of Lys-plasminogen, a plasmin-cleaved form of plasminogen

Plasminogen

FIGURE  118-7  The  fibrinolytic  system  and  its  regulation.  Plasminogen  activators 
convert  plasminogen  to  plasmin.  Plasmin  then  degrades  fibrin  into  soluble  fibrin 
degradation products. The system is regulated at two levels. Type 1 plasminogen 
activator  inhibitor  (PAI-1)  regulates  the  plasminogen  activators,  whereas  α2-
antiplasmin serves as the major inhibitor of plasmin.

Streptokinase

FIGURE  118-8  Mechanism  of  action  of  streptokinase.  Streptokinase  binds  to 
plasminogen and induces a conformational change in plasminogen that exposes its 
active site. The streptokinase/plasmin(ogen) complex then serves as the activator 
of additional plasminogen.

938 with a Lys residue at its N terminal. The active site of Lys-plasminogen 
that is exposed upon combination with streptokinase is then masked 
with an anisoyl group. After IV infusion, the anisoyl group is slowly 
removed  by  deacylation,  giving  the  complex  a  half-life  of  ~100  min. 
This allows drug administration via a single bolus infusion.

Although  it  is  more  convenient  to  administer,  anistreplase  offers 
few  mechanistic  advantages  over  streptokinase.  Like  streptokinase, 
anistreplase  does  not  distinguish  between  fibrin-bound  and  circulat-
ing plasminogen. Consequently, it too produces a systemic lytic state. 
Likewise, allergic reactions and hypotension are just as frequent with 
anistreplase as they are with streptokinase.

When  anistreplase  was  compared  with  alteplase  in  patients  with 
acute MI, reperfusion was obtained more rapidly with alteplase than 
with  anistreplase.  Improved  reperfusion  was  associated  with  a  trend 
toward  better  clinical  outcomes  and  reduced  mortality  rate  with 
alteplase.  These  results  and  the  high  cost  of  anistreplase  have  damp-
ened the enthusiasm for its use.
 ■ UROKINASE
Urokinase  is  a  two-chain  serine  protease  derived  from  cultured  fetal 
kidney  cells  with  a  molecular  weight  of  34,000.  Urokinase  converts 
plasminogen to plasmin directly by cleaving the Arg560-Val561 bond. 
Unlike streptokinase, urokinase is not immunogenic and allergic reac-
tions are rare. Urokinase produces a systemic lytic state because it does 
not discriminate between fibrin-bound and circulating plasminogen.

Despite  many  years  of  use,  urokinase  has  never  been  systemically 
evaluated  for  coronary  thrombolysis.  Instead,  urokinase  is  often 
employed  for  catheter-directed  lysis  of  thrombi  in  the  deep  veins  or 
the peripheral arteries. Because of production problems, urokinase is 
no longer available.
 ■ ALTEPLASE
A  recombinant  form  of  single-chain  tPA,  alteplase  has  a  molecular 
weight of 68,000. Alteplase is rapidly converted into its two-chain form 
by plasmin. Although single- and two-chain forms of tPA have equiv-
alent activity in the presence of fibrin, in its absence, single-chain tPA 
has tenfold lower activity.

Alteplase  consists  of  five  discrete  domains  (Fig.  118-9);  the  
N-terminal  A  chain  of  two-chain  alteplase  contains  four  of  these 
domains. Residues 4 through 50 make up the finger domain, a region 
that resembles the finger domain of fibronectin; residues 50 through 
87 are homologous with epidermal growth factor, whereas residues 92 
through 173 and 180 through 261, which have homology to the kringle

kringles  (K1  and  K2,  respectively),  and  protease  (P)  domains  are  illustrated.  The 
glycosylation site (Y) on K1 has been repositioned in tenecteplase to endow it with 
a  longer  half-life.  In  addition,  a  tetra-alanine  substitution  in  the  protease  domain 
renders  tenecteplase  resistant  to  type  1  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  (PAI-1) 
inhibition. Reteplase is a truncated variant that lacks the F, EGF, and K1 domains.

domains of plasminogen, are designated as the first and second kringle, 
respectively.  The  fifth  alteplase  domain  is  the  protease  domain;  it  is 
located on the C-terminal B chain of two-chain alteplase.

The  interaction  of  alteplase  with  fibrin  is  mediated  by  the  finger 
domain  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  by  the  second  kringle  domain.  The 
affinity of alteplase for fibrin is considerably higher than that for fibrin-
ogen. Consequently, the catalytic efficiency of plasminogen activation 
by alteplase is two to three orders of magnitude higher in the presence 
of fibrin than in the presence of fibrinogen. This phenomenon helps to 
localize plasmin generation to the fibrin surface.

Although alteplase preferentially activates plasminogen in the pres-
ence of fibrin, alteplase is not as fibrin-selective as was first predicted. 
Its  fibrin  specificity  is  limited  because  like  fibrin,  (DD)E,  the  major 
soluble degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, binds alteplase and 
plasminogen  with  high  affinity.  Consequently,  (DD)E  is  as  potent  as 
fibrin as a stimulator of plasminogen activation by alteplase. Whereas 
plasmin generated on the fibrin surface results in thrombolysis, plas-
min generated on the surface of circulating (DD)E degrades fibrino-
gen. Fibrinogen degradation results in the accumulation of fragment 
X, a high-molecular-weight clottable fibrinogen degradation product. 
Incorporation of fragment X into hemostatic plugs formed at sites of 
vascular  injury  renders  them  susceptible  to  lysis.  This  phenomenon 
may contribute to alteplase-induced bleeding.

A  trial  comparing  alteplase  with  streptokinase  for  treatment  of 
patients with acute MI demonstrated significantly lower mortality with 
alteplase than with streptokinase, although the absolute difference was 
small.  The  greatest  benefit  was  seen  in  patients  age  <75  years  with 
anterior MI who presented <6 h after symptom onset.

For treatment of acute MI or acute ischemic stroke, alteplase is given 
as an IV infusion over 60–90 min. The total dose of alteplase usually 
ranges from 90 to 100 mg. Allergic reactions and hypotension are rare, 
and alteplase is not immunogenic.

 ■ TENECTEPLASE
Tenecteplase  is  a  genetically  engineered  variant  of  tPA  and  was 
designed to have a longer half-life than tPA and to be resistant to inac-
tivation by PAI-1. To prolong its half-life, a new glycosylation site was 
added to the first kringle domain (Fig. 118-9). Because addition of this 
extra carbohydrate side chain reduced fibrin affinity, the existing gly-
cosylation site on the first kringle domain was removed. To render the 
molecule resistant to inhibition by PAI-1, a tetra-alanine substitution 
was introduced at residues 296–299 in the protease domain, the region 
responsible for the interaction of tPA with PAI-1.

Tenecteplase is more fibrin-specific than tPA. Although both agents 
bind  to  fibrin  with  similar  affinity,  the  affinity  of  tenecteplase  for 
(DD)E  is  significantly  lower  than  that  of  tPA.  Consequently,  (DD)E 
does not stimulate systemic plasminogen activation by tenecteplase to 
the same extent as tPA. As a result, tenecteplase produces less fibrino-
gen degradation than tPA.

For coronary thrombolysis, tenecteplase is given as a single IV bolus. 
In  a  large  phase  III  trial  that  enrolled  >16,000  patients,  the  30-day 
mortality rate with single-bolus tenecteplase was similar to that with 
accelerated-dose tPA. Although rates of intracranial hemorrhage were 
also similar with both treatments, patients given tenecteplase had fewer 
noncerebral  bleeds  and  a  reduced  need  for  blood  transfusions  than 
those  treated  with  tPA.  The  improved  safety  profile  of  tenecteplase 
likely reflects its enhanced fibrin specificity.

 ■ RETEPLASE
Reteplase  is  a  single-chain,  recombinant  tPA  derivative  that  lacks 
the  finger,  epidermal  growth  factor,  and  first  kringle  domains  (Fig. 
118-9).  This  truncated  derivative  has  a  molecular  weight  of  39,000. 
Reteplase binds fibrin more weakly than tPA because it lacks the fin-
ger domain. Because it is produced in Escherichia coli, reteplase is not 
glycosylated.  This  endows  it  with  a  plasma  half-life  longer  than  that 
of tPA. Consequently, reteplase is given as two IV boluses, which are 
separated by 30 min. Clinical trials have demonstrated that reteplase is 
at least as effective as streptokinase for treatment of acute MI, but the 
agent is not superior to tPA.

PART 4Oncology and HematologyCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Thrombosis involves a complex interplay among the vessel wall, plate-
lets, the coagulation system, and the fibrinolytic pathways. Activation of 
coagulation  also  triggers  inflammatory  pathways  that  may  exacerbate 
thrombosis. A better understanding of the biochemistry of blood coagu-
lation and advances in structure-based drug design have identified new 
targets and resulted in the development of novel antithrombotic drugs. 
Well-designed  clinical  trials  have  provided  detailed  information  on 
which drugs to use and when to use them. Despite these advances, how-
ever, thromboembolic disorders remain a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality. Therefore, the search for better and safer targets continues.
