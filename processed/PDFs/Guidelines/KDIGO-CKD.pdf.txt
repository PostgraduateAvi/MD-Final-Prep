NOMENCLATURE AND DESCRIPTION FOR RATING GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS

Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting
evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D.

Grade

Level 1
“We recommend”

Patients

Most people in your situation would
want the recommended course of
action, and only a small proportion
would not.

Level 2
“We suggest”

The majority of people in your situation
would want the recommended course
of action, but many would not.

Implications

Clinicians

Most patients should receive the
recommended course of action.

Policy

The recommendation can be evaluated
as a candidate for developing a policy
or a performance measure.

Different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. Each patient needs
help to arrive at a management
decision consistent with their values
and preferences.

The recommendation is likely to require
substantial debate and involvement of
stakeholders before policy can be
determined.

Grade

Certainty of evidence

Meaning

A
B
C
D

High
Moderate
Low
Very low

We are conﬁdent that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect.
The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often, it will be far from the true effect.

Practice points are consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded. They are issued when a
clinical question did not have a systematic review performed, to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendation (e.g., frequency
of monitoring, provision of standard care [such as regular clinic visits], referral to specialist care, etc.), or for issuing “good practice statements” when
the alternative is considered to be absurd. Users should consider the practice point as expert guidance and use it as they see ﬁt to inform the care of
patients. Although these statements are developed based on a different methodology, they should not be seen as “less important” or a “downgrade”
from graded recommendations.

CURRENT CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) NOMENCLATURE USED BY KDIGO

CKD is deﬁned as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months, with implications for health. CKD is
classiﬁed based on Cause, Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) category (G1–G5), and Albuminuria category (A1–A3), abbreviated as CGA.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
organization was established in 2003 with the mission to
improve the care and outcomes of people living with kidney
disease worldwide. The development and implementation of
global clinical practice guidelines is central to the many ac-
tivities of KDIGO to fulﬁll its mission. Twenty years later, we
are excited to present this update of the KDIGO Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to complement the existing
12 guidelines that address various other facets of kidney
disease management.

Our aspiration is that the KDIGO CKD Guideline serves as
a comprehensive reference for evidence-based practices, of-
fering clear and valuable guidance for the optimal diagnosis
and treatment of CKD. The updated guideline is the result of
a rigorous process, extensively detailed in the KDIGO
Methods Manual. To promote objectivity and transparency,
we screen Guideline Co-Chairs and Work Group members
(which include clinicians, researchers, and patients) for con-
ﬂicts of interest. Over a span of 2–3 years, these individuals
volunteer their time, starting with the creation of a Scope of
Work that undergoes an open public review to engage all
stakeholders. This document is then adapted into a Request
for Proposal, which is used to enlist an independent Evidence
Review Team.

The Evidence Review Team conducts a systematic review of
existing literature, extracting studies with appropriate design
and outcomes deemed important by both people with CKD
and clinicians. All work is meticulously graded on study
quality and potential bias, forming the basis for quantifying
the overall certainty of the evidence using the “Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evalua-
tion” (GRADE) approach. The penultimate version of the
guideline also undergoes public review to capture additional
perspectives. Thus, guidelines are the result of a rigorous and
objective assessment of available evidence, enriched by the
collective expertise of healthcare providers, researchers, and
patients alike. Guideline statements (“We recommend” or
“We suggest”) reﬂect clinical questions that were addressed by

the evidence reviews from the Evidence Review Team. Practice
points provide guidance on clinical questions that were not,
and largely could not be, studied by the Evidence Review
Team.

We view the current guideline as a dynamic, evolving
resource rather than a static document. We are delighted by the
recent pace of clinical discovery that substantially increased the
scientiﬁc basis of optimal CKD diagnosis and management,
and we remain committed to updating recommendations and
practice points as important evidence emerges. We hope that
the guideline will serve as a useful tool for clinicians in their
daily practice, providing clear insight into the evidence-based
recommendations while highlighting areas requiring further
research. Ultimately, our aim is to facilitate more effective and
consistent care to patients with CKD worldwide, and the
publication of the CKD Guideline will provide the foundation
of many dissemination and implementation activities to in-
crease the outreach and usefulness of this work.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude for all those who have
contributed to the CKD Guideline. First, to the members of
the Methods Committee, particularly Dr. Marcello Tonelli,
MD, SM, MSc, Chair of the Committee, and Amy Earley, BS,
KDIGO Guideline Development Director,
for setting the
expectation of rigor, balance, and transparency throughout
the process. Next, to the Evidence Review Team at Johns
Hopkins University, for their meticulous work in reviewing
the existing literature. Third, to the Work Group members,
led by the indefatigable Drs. Adeera Levin, MD, and Paul
Stevens, MB, for their diligence and innumerable hours vol-
unteered to shepherd the guideline to publication. Fourth, to
the many individuals who provided comments during the
rounds of public review. Finally, to the whole KDIGO staff,
for their steadfast, behind the scenes commitment to excel-
lence in patient care.

Abstract

a b s t r a c t

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for
the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an update to the KDIGO
2012 guideline on the topic. The aim is to assist clinicians caring for people with CKD, both
adults and children. People receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients are not the focus of
this guideline. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation of CKD, risk assessment in
people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and manage its complications, medical
management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. In addition, this
guideline includes a comprehensive introduction from the guideline Co-Chairs, a patient
foreword, a discussion of special population considerations, a presentation of the relative and
absolute risks associated with speciﬁc outcomes from the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-
PC), and an extensive section dedicated to research recommendations based on the current gaps
in evidence. The goal of the guideline is to generate a useful resource for clinicians and patients by
providing actionable recommendations based on a rigorous formal evidence review, practice
points that serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not con-
ducted, and useful infographics. The guideline targets a broad audience of healthcare providers
involved in the care of people with CKD as well as people with CKD themselves while being
mindful of implications for policy and payment. Development of this guideline update followed
an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline rec-
ommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies, and appraisal of the certainty
of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the “Grading of Recommenda-
tions Assessment, Development, and Evaluation” (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evi-
dence are discussed, with areas of future research also presented.

Patient foreword
The identiﬁcation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) begins a
long journey for any patient that will have a direct impact on
their lifestyle and future health outcomes. This guideline
identiﬁes the suitability of medical
interventions that can
improve or delay the seriousness of CKD and possible kidney
failure.

In a complicated world of health provision, having a set of
evidential recommendations and practice points provides
kidney service providers with the targets for a quality CKD
service for people with kidney disease. However, if the starting
point for many people is ignorance of what a kidney actually
does, then without a holistic approach to patient care, much of
the potential effectiveness of medical interventions can be
diluted because of patient circumstances and psychological
challenges.

Acceptance of the seriousness of CKD can take a lot
longer for a person to process, to the possible detriment of

medical
adherence.

intervention, and may well

lead to issues over

A controlled, managed CKD decline is so beneﬁcial to
patients who have so many social issues to contend with, be it
diet, tiredness, liquid control, pill overload, and a deep dive
into the very mechanics of how we eat and drink to survive
and excrete excesses.

In an ever-increasingly busy world of medical care, as pa-
tients, we believe that the best approach is for any physician to
aim to achieve a partnership of knowledge with the patient
regarding their CKD care. This will build patient conﬁdence and
self-awareness, with the aim that any patient who sadly arrives at
possible dialysis is in the right state of mind, which is critical for a
considered approach to the next stage of a patient’s journey.

Introduction, qualifying statements, and key concepts

This 2024 update of the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline
for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-
ease (CKD)1 is an evidence-based guideline that provides

management activities.

points

and

for

The past 10 years have provided new hope for improved
treatment of CKD. A greater understanding of healthy lifestyle
and lifestyle modiﬁcations together with new medications
and technologies furnish improved options for treatment and
monitoring of CKD. People with CKD, healthcare providers,
and health systems are eager to implement these advances in
the most effective and evidence-based manner. This requires
integration of new therapies with lifestyle management and
existing medications using approaches that engage patients
and optimize application of health resources. The goal of this
guideline document is to provide such guidance. The majority
of statements from the 2012 guideline have been updated
based on current knowledge and practice. Only 6 statements
were retained in their original form in 2012.

As Co-Chairs, we would like to recognize the outstanding
efforts of the Work Group, the Evidence Review Team (ERT),
and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
staff. The Work Group was diverse, multinational, multidis-
ciplinary, experienced, thoughtful, and dedicated. Notably,
the Work Group included 2 members who have CKD who
contributed actively as peers to keep the guideline relevant
and patient-centered. We are indebted to each and every in-
dividual who contributed to this process. We hope that the
guidance provided here will help improve the care of people
with CKD worldwide.

The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was built on the United
States (US)-based Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative
(KDOQI) 2002 Guideline on Deﬁnition, Classiﬁcation, and
Evaluation of CKD,2
international
accepted
community in 2005. It reinforced the deﬁnition of CKD
incorporating a persistent reduction in glomerular ﬁltration
rate (GFR) and markers of kidney damage and modiﬁed the
staging and classiﬁcation system to include elements that
had begun to be appreciated by the clinical community.3
Speciﬁcally, the 2012 guideline introduced the concept of a
“CGA” classiﬁcation of CKD based on cause (C), level of
kidney function determined by GFR (G), and degree of
albuminuria (A). The CGA classiﬁcation laid a foundation
treatment, research, and risk
upon which management,
assessment of CKD have since been based.

The deﬁnition, staging, and classiﬁcation of CKD pro-
posed by the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline have been widely
accepted and implemented worldwide. Research has since
highlighted that higher speciﬁc stages or categories of CKD,
characterized by level of GFR and albuminuria independently,
portend greater relative risk (RR) for adverse outcomes.4–7
These include, but are not limited to, CKD progression,

cardiovascular disease (CVD), mortality (all-cause and car-
diovascular), kidney failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI).
The development of risk-prediction tools has reﬁned moni-
toring and referral to specialist nephrology and has aided in
the estimation of prognosis.6,8–10 Although there remains
ongoing discussion about application of the same thresholds
to deﬁne disease in older adults,11 it is still clear that even
in older populations, risk of adverse outcomes increases
with higher CKD stages (Figure 1).12 In any ﬁeld of
medicine, although data from large population studies

(GFR
the
categories G3a–G5) for >3 months to indicate a diagnosis
of CKD is well below the average in young adult men and
women,13 but because a signiﬁcant GFR reduction in
younger people is also usually associated with other markers
of kidney disease, the diagnosis of CKD would be captured.
Similarly, we recognize that
there is an average age-
associated GFR decline observed in longitudinal and cross-
sectional studies,14 but with substantial variation among
individuals within the population,15
such that not all
individuals will have a signiﬁcant GFR decline with age.12

and
is critically important

This guideline is not intended to be a textbook, and thus
statements regarding prevention and screening for CKD,
although important topics, are not addressed in depth but are
brieﬂy discussed below in the context of the global burden of
CKD and in Chapter 1. For a more detailed discussion of these
issues, we refer readers to existing textbooks and reviews.16–18
Prevention and screening for CKD should be conducted
mostly by healthcare providers in primary care and in other
specialties, such as endocrinology, cardiology, and oncology,
rather than restricted to nephrologists. We strongly support
efforts aimed at the early detection and treatment of CKD
among people at high risk for CKD, including those with
hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. Screening efforts in these
and other populations should include assessments of GFR
(estimated or in certain situations measured [see Section 1.2]
and albuminuria [or surrogate, see Section 1.3]).

The intended starting point for this update of the KDIGO
2012 CKD guideline is an established diagnosis of CKD,
though there are some practice points to clarify the evaluation
of CKD and the ascertainment of chronicity. The care of
people with CKD is multifaceted and complex. Several critical
aspects of this comprehensive care, such as blood pressure
(BP), diabetes, and lipid management, have been addressed in
other KDIGO guidelines. These topics were not reviewed for
the current guideline, but recommendations have been
incorporated where relevant and we refer readers to those
speciﬁc KDIGO guidelines and their updates.19–23

following rule: the percentile shaded the darkest green color corresponds to the proportion of cells in the grid without CKD (e.g., 6 of 24 cells),
and the percentile shaded the darkest red color corresponds to proportion expected to be at highest risk (e.g., 5 of 24 cells). In this manner, the

This clinical practice guideline includes 2 different types of
statements: graded recommendations, which are supported by
systematic reviews (i.e., de novo reviews conducted by the in-
dependent ERT or existing high-quality reviews that have been
systematically identiﬁed), and ungraded practice points, which
serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic
review was not conducted for various reasons (e.g., lack of a
sufﬁcient evidence base or randomized controlled trials
[RCTs] would be impractical/unethical). Both recommenda-
tions and practice points are intended to help guide clinical
practice and aid in decision-making; thus, they collectively are
the guidance statements. They are clearly articulated and
presented together so that all guideline statements can be
implemented. The distinction between them is based on the
process by which they are derived, that process is based on the
framework methodology from the KDIGO Methods Com-
mittee and aligns with other international guideline groups
utilizing the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation” (GRADE) methodology.

Several exciting developments have been introduced into
clinical practice since the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was

published. These include reﬁnement of evaluation of GFR,
population and individual risk prediction, and novel treat-
ments which have all positively inﬂuenced the prognosis for
people with CKD. The Work Group has aimed to generate a
guideline that is both rigorously devoted to new and existing
evidence, and clinically useful.

Research recommendations are presented in a separate
section at the end of this document and are intended to guide
the next set of important research questions to inform and
improve outcomes of people living with CKD. The research
recommendations are not exhaustive but are intended to help
focus the clinical and research communities on unanswered
questions including improving diagnostic tools and evalua-
tion of kidney function, development and testing of risk
prediction equations in clinical and research settings, evalu-
ation of different therapies to delay progression in various
and
combinations,
optimal models of care. We speciﬁcally urge the community
to be inclusive of people across the lifecycle and include sex
and gender, and etiology of CKD, as important variables in all
studies.

Deﬁnition and classiﬁcation of CKD

Deﬁning CKD. CKD is deﬁned as abnormalities of kidney
structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months,
with implications for health (Table 1).1

Classifying CKD. CKD is classiﬁed based on Cause, GFR
category (G1–G5), and Albuminuria category (A1–A3),
abbreviated as CGA.1 These 3 components of
the
classiﬁcation system are each critical in the assessment of
people with CKD and help enable determination of severity
and risk. Listed below are reference tables describing each
component. Note that while the deﬁnition of CKD includes
many different markers of kidney damage and is not
conﬁned to decreased GFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(ACR) >30 mg/g [>3 mg/mmol], the classiﬁcation system
is based on the 2 dimensions of GFR and degree of
albuminuria (Tables 2 and 3). This nuance is often missed
by healthcare providers and students.

It is well established that patient advocates with CKD and
healthcare providers prefer the more clinically useful and
generally understood assessment of GFR resulting from the
use of GFR estimating equations compared with serum
creatinine (SCr) alone. Globally, although still not universally
available in all countries, SCr is measured routinely and the
approach to assessment of GFR is therefore to use SCr and an
estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR. The
approach to evaluation of GFR using initial and supportive
tests is described in greater detail in Chapter 1.

Etiology of CKD should be sought, and there are
numerous systems for grouping various etiologies, some of
which are evolving with new knowledge and diagnostic tools.
There are congenital and genetic causes of CKD, some asso-
ciated with systemic diseases, and others that are primary. It is
beyond our remit to suggest a speciﬁc approach, but we
highlight the importance of establishing a cause to individ-
ualize management of CKD.

The global burden of CKD
The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors
Study (GBD) pulls together data on premature death and
disability from more than 350 diseases and injuries in 204
countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present.24 Disease

Society

and International

Globally, in 2017, a systematic analysis from the all-age
GBD project found 697.5 million (95% uncertainty interval
[UI]: 649.2–752.0) cases of all-stage CKD, for a global preva-
lence of 9.1% (8.5%–9.8%).25 By 2021, a joint statement from
the American Society of Nephrology, European Renal
Association,
of Nephrology
indicated that more than 850 million people suffer from
some form of kidney disease, roughly double the number of
people who live with diabetes (422 million) and 20 times
more than the prevalence of cancer worldwide (42 million)
or people living with AIDS/HIV (36.7 million). These
studies worldwide,
estimates derive from aggregation of
which have applied a variety of deﬁnitions of CKD;
nevertheless, they furnish the best guide about global CKD
prevalence.

In 2017, CKD was estimated to account for 35.8 million
(95% UI: 33.7e38.0) DALYs, and 1.2 million people died
from CKD. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated in
the 3 lowest quintiles of sociodemographic index (SDI). In
2019, CKD was responsible for 41.5 million (95% UI: 38.3–
45.0) DALYs, and 1.43 million people died from CKD.24 Age-
standardized DALY rates (Figure 224) were highest in central
and Andean Latin America, at 1348.1 (1203.6–1521.6) and
836.3 (704.2–981.6) per 100,000, respectively (global rate
was 514.9 [474.9–558.9]).
In 2017, CKD in diabetes
represented a third of all DALYs, and there were 1.4 million

Screening and prevention
Despite the increasing recognition of the true burden of CKD,
there remains controversy and lack of consensus as to the
utility of population screening for CKD26 or
targeted
screening programs,18 due
the
underlying sociopolitical and resource environment. Public
health policy has a role
to play in identifying and
addressing risk factors to prevent CKD, to identify CKD
early, and to delay its progression and associated adverse
outcomes. Education of both health personnel and the
populations at risk, implementation of early kidney disease
detection programs, and incorporation of evidence-based
treatment of CKD and its associated conditions, such as BP
and diabetes, are all essential components of a strategy to
address this burden. A systematic review suggested that
screening for CKD is cost-effective in people with diabetes

This evidence aligns with the KDIGO Controversies Con-
ference on Early Detection and Intervention in CKD, which
concluded that early identiﬁcation of CKD in people at risk,
who are usually asymptomatic, would likely be beneﬁcial in the
community and primary care settings if the programs are
interwoven with risk stratiﬁcation and treatment.17 A
community program must be able to provide treatment to
the high-risk group of patients with newly detected CKD to
justify systematic early detection strategies. An additional
conclusion was that screening and treatment programs for
CKD should be implemented based on risk stratiﬁcation to
prioritize people, particularly

signiﬁcant analgesic use and herbal medications, depending
on geographical region. Frameworks in which to consider
speciﬁc regional
factors have been offered to facilitate
discussion about the value and context of screening for CKD.26
Currently, kidney disease awareness remains low, and
worldwide only 6% of the general population and 10% of the
high-risk population are aware of their CKD status. Impor-
tant to note is that patient advocates with CKD strongly argue
for earlier CKD screening and diagnosis.17 They also advocate
for CKD detection to be integrated with patient and family
education and engagement to improve accessing appropriate
healthcare and knowledge and adherence to recommended
lifestyle modiﬁcation and medications.

albuminuria may also be used to diagnose CKD, but albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and GFR are still required to determine stage and
estimate risk of progression. Acute kidney disease (AKD) is deﬁned by the abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications
for health and with a duration of #3 months.28 The orange boxes indicate actions in people at risk for CKD and in whom testing should be
performed. The blue boxes indicate testing steps. The green boxes indicate the identiﬁcation of CKD and its stages and the initiation of
treatment. The purple box indicates the identiﬁcation of AKD/acute kidney injury (AKI). Please also see the Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury.97

Use of a simple algorithm such as that shown above in
settings such as primary care, cardiology, and endocrinology
could signiﬁcantly improve the early identiﬁcation and
treatment of CKD (Figure 3).28

There are no current evidence-based recommendations
regarding the frequency of screening in people at risk of CKD.
In the setting of diabetes, a consensus report from the Amer-
ican Diabetes Association (ADA) and KDIGO recommends
annual screening of people with diabetes for CKD.29 CKD
screening should start at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D)
because evidence of CKD is often already apparent at this
time. For type 1 diabetes (T1D), screening is recommended
commencing 5 years after diagnosis. The overall costs of a
screening program are largely driven by the frequency of
repeat screening, so the timing of repeated testing should be
guided by CKD risk. There are risk equations available to
estimate the interval risk of developing CKD, and this risk
stratiﬁcation could guide repeat testing intervals.30

International considerations
In low- and middle-income regions of the world and in the
lower sociodemographic quintiles, there is a large gap between
CKD burden and provision of adequate healthcare. There is
limited access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) combined
with the rising prevalence of diabetes and hypertension and
evidence of substantial sex and gender disparities in access to
CKD treatment. These factors highlight the importance of early
identiﬁcation and treatment of risk factors in primary care.
However, the majority of the world’s population with CKD is
in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where there are
disparities in access to laboratory diagnostic services, kidney
biopsy, and imaging services, in availability of appropriately
skilled healthcare providers and the availability and afford-
ability of medications. The International Society of Nephrology
survey assessing global kidney healthcare resources reported
that fewer than 1 in 4 surveyed countries had facilities available
for routine measurements of SCr or proteinuria.31

Importantly, slowing CKD progression at early stages
should provide economic beneﬁts and prevent the develop-
ment of kidney failure and cardiovascular complications. A
systematic review of care models in LMIC found that those
supporting primary care providers or allied health workers
achieved effectiveness in slowing GFR decline, as opposed to
interventions centered on specialty care alone.32 Where there
are resource limitations, it is logical to deploy resources where
they will be most cost-effective, for example, to higher-risk,
preventable stages.

Special considerations

The Work Group recognizes that kidney diseases affect people
at different times and with different impacts across the whole
lifespan. Thus, enabling a personalized approach, considering
age, sex, and gender for diagnosis, risk assessment, and
treatment is critical. At the extremes of age—the very young
and the very old—diagnostic procedures, treatment aims,
treatment modalities, and decision-making differ due to dif-
ferences in prognosis, treatment options, and prioritization.
In young and middle-aged adults, treatment approaches may
differ due to speciﬁc circumstances, such as pregnancy or
menopause. Sex (biological attributes) and gender (socio-
cultural factors), as well as other important intersectional
factors including but not limited to geographical location,
socioeconomic status (SES), and race and ethnicity, play
important roles in kidney health and disease.

Here we introduce concepts as to why age, sex, and gender
should be considered in the context of diagnosis, treatment,
and care planning in people with CKD. In addition, the
speciﬁc guideline chapters incorporate statements where
special considerations regarding age, sex, and gender are
relevant to clinical practice and understanding.

Considerations in children and adolescents
When the guideline refers to people with CKD, this includes
children (people <10 years old) and adolescents (people

10–19 years old). When there are altered care recommenda-
tions and practice points due to the unique needs of children
or the lack of data to inform recommendations and practice
points, these considerations are discussed within the Pediatric
considerations sections of the guideline.

The management of children and adolescents with CKD
needs special consideration (Figure 4). Children and adults have
different etiologies of CKD. Up to 40%–50% of childhood CKD
is due to congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract
(CAKUT); the younger the CKD population, the greater the
the cause.35,36 CAKUT is
proportion with CAKUT as
characterized by slower progression to kidney failure and a
higher likelihood of polyuria than the conditions causing CKD
in adults. Pediatric CKD has several unique aspects:

Delivery of care. Pediatric healthcare providers engage with
not only the person with CKD but also their carers and sib-
lings. Age-appropriate care and education, understood by
both the child and their carers, is necessary. Holistic consid-
eration of the needs and capabilities of the family unit is
important in ensuring effective CKD care. Engagement with
patients and families must change over the course of child-
hood from being entirely carer-directed for infants, changing
to include the whole family unit in childhood, and then
leaning toward the young person to ensure successful tran-
sition to adult-oriented care.

Growth, puberty, and young adulthood. Childhood and
adolescence are characterized by physical growth and devel-
opment. All CKD care aims to optimize these physiological
processes, which are commonly disrupted by CKD. Puberty is
a time of rapid somatic growth with an increase in muscle
bulk and therefore constitutes a high-risk period for CKD
progression as compromised kidneys may not hypertrophy to
adapt to the larger body size. Adolescence and emerging
adulthood bring individuation and exploration of sexuality
and adult behaviors, and kidney disease care must recognize
and adapt to these changes.

Kidney development and long-term assessment of kidney
risks. Although nephron formation is complete by 36 weeks of
gestation, kidney function continues to develop throughout
early childhood, with nephron growth and maturation pro-
gressing particularly rapidly in the ﬁrst year of life. An actual
increase in GFR over the course of the ﬁrst 1–2 years of life, and
even up to 4 years of age, is expected. A trajectory of increasing
GFR in infancy and very early childhood followed by a period of
relative stability and a subsequent progression in CKD in
adolescence or adulthood is common. Given the long life ex-
pectancy of children, follow-up plans must take into account
the risk of late CKD or kidney failure. Healthy children and
adolescents should have excellent kidney function, so an esti-
mated eGFR under 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (CKD G2–G5)
represents decreased kidney function in these age groups. Early
assessment and intervention of children with CKD is crucial to
maximize overall health across the lifespan.

Neurodevelopment and education. A primary goal of pedi-
atric CKD care is to optimize neurodevelopmental gains.
CKD can affect development, cognition, school attendance,
vocational outcomes, and future employment. Mitigating
these deﬁcits through effective, individualized care is essential
to give children with CKD the best possible future.

Considerations in older adults
Older adults constitute a substantial and steadily growing
proportion of people under nephrology and medical care
especially in Western industrialized countries.
globally,
Longevity in many parts of the world is increasing, and thus
the prevalence of CKD in those people is also increasing. The
2022 US Renal Data System (USRDS) annual data report
highlights that the number of individuals initiating KRT is
continuously ascending with increasing age. In Taiwan, for
example, KRT incidence in those aged 75þ was 2858 per
million population (pmp) compared with 1583 pmp among
people aged 65–74 years, 530 pmp among people aged 45–64
years, and 97 pmp among people aged 20–44 years. The
pattern is very similar across the globe with the majority of
people initiating dialysis over the age of 75, which puts
emphasis on a group of people who are not just old, but very
old, and incorporates more and more people over the age of
80. Octo- and nonagenarians often demonstrate distinct
patterns of disease complexity. These features include multi-
frailty,
morbidity often accompanied by polypharmacy,
and gerontopsychiatric disorders
cognitive

impairment,

among others. Often, several of these features coexist espe-
cially in older adults with CKD.

Implications for aging adults with CKD are important in
both diagnosis and treatment. The interpretation of labora-
tory results (speciﬁcally SCr) used in the staging system
should factor in an older adult’s habitus given the frequency
of sarcopenia. A creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) will over-
estimate GFR in the elderly (and others) with sarcopenia
leading to drug overdosing. Urine ACR at the same time will
be falsely high due to the falsely low creatinine in the de-
nominator. Furthermore, the presence of frailty may alter
treatment targets recommended for younger people with
CKD, as they may not necessarily be transferable to older
adults. Strict BP-lowering, for example, may come with the
risk of dizziness, falls, and fractures in older adults, many of
whom are on anticoagulants risking severe hemorrhage.

The multidimensionality of comorbidities in old age poses
challenges, as it demands a sophisticated integrated and
complex multidisciplinary care and treatment approach,
which may not be available in every healthcare system. Life
expectancy in old age is naturally limited compared with
younger people. Perspectives and treatment goals shift over
the life course, and recognizing these in very old adults, as
different from those in middle-aged or younger adults with
CKD, is critical to the development of more personalized care
plans and goals. Speciﬁcally, pure survival may become less of
a priority for an older individual, whereas maintaining an
acceptable, good quality of life (QoL) may be more impor-
tant. The context of a person’s situation and own values and
preferences may modify the prioritization for testing, treat-
ment types, and treatment goals. For example, the decision-
making between KRT and conservative care should be made
on the basis of the person’s priorities, medical needs, and
informed decision as to beneﬁts and harms of various op-
tions. These informed decisions require good communication
between caregivers, people with CKD, and their relatives/
carers; they require time, “room,” adequate understandable
language, patience, trust, and commitment. Repeated con-
versations are critical, given the higher prevalence of cognitive
deﬁcits in older adults with CKD. These cognitive issues
accompany both aging and CKD and frequently remain un-
recognized,
impeding shared decision-making and
advance care planning in this group.

thus,

In summary, older adults constitute the largest group
among all people with advanced CKD. Although every single
person needs individual care, the multidimensional medical
complexity inherent in very old age is challenging. Where
speciﬁc recommendations or practice points require special
consideration in the elderly, we make clear statements in the
special considerations section and encourage clinicians to
individualize therapies and goals of care in all patients, with
special attention to those of advanced age.

Considerations regarding sex and gender
It is increasingly recognized that sex (biological attributes)
and gender (sociocultural factors) factors across individuals

contribute to differences in kidney health and disease.37–39
Sex-based variation in genetics, physiology, immunology, and
anatomy, as well as gender factors such as identity, roles, and
relations in addition to institutionalized gender, inﬂuences
kidney disease pathophysiology, presentation, response to
therapy, complications, and outcomes, highlighting the need
to take these factors into consideration in the care of the
person living with kidney disease.

Globally, the prevalence of CKD not being treated with
dialysis deﬁned by level of eGFR is greater in women than
men.40 Progression of CKD has been reported as more rapid
in men,41,42 in women,43 or no difference by sex or gender.44
These incongruities are likely a reﬂection of differences in
cause of kidney disease and deﬁnitions of outcomes (e.g.,
loss of eGFR or receipt of KRT).

There is substantial literature demonstrating that both sex-
and gender-related factors (e.g., puberty, menstrual patterns,
hormonal contraception, pregnancy and pregnancy-related
complications, menopause, menopausal hormone therapy,
testosterone levels, and gender-afﬁrming hormone therapy)
play important roles in the risk, progression, complications,
and treatment of kidney disease.45

These factors will play prominent roles in progression of
kidney disease across different stages of the life cycle. For
example, the use of some recommended medications has not
been studied in pregnant populations, highlighting the
importance of contraceptive counseling in accordance with a
person’s values and preferences. In other instances, precon-
ception counseling, changing medications to nonteratogenic
is required to
options and a multidisciplinary approach,
optimize the outcomes of a potential pregnancy in the setting
of CKD. Sex-based differences in pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics that are accentuated with increasing age
and changing hormonal status may alter the response to
different therapies for the treatment of kidney disease. For
example, women are more likely to report adverse reactions
to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi),46 which
play a role in adherence and failure to reach guideline-
recommended target doses.

There are differences between women and men in the
detection, recognition, monitoring, referrals, and manage-
ment of CKD.47,48 Although the reasons behind these
disparities are unclear, access to kidney care may be limited
by familial and other caregiving responsibilities, as well as
ﬁnancial challenges, occupational obligations, and time
constraints, which are inﬂuenced by gender identity (how
an individual self-identiﬁes, behaves, expresses their gender,

and is perceived by others, e.g., woman, man, girl, boy,
and gender-diverse), roles (social expectations and norms
typically associated with a given gender, e.g., primary
household earner and caregiver), relations (interactions
with and treatment by others based on an individual’s
perceived
and
institutionalized gender (e.g., distribution of power and
resources in society).37

identity),

gender

and/or

A small but increasing proportion of the world’s popula-
tion identiﬁes as transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary
where sex assigned at birth differs from gender identity,
highlighting the urgent need to build transgender cultural
safety within all aspects of kidney disease management and
care.49

Taking sex and gender considerations into account is
critical to optimize the care of the individual with kidney
disease. Although there is increasing literature to inform sex-
and gender-speciﬁc recommendations in nephrology, signif-
icant knowledge gaps remain, underscoring the importance of
a person-centered approach in kidney care.

Considerations regarding fertility and pregnancy
Neither fertility nor pregnancy in people with CKD was part
of the scope of work for this guideline update, but there will
be special consideration relating to fertility and pregnancy
requiring speciﬁc reference in relevant

Fertility. CKD is associated with decreased female and male
fertility.50,51
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis appears to play a key
role in the pathophysiology, although multiple factors
contribute to the reduction in fertility in this population. In
conjunction with the decreased fertility associated in CKD
and the uncertainty of the impact of assisted reproductive
technologies on kidney function, ongoing discussion of
family planning potential between the person with CKD
and their healthcare provider is essential.

Pregnancy. People with CKD are at risk for adverse preg-
including progression of their
nancy-associated outcomes,
underlying CKD, a ﬂare of their kidney disease, and adverse
pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia, preterm
delivery, and small for gestational age infant.52,53 The severity
of CKD is associated with risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to preconception
counseling and management of pregnancy is necessary to
achieve optimal outcomes for both the person with CKD
and the infant.54

Summary of relative and absolute risks relevant to CKD
from meta-analysis of large multinational population
studies in the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC)

Outcomes relevant to CKD, and the prognostic importance of
CKD categories
The most highly evaluated endpoints in epidemiological
studies have been all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events
(myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure), and kidney-
speciﬁc outcomes (progression to kidney failure and AKI),
although additional outcomes such as all-cause hospitaliza-
tion and incident atrial ﬁbrillation have been studied more
recently. In this section, we highlight newer data derived from
the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC).12 We describe
the associations of CKD categories with 10 of
these
important outcomes and demonstrate the importance of
different methods of estimating GFR (i.e., using creatinine-
or cystatin C–based equations) on these risk gradients.

Healthcare providers,

researchers, and policy makers
should understand the association of CKD parameters (ACR
and eGFR) in populations. The overall distributions of
epidemiological risk across CKD categories on a population
level are presented here. This is not to be confused with the
information presented in Chapter 2, where individualized risk
assessment tools are described, and those tools can be used to
inform clinical and management decisions for individual
people with CKD.

Associations of all complications of CKD are incre-
mentally increased with worsened categories of estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR) and albuminuria:
updated data.

The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evalu-
ation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease introduced
the combined staging by eGFR and albuminuria categories,
which were justiﬁed by their associations with CKD complica-
tions.1 The combined associations of eGFR and ACR categories
were presented as “heatmaps,” a color-coded depiction of the
associations of
for
outcomes of all-cause mortality, kidney failure, AKI, and
cardiovascular mortality on a population level. In this section,
we provide an update to these CKD heatmaps, which have
been provided by the CKD-PC.12

Several changes in the development of

these updated

heatmaps are important to highlight.
(i) They now include several clinical databases that allow a
much larger population base, comprising up to 27,503,140
people for the analyses of each adverse outcome.

(ii) The eGFRcr has been changed to the 2021 CKD Epide-
miology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, as this
newer version no longer includes race as a component.
(iii) The number of outcomes has been increased to 10,
including 6 that are cardiovascular related, 2 that are

outcomes

(iv) Additional analyses have been conducted using the 2021
CKD-EPI combined eGFR equation that incorporates
both creatinine and cystatin C. Although the sample size
for these subsequent analyses is much smaller (n ¼
720,736), it does permit better differentiation of associ-
ations of eGFR and risk and allows validation of CKD
thresholds across populations.

CKD staging by eGFRcr and ACR and association with adverse
events
Figure 512 presents the RRs for all eGFR/ACR combinations
for the 10 identiﬁed outcomes.

The RRs presented have all been adjusted for age, sex,
smoking status (current, former, or never), systolic BP (SBP),
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
body mass index (BMI), use of antihypertensive medications,
and a medical history of diabetes, coronary heart disease,
stroke, heart failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, peripheral artery dis-
ease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Therefore, the RRs can be interpreted as the proportional
elevation in risk for each outcome experienced by people in
that stage of CKD (or non-CKD) compared with people in
the healthiest group. Across all the heatmaps, a consistent
color scheme is used.

The ﬁgures reveal several common themes and highlight
the necessity of having both eGFR and ACR parameters
available in assessing risk. First, within the CKD popula-
tion, the association of risk for all 10 outcomes increases
with higher stages of both eGFR and albuminuria. The
ﬁgures present only the RRs for each speciﬁc stage and not
the absolute risk of experiencing that outcome for people
in the risk cell. This distinction between relative and ab-
solute risks demonstrates the importance of using indi-
vidual risk prediction tools for persons with CKD, a subject
of Chapter 2.

Although nearly all CKD categories are at substantially
elevated risk for most outcomes in Figure 5, a distinction must be
made for people in the eGFRcr CKD G3a category and with the
lowest ACR severity (<10 mg/g [<1 mg/mmol]). This group is
portrayed in the lower-risk green color for 7 of the 10 outcomes
presented, although they have 3-fold higher adjusted risk of AKI
and 13-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with the
reference
risk association for
inconsistent
populations with CKD G3a, A1, particularly in older adults,
has led to controversy over whether this group should be

never), systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, use of antihypertensive medications,
and a medical history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, peripheral artery disease, cancer, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, where relevant. The colors were determined for each outcome separately using the following rule: the
percentile shaded the darkest green color corresponds to the proportion of cells in the grid without CKD (e.g., 6 of 35 cells with eGFR $60 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 and ACR <30 mg/g [<3 mg/mmol]), and the percentile shaded the darkest red color corresponds to proportion expected to be
at highest risk (e.g., 11 of 35 cells with eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and albumin-to-creatinine ratio 1000þ mg/g [100þ mg/mmol]). In this
manner, the numbers of green and red cells are consistent across outcomes, but the patterns are allowed to differ. ref, reference cell.

repeated all 10 heatmaps using creatinine- and cystatin C–
based eGFR (eGFRcr-cys), in part to evaluate whether the
weaker associations of CKD G3a, A1 with clinical outcomes

were caused by the limitations of the speciﬁc creatinine-based
equation eGFRcr, compared with eGFRcr-cys, which has been
established as a better approximation of measured GFR
(mGFR) than eGFRcr (Figure 612).

CKD staging by eGFRcr-cys and ACR and risk for adverse
events
Within the CKD-PC collaboration, 720,736 individuals had
measures of blood cystatin C in addition to having eGFRcr

and ACR. The replacement of eGFRcr with eGFRcr-cys in the
heatmap led to several changes in the risk distributions. Most
notably, the groups with eGFR category 45–59 ml/min per
1.73 m2 and ACR <10 mg/g [<1 mg/mmol] were moved to

higher risk for all 10 outcomes, and this cell was no longer
labeled green for any of the complications (Figure 6). The
distinction in these risk relationships was further explored

the risk relationships of
eGFRcr and eGFRcr-cys with all the 10 complications. For
inﬂuenced by changes in

exhibited a J-shaped association such that risk increased

more linear associations with each of these complications
throughout its distribution.

105 ml/min per

Based upon the risk relationships of eGFRcr-cys and
ACR categories with all complications, the existing CKD
staging is appropriate among both younger and older
adults.

Some authors have suggested that the GFR threshold for
CKD of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 should be raised to 75 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 for younger adults and lowered to 45 ml/min per
1.73 m2 for older adults.55 In younger adults, the purpose of a
higher GFR threshold reﬂects the longer risk horizon for
younger people, which could lead to higher lifetime CKD
progression risks for a given GFR stage. However,
the
higher lifetime progression risks in younger adults with
GFR 60–89 ml/min per 1.73 m2 can be addressed in their
management without changing the deﬁnition of CKD.

Efforts should be directed at people with higher risk with
GFR levels >60 ml/min per 1.73 m2

to prevent

Among older adults, the ﬁndings of consistently elevated
RR for older adults with CKD G3a, A1, as deﬁned by eGFRcr-
cys, support the inclusion of this large group in the CKD
population. These elevated RRs tell us how much more likely
the outcome is compared with the reference group (eGFR 90–
104 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and ACR <10 mg/g [<1 mg/
mmol]). Crucially, they do not tell us what the overall like-
lihood of the outcome, the absolute risk, is. The absolute risk
for important CKD complications is higher among older than
younger adults at nearly every stage, particularly for CVD,
heart failure, and mortality. Therefore, this population is also
likely to beneﬁt from having their CKD diagnosed, staged,
and treated.

Rationale for using cystatin C containing equations for CKD
staging
The rationale for using cystatin C versus SCr, or a combi-
nation of both, in eGFR equations is that creatinine, which is
directly linked to muscle mass, may be misleading at extremes
of body habitus, or in speciﬁc conditions (spinal cord injuries
and sarcopenia), and that cystatin C is impacted by different
variables (steroid use, thyroid disease, and cancer). Thus,
because neither is a perfect marker to use for estimating

clearance, the combination of the 2 compounds gives more
accurate estimates of GFR when compared with measured
values.

Very low levels of SCr often represent poor health status,
such as frailty or sarcopenia, which limits the production of
creatinine. This biological feature of creatinine (i.e., relation
to muscle mass) has limited its prognostic utility and results
in reducing the risk associations for eGFRcr 45–60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 and elevating risks for eGFRcr >110 ml/min per

1.73 m2. These limitations are not observed when risk is
estimated using eGFRcr-cys or cystatin C–based eGFR
(eGFRcys) (Figure 7).

When comparing GFR estimates using these 2 ﬁltration
markers, risk gradients are consistently stronger for most
outcomes for eGFRcys in comparison with eGFRcr. Therefore,
for the purpose of evaluating the association of eGFR with
outcomes (i.e., projecting prognosis for people with CKD), the
eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys can be considered more accurate.

Summary of recommendation statements and practice
points

Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD

1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD

1.1.1 Detection of CKD

Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin mea-

surement and assessment of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR).

Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria,
or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to conﬁrm presence of CKD.

1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD

Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimated glomer-

ular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be
estimated from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (creatinine and cystatin
C–based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B).

1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity

Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by:

review of past measurements/estimations of GFR;

(i)
(ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and urine microscopic

examinations;

(iii) imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness;
(iv) kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and atrophy;
(v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to CKD;
(vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point.

Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the ﬁnding

could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD).

Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR

if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators.

1.1.4 Evaluation of cause

Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD using clinical context, personal and family history, social and envi-
ronmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic
and pathologic diagnosis (Figure 8).

Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to

evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions when clinically appropriate (2D).

1.2 Evaluation of GFR

1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR
Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR” when referring to the speciﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use the
more general term “kidney function(s)” when dealing with the totality of functions of the kidney.

Figure 11 | Approach to glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests. The algorithm describes the
approach to the evaluation of GFR. The approach uses initial and supportive testing to develop a ﬁnal assessment of true GFR and to apply it in
individual decision-making. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr), which will be available for most
people because creatinine is measured routinely as part of the basic metabolic panel. If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a more
accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then,
if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated. If eGFRcr-cys
is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR should
be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous ﬁltration markers. *Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or
eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants such as changes in muscle
mass or creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of speciﬁc medications. †Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low
muscle mass or very high levels of inﬂammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use. ‡Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in
otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion or
extrarenal elimination due to the use of speciﬁc medications.

Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is less accurate

and GFR affects clinical decision-making (Table 8127-142) (1C).

Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using
plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous ﬁltration marker (Table 9).
Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitations in both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR)

as well as the variability and factors that inﬂuence SCr and cystatin C measurements.

Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires consideration of dietary intake.

Minimal data, suggest eGFRcr may be appropriate if
no changes to non-GFR determinants of SCr or no

populations studied but likelihood of lesser
accuracy in more frail people or in cancers with
high cell turnover. Suggest using mGFR for

Although limited data, eGFRcys appears less biased

but all have low accuracy. Suggest using eGFRcr-

GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate; SCr, serum creatinine.

Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time.
Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C–based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some speciﬁc

circumstances.

Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may be infor-

mative, in both direction and magnitude of those differences.

Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections for measured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and

eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate.

1.2.3 Guidance to clinical laboratories

Practice Point 1.2.3.1: Implement the laboratory standards of care outlined in Table 11 to ensure accuracy and reliability

when assessing GFR using creatinine and cystatin C.

Table 11 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of GFR assessments using creatinine and cystatin C

(cid:3) Report eGFR in addition to the serum concentrations of ﬁltration markers using validated equations.
(cid:3) Report eGFR rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m2 in adults using the units ml/min per 1.73 m2.
(cid:3) Reported eGFR levels <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 should be ﬂagged as being low.
(cid:3) When reporting levels of ﬁltration markers, report:

(i) SCr concentration rounded to the nearest whole number when expressed as standard international units (mmol/l) and rounded to the nearest

100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/dl);

(ii) serum cystatin C concentration rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/l).

(cid:3) Measure ﬁltration markers using a speciﬁc, precise (coefﬁcient of variation [CV] <2.3% for creatinine and <2.0% for cystatin C) assay with calibration
traceable to the international standard reference materials and desirable bias (<3.7% for creatinine and <3.2% for cystatin C) compared with reference
methodology (or appropriate international standard reference method group target in external quality assessment [EQA] for cystatin C).

(cid:3) Use an enzymatic method to assay creatinine, where possible.
(cid:3) Separate serum/plasma from red blood cells by centrifugation within 12 hours of venipuncture.
(cid:3) When cystatin C is measured, measure creatinine on the same sample to enable calculation of eGFRcr-cys.

eGFR, estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate; eGFRcr-cys, estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate based on creatinine and cystatin C; GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate; SCr, serum
creatinine.

Practice Point 1.2.3.2: Given available resources, clinical laboratories may consider the possibility of measurement of both

creatinine and cystatin either as an in-house test or as a referred test.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 1.2.3.3: Laboratories measuring creatinine in infants or small children must ensure their quality control

process include the lowest end of the expected range of values for the group of interest.

Practice Point 1.2.3.4: Consider the consistent use of enzymatic creatinine assays in children, given the higher relative
contribution of non-creatinine chromogens to measured creatinine in children when using the
Jaffe assay, and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samples in the neonatal period.

Practice Point 1.2.3.5: An eGFRcr level <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 can be ﬂagged as “low” in children and adolescents over the

age of 2 years.

1.2.4 Selection of GFR estimating equations

Recommendation 1.2.4.1: We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum
ﬁltration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum ﬁltration markers alone (1D).

Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within geographical regions (as deﬁned locally [e.g., continent, country,
region] and as large as possible). Within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children.

Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of eGFR should be avoided.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children using validated equations that have been developed or validated in

comparable populations.

1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria

1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers

Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of pref-
erence). In all cases, a ﬁrst void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and
children.

(i) urine ACR, or
(ii) reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading.

If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements:

(i) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR),
(ii) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or
(iii) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading.

Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods.

(cid:3) Conﬁrm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory mea-
surement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (i.e., quantify the ACR or
PCR if initial semiquantitative tests are positive).

(cid:3) Conﬁrm ACR ‡30 mg/g (‡3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent ﬁrst

morning void in the morning midstream urine sample.

Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine

creatinine and order conﬁrmatory tests as indicated (Table 16).

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a ﬁrst morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria

(in descending order of preference):

(i) Both urine PCR and urine ACR,
(ii) Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading, or
(iii) Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading.

1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories

Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure accuracy

and reliability of the ﬁndings when assessing urine samples.

Table 17 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of urine samples

(cid:3) Samples for albumin measurement analyzed fresh or stored at 4 (cid:4)C for up to 7 days
(cid:3) Samples for albumin measurement should not be stored frozen at (cid:5)20 (cid:4)C
(cid:3) Report ACR in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone
(cid:3) Reporting to 1 decimal place for ACR whether mg/mmol or mg/g
(cid:3) Analytical CV of methods to measure urine albumin should be <15%.
ACR, albumin-to-creatinine ratio; CV, coefﬁcient of variation.

Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creati-

nine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories.

1.4 Point-of-care testing

Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of-care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and urine

albumin measurement where access to a laboratory is limited or providing a test at the
point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C).

Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same pre-
analytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and perfor-
mance of the device, including external quality assessment, and the interpretation of the result is used.

Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use the

equation consistent with that used within the region.

Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing
creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices to
produce a positive result in 85% of people with signiﬁcant albuminuria (ACR ‡30 mg/g or ‡3 mg/
mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device.

Chapter 2: Risk assessment in people with CKD

2.1 Overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories

Practice Point 2.1.1: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in

people with CKD.

Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression

when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions.

Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected

variability and warrants evaluation.

Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of

>30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation.

Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test

exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

2.2 Risk prediction in people with CKD

Recommendation 2.2.1: In people with CKD G3–G5, we recommend using an externally validated risk equation

to estimate the absolute risk of kidney failure (1A).

Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3%–5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in

Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care

addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other clinical considerations.

in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations.

Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of >40% can be used to determine the modality education,
timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or
referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations.

Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3–G5, may not

be valid for use in those with CKD G1–G2.

Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speciﬁc, externally validated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin

A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with CKD

Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use
externally validated models that are either developed within CKD populations or that incor-
porate eGFR and albuminuria.

Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide discussions about goals of care, use externally validated

models that predict all-cause mortality speciﬁcally developed in the CKD population.

3.2 Lifestyle factors

Practice Point 3.2.1: Encourage people with CKD to undertake physical activity compatible with cardiovascular
health, tolerance, and level of frailty; achieve an optimal body mass index (BMI); and not to use
tobacco products. Referral to providers and programs (e.g., psychologists, renal dietitians or
accredited nutrition providers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapy, and smoking
cessation programs) should be offered where indicated and available.

3.2.2 Physical activity and optimum weight
The Work Group concurs with all the recommendation and practice points relating to physical activity from the KDIGO 2022
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23 and considers that they should extend to all
adults with CKD. We draw attention to the following statements:

Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that people with CKD be advised to undertake moderate-intensity
physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes per week, or to a
level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (1D).

Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical activity should consider age, ethnic background, presence of other

comorbidities, and access to resources.
Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised to avoid sedentary behavior.

Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensity of physical

activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and the type of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both).

Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD to undertake physical activity aiming for World Health Organization
(WHO)-advised levels (i.e., ‡60 minutes daily) and to achieve a healthy weight.

3.3 Diet
Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based

foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods.

Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about dietary
adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potassium, and protein intake, tailored to their indi-
vidual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions.

3.3.1 Protein intake

Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults with

CKD G3–G5 (2C).

Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake (>1.3 g/kg body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression.
Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, consider
prescribing, under close supervision, a very low–protein diet (0.3–0.4 g/kg body weight/d) sup-
plemented with essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kg body weight/d).

Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low–protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake in children with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment. The
target protein and energy intake in children with CKD G2–G5 should be at the upper end of the
normal range for healthy children to promote optimal growth.

Older adults.

Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlying conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higher protein

and calorie dietary targets.

3.3.2 Sodium intake
The Work Group concurs with the following recommendation from KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes
Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23 and the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood
Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.21

Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium

per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD (2C).

Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based Recommended Daily Intake when counseling about sodium intake for children with

CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height.

3.4 Blood pressure control
The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic
Kidney Disease, which encourages individualized BP targets and the use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, and other
comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and tolerance to treatments.21 We highlight the following guidance:

Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure

(SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized ofﬁce BP measurement (2B).

Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures,

very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural hypotension.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic
Kidney Disease, and we highlight the following guidance21:

Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by

ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be lowered to £50th percentile
for age, sex, and height (2C).

Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM and every 3–6 months with standardized auscultatory ofﬁce

BP in children with CKD.

Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatory
ofﬁce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting, of 50th–75th percentile for age, sex, and
height unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptoms of hypotension.

3.5 Glycemic control
Please refer to the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease for speciﬁc
recommendations, practice points, and research recommendations.

3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors

Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease and selected practice points for treatment with RASi from the KDIGO 2021 Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease21 and the KDIGO 2022 Clinical
Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management
several
recommendations to apply even in the absence of high BP and has adapted the recommendations from the BP guideline to
remove this requirement. Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted:

in Chronic Kidney Disease.23 The Work Group considers

Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people
with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A3) without diabetes (1B).

Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increased

albuminuria (G1–G4, A2) without diabetes (2C).

Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately-to-

severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B).

Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor

(DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B).

s u m m a r y o f r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s t a t e m e n t s a n d p r a c t i c e p o i n t s

Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to
achieve the beneﬁts described because the proven beneﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses.
Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of
initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.

Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum

potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi.

Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks

following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose.

Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hy-
potension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms
while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2).
Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or

ARB) for speciﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction).

Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)
The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney
Disease, which stated: “We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per
1.73 m2 with an SGLT2i (1A).”23 However, in the present guideline, we offer a more general 1A recommendation for adults with
CKD. We also highlight practice points from the KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management in CKD, which are also
relevant for people with CKD without diabetes:

Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/

min per 1.73 m2 with an SGLT2i (1A).

Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below

20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated.

Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical

illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis).

Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A):
(cid:3) eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urine ACR ‡200 mg/g (‡20 mg/mmol), or
(cid:3) heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria.

Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the

reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.

Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urine ACR

<200 mg/g (<20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B).

3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)
The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice points from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.23

Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney
or cardiovascular beneﬁt for adults with T2D, an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, normal
serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria (>30 mg/g [>3 mg/mmol]) despite
maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A).

Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progression
and cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care
therapies.

Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD in adults.

Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia, select people with consistently normal serum potassium concen-
tration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA (Figure 26).

K+ ≤4.8 mmol/l

K+ 4.9–5.5 mmol/l

K+ >5.5 mmol/l

• Initiate finerenone
  - 10 mg daily if eGFR 25–59 ml/min/1.73 m2
  - 20 mg daily if eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2
• Monitor K+ at 1 month after initiation and then every 4
  months
• Increase dose to 20 mg daily, if on 10 mg daily
• Restart 10 mg daily if previously held for hyperkalemia and
  K+ now ≤5.0 mmol/l

• Continue finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg
• Monitor K+ every 4 months

• Hold finerenone
• Consider adjustments to diet or concomitant
  medications to mitigate hyperkalemia
• Recheck K+
• Consider reinitiation if/when K+ ≤5.0 mmol/l

(ﬁnerenone). Adapted from the protocols of Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-
DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD). The Work Group considers
these potassium thresholds to be conservative, and it may be considered appropriate to continue MRAs in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/
l. This algorithm could be used for steroidal MRA. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved initiation of Kþ < 5.0 mmol/l. This
ﬁgure is guided by trial design and the FDA label and may be different in other countries. Serum creatinine/estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR) should be monitored concurrently with serum potassium. Reproduced from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Diabetes Work
Group. KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease. Kidney Int. 2022;102:S1–S127.23

Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or

cardiovascular beneﬁts.

Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory
hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular ﬁltration, particularly
among people with a low GFR.

3.9 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA)
The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice point from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.23

Recommendation 3.9.1: In adults with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets
despite use of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, or who are unable to use
those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B).

Practice Point 3.9.1:

The choice of GLP-1 RA should prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular beneﬁts.

3.10 Metabolic acidosis

Practice Point 3.10.1:

In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary
intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., serum
bicarbonate <18 mmol/l in adults).

Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate
concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control,
serum potassium, or ﬂuid status.

3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD

3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium measurement
Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of potassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and mech-
anisms that may inﬂuence potassium measurement including diurnal and seasonal variation,
plasma versus serum samples, and the actions of medications.

3.11.2 Potassium exchange agents
Practice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologic man-

agement of nonemergent hyperkalemia.

3.11.4 Managing hyperkalemia
[No recommendations and practice points]

3.11.5 Dietary considerations
Practice Point 3.11.5.1: Implement an individualized approach in people with CKD G3–G5 and emergent hyperkalemia that
includes dietary and pharmacologic interventions and takes into consideration associated comor-
bidities and quality of life (QoL). Assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited
nutrition provider are advised.

Practice Point 3.11.5.2: Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods)
for people with CKD G3–G5 who have a history of hyperkalemia or as a prevention strategy
during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

3.12 Anemia

Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease–Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD).20 Please refer to this publication for speciﬁc
recommendations, selection, dosing of speciﬁc therapeutic agents, and research recommendations.

3.14 Hyperuricemia

Recommendation 3.14.1: We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered

uric acid–lowering intervention (1C).

Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid–lowering therapy for people with CKD after their ﬁrst episode of gout
(particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is >9 mg/dl
[535 mmol/l]).

Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and

symptomatic hyperuricemia.

Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glu-
cocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Dietary approaches.

Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventions which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol, meats, and

high-fructose corn syrup intake.

Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and

asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D).

3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional speciﬁc interventions to modify risk

3.15.1 Lipid management
The beneﬁts of lowering LDL cholesterol using statin-based therapies on the risk of ASCVD are well established in people with
and without CKD. There are clear recommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out in the KDIGO Clinical Practice
Guideline for Lipid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.19 The Work Group concurs with all the recommendations in this
guideline. In particular, we draw attention to:

Recommendation 3.15.1.1:

Recommendation 3.15.1.2:

Recommendation 3.15.1.3:

In adults aged ‡50 years with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 but not treated with
chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a–G5), we recom-
mend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A).
In adults aged ‡50 years with CKD and eGFR ‡60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (GFR cate-
gories G1–G2), we recommend treatment with a statin (1B).
In adults aged 18–49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney
transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the
following (2A):
(cid:3) known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization),
(cid:3) diabetes mellitus,
(cid:3) prior ischemic stroke, or
(cid:3) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction

>10%.

Practice Point 3.15.1.1: Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool.
Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin-based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-

density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largest treatment beneﬁts.

Practice Point 3.15.1.3: In adults with CKD aged 18–49, a lower (i.e., <10%) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death
or nonfatal myocardial infarction may also be appropriate thresholds for initiation of statin-based
therapy.

Practice Point 3.15.1.4: Consider prescribing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors to people

Dietary approaches.

with CKD who have an indication for their use.

Practice Point 3.15.1.5: Consider a plant-based “Mediterranean-style” diet in addition to lipid-modifying therapy to reduce

3.15.2 Use of antiplatelet therapy

cardiovascular risk.

Recommendation 3.15.2.1: We recommend oral low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemic cardio-

vascular disease events (i.e., secondary prevention) in people with CKD and
established ischemic cardiovascular disease (1C).

Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g., P2Y12 inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance.

3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary artery disease

Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable stress-test conﬁrmed ischemic heart disease, an initial
conservative approach using intensive medical therapy is an appropriate alterna-
tive to an initial invasive strategy (2D).

Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an invasive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKD with
acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levels of angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left
ventricular systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main disease.

3.16 CKD and atrial ﬁbrillation
Practice Point 3.16.1: Follow established strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation (Figure 40).

 Step 1
Diagnosis

Step 2
Prophylaxis against
stroke and systemic
thromboembolism

• In people with CKD, use opportunistic pulse-based screening (e.g., taking at when measuring BP), followed by a

  wearable device or Holter ECG testing

  (they are likely to have an increased CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor for stroke and are at high risk even with a score of 0–1)

  managed (e.g., alcohol advice, use of a proton pump inhibitor) 

†

Step 3
Rate/rhythm control

• Use medical therapy (e.g., beta blockade) to control ventricular rate to less than about 90 bpm at rest to decrease
  symptoms and related complications
• For people with persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control, consider rhythm control with cardioversion,
  antiarrhythmic therapy and/or catheter ablation 

Figure 40 | Strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial ﬁbrillation. *Consider dose adjustments necessary in people with
chronic kidney disease (CKD). †The following has been recommended as a standard package for diagnostic evaluation of new atrial ﬁbrillation:
(i) a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to establish the diagnosis, assess ventricular rate, and check for the presence of conduction defects,
ischemia, or structural heart disease; (ii) laboratory testing for thyroid and kidney function, serum electrolytes, and full blood count; and (iii)
transthoracic echocardiography to assess left ventricular size and function, left atrial size, for valvular disease, and right heart size and function.

Age 65 to 74, and Sex category (female); HAS-BLED, Hypertension, Abnormal liver/kidney function, Stroke history, Bleeding history or
predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio (INR), Elderly, Drug/alcohol usage.

Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in

preference to vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) for thromboprophylaxis in atrial
ﬁbrillation in people with CKD G1–G4 (1C).

Practice Point 3.16.2: NOAC dose adjustment for GFR is required, with caution needed at CKD G4–G5.
Practice Point 3.16.3: Duration of NOAC discontinuation before elective procedures needs to consider procedural bleeding

risk, NOAC prescribed, and level of GFR (Figure 44).

Chapter 4: Medication management and drug stewardship in CKD

4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety

Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. When prescribing

such medications to people with CKD, always consider the beneﬁts versus potential harms.

Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and therapeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people with CKD
receiving medications with narrow therapeutic windows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity,
both in outpatient practice and in hospital settings.

Practice Point 4.1.3: Review and limit the use of over-the-counter medicines and dietary or herbal remedies that may be

harmful for people with CKD.

Medications and pregnancy.

Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications to people with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, always review
teratogenicity potential and provide regular reproductive and contraceptive counseling in accordance
with the values and preferences of the person with CKD.

4.2 Dose adjustments by level of GFR

Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications cleared by the kidneys.
Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings, validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate for drug

dosing.

Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow ther-
apeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable,
use of equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR may be indicated.

s u m m a r y o f r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s t a t e m e n t s a n d p r a c t i c e p o i n t s

Practice Point 4.2.4:

Practice Point 4.2.5:

In people with extremes of body weight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) may be
indicated, especially for medications with a narrow therapeutic range or requiring a minimum
concentration to be effective.
Consider and adapt drug dosing in people where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the ﬁltration
markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state.

4.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship
Practice Point 4.3.1:

Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence,
continued indication, and potential drug interactions because people with CKD often have complex
medication regimens and are seen by multiple specialists.

Practice Point 4.3.2:

If medications are discontinued during an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when to restart
the discontinued medications to the affected person and healthcare providers, and ensure docu-
mentation in the medical record.

Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation of medications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i) in
the 48–72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the acute management of adverse effects as a
precautionary measure to prevent complications. However, note that failure to restart these medi-
cations after the event or procedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point 4.3.2).

4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship
Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with CKD regarding the expected beneﬁts and possible risks of medi-

cations so that they can identify and report adverse events that can be managed.

Practice Point 4.3.1.2: Establish collaborative relationships with other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/or
use tools to ensure and improve drug stewardship in people with CKD to enhance management
of their complex medication regimens.

4.4 Imaging studies
Practice Point 4.4.1: Consider the indication for imaging studies in accordance with general population in-
dications. Risks and beneﬁts of imaging studies should be determined on an individual
basis in the context of their CKD.

4.4.1 Radiocontrast: intra-arterial and intravenous dye studies
Practice Point 4.4.1.1: Assess the risk for AKI in people with CKD receiving intra-arterial contrast for cardiac pro-

cedures using validated tools.

Practice Point 4.4.1.2: The intravenous administration of radiocontrast media can be managed in accordance with
consensus statements from the radiology societies in people with AKI or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73
m2 (CKD G3a–G5) undergoing elective investigation.

4.4.2 Gadolinium-containing contrast media
Practice Point 4.4.2.1: For people with GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (CKD G4–G5) who require gadolinium-containing

contrast media, preferentially offer them American College of Radiology group II and III
gadolinium-based contrast agents.

Practice Point 5.3.1.2.3: Assess young people with CKD more frequently than older people with the same stage of CKD and,
with the agreement of the young person, include the caregivers or signiﬁcant other of the young
person in their care, at least in the ﬁrst 1–3 years following transfer from pediatric care (Figure 55).

5.4 Timing the initiation of dialysis
Practice Point 5.4.1: Initiate dialysis based on a composite assessment of a person’s symptoms, signs, QoL, preferences,

level of GFR, and laboratory abnormalities.

Practice Point 5.4.2: Initiate dialysis if the presence of one or more of the following situations is evident (Table 41).

This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

Practice Point 5.4.3: Consider planning for preemptive kidney transplantation and/or dialysis access in adults when the
GFR is <15–20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or risk of KRT is >40% over 2 years.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 5.4.4: In children, in addition to the adult indications for dialysis, poor growth refractory to optimized

nutrition, growth hormone, and medical management is an indication for initiating KRT.

Practice Point 5.4.5: Pursue living or deceased donor preemptive kidney transplantation as the treatment of choice for
children in whom there is evidence of progressive and irreversible CKD. The eGFR at which pre-
emptive transplantation should be undertaken will depend on multiple factors including the age and
size of the child and the rate of progression of kidney failure but will usually be between 5–15 ml/min
per 1.73 m2.

5.5 Structure and process of supportive care and comprehensive conservative management

Practice Point 5.5.1: Inform people with CKD about the options for KRT and comprehensive conservative care.
Practice Point 5.5.2: Support comprehensive conservative management as an option for people who choose not to pursue

KRT.

Practice Point 5.5.3: Provide access to resources that enable the delivery of advanced care planning for people with a
recognized need for end-of-life care, including those people undergoing comprehensive conservative
care.

Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD

1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD

Both decreased GFR and increased albuminuria or other
markers of kidney damage are often silent and not apparent to
the person at risk of CKD or the healthcare provider unless
laboratory tests are performed. The cause of the decreased GFR
or increased albuminuria may also not be apparent. In the
decade since the publication of the previous KDIGO Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of
Chronic Kidney Disease,1 there have been substantial advances
in treatment for CKD of all causes (Chapter 3), targeted
therapies for speciﬁc causes of CKD (e.g., KDIGO 2021
Clinical
of
Glomerular Diseases22), as well as understanding of and
methods to determine the etiology of CKD. All together, these
advances have the potential to slow and possibly prevent the
progression of kidney disease. Thus, in this section of Chapter
1, we emphasize the importance of detecting CKD, and
considerations for the optimal methods for staging of CKD,
and how to establish chronicity and etiology.

1.1.1 Detection of CKD

Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement
and assessment of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR).

Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD,
provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treat-
ments can be initiated earlier in the disease course. Because
treatments for CKD provide beneﬁts in reducing risk for both
CVD and CKD progression, strategies that promote early
detection of CKD should improve kidney and non–kidney-
related outcomes. Even if medical treatments are not available
or indicated for an individual, there are recommended lifestyle
changes that could be implemented after the diagnosis of CKD
(Chapter 3). Interviews with people who have CKD have pro-
vided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if they
received a diagnosis of CKD.17 Knowledge of
level of
albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions
beyond initiating treatments speciﬁcally for CKD (Table 4).
Each of these is considered in greater depth in the subsequent
chapters. Finally,
form of kidney disease is
suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person may
allow detection in other family members. Thus, initial testing
of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with
conﬁrmatory testing if initial ﬁndings indicate the presence of
abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria.

if a familial

From a societal perspective, early identiﬁcation of and
intervention for CKD could have a positive impact on health
disparities. In many countries, there is a higher incidence of CKD
among people with lower SES, and these people are more likely
to progress to kidney failure and have less access to KRT (dialysis

and transplantation).56 A public health approach toward CKD
detection and treatment could reduce inequities in the burden
of kidney failure by slowing the rate of progression and the
risk of CVD for everyone.57

The possible harm of early detection of CKD is that the
new diagnosis may cause anxiety in some people, particularly
if the testing is not discussed in advance of the results. Dis-
cussions around disease detection are common in the primary
care setting, and shared decision-making is an established
practice through which people may agree to the testing,
conﬁrm that they would like to be tested, and prepare for the
range of possible results and their implications.58–60 Early
detection increases burden and costs associated with physi-
cian visits or treatments, and this may not be balanced by
savings from averting adverse outcomes.

CKD ﬁts the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for
an early detection program.61–63 Given that chronic disease
detection and prevention frameworks have been deployed for
other disease and risk factor conditions, in our view, CKD
detection strategies should be implemented for high-risk people.
A framework has been developed for communities to align
CKD detection and treatment strategies within their broader
public health priorities to ensure that the goals of the interven-
tion are achieved without compromising other valuable health
initiatives.26 Both the efﬁcacy and the cost-effectiveness of CKD
detection and treatment interventions will depend upon the
speciﬁc strategies that are employed in the healthcare system.
Therefore,
should be
from future clinical
evaluated within their unique context and may not generalize
to all CKD detection efforts.

results

trials

Most people with or at risk for CKD, healthcare providers, and
policy makers would wish to identify CKD. Most people who are
already receiving medical care would choose case-ﬁnding stra-
tegies to enable earlier risk stratiﬁcation and treatment for pre-
viously undiagnosed CKD.17,64 Thus, the application of earlier
treatment to delay CKD progression in people with CKD is of
a higher priority than the lack of clinical trial evidence that
case-ﬁnding strategies themselves improve outcomes.

This practice point promoting CKD detection efforts may
have implications for health equity, because CKD dispro-
portionately affects people from minoritized populations and
those who have lower SES. The increasing availability and
evidence supporting several treatments for CKD advocates for
early disease detection. Given the asymptomatic progression
of CKD, systematic testing of people with risk factors for
CKD is the only method that would detect CKD at early
stages and allow the initiation of appropriate treatments.
CKD detection could reduce the proportion of people with
CKD who will experience the morbidity of CKD G4–G5.
Cost-effectiveness analyses, performed in the new era of
effective disease-modifying therapies, describe a more positive
view of population-wide screening.27

Figure 328 provides an algorithm for the identiﬁcation of
people at risk for CKD testing in those at risk, further
testing in those identiﬁed as having CKD to conﬁrm stages,

and subsequently allowing for treatment initiation. Primary
care physicians or other medical specialists who care for
people with risk factors for CKD, such as endocrinology,
cardiology, or
for an
rheumatology, are ideal

time. For T1D,

The highest priority conditions for CKD detection are
hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, including heart failure. For
diabetes, the ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening
of people with diabetes for CKD.29 CKD screening should
start at diagnosis of T2D because evidence of CKD is often
already apparent at
screening is
recommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. A
second important group includes people with recent AKI or
acute kidney disease (AKD), particularly multiple episodes
of AKI, and those who have been “partially diagnosed” with
CKD by either eGFR or albuminuria but cannot be fully
staged. Other groups who might be considered for CKD
testing are shown in Table 5. This list is not exhaustive and
may be modiﬁed by local epidemiological considerations. As
per above, 2023 analyses suggest that population screening
may in fact be cost-effective, obviating the need for
“selecting” and addressing an ever-changing list of “at risk”
groups.27

Testing for CKD without regard to age generates contro-
versy. Those in older age groups experience the greatest
burden of CKD and are also at the highest risk for cardio-
vascular complications. As with other detection programs like
cancer detection, CKD detection efforts should be individu-
alized based on the person’s goals of care and suitability for
treatment.

Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of
elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), he-
maturia, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to
conﬁrm presence of CKD.

There is known biological and analytical variability in SCr
and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to their
properties as markers of kidney disease. In people without
risk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for
CKD. Thus, any unexpected results should be veriﬁed before
diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk
factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the person
does have CKD even with an unexpected ﬁnding. Subsequent
testing should be performed to conﬁrm the diagnosis and to
complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeat
sample should be determined based on clinical setting
including risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/
AKD.

Hematuria is common and associated with risk for sub-
sequent development of CKD.65 There are several causes of

equations using both creatinine and cystatin C afford greater
accuracy in comparison with either ﬁltration marker alone. The
recommendation places a lower value on the resource utilization
and cost associated with the assessment of eGFRcr-cys.

Special considerations

Key information

Pediatric considerations. People who are born preterm,
especially if also small for gestational age, are at increased risk
for CKD and kidney failure. This is largely related to
decreased nephron number.68–70 Additional insults after birth
such as neonatal AKI and childhood obesity can further in-
crease the risk of CKD.71,72

1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD

Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD,
we recommend using creatinine-based estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is
available, the GFR category should be estimated
from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C
(creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated glomer-
ular ﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B).

For the diagnosis and staging of CKD by GFR, this recom-
mendation puts a high value on data suggesting that the most
accurate method of estimating GFR is by using 2 biomarkers
(cystatin C and creatinine), as each has limitations and beneﬁts
as ﬁltration markers. As compared with mGFR, estimating

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. In the CKD-PC collabora-
tion, 720,736 people had measures of blood cystatin C in addi-
tion to having eGFRcr and ACR.12 Replacing the assessment of
eGFRcr with eGFRcr-cys in the matrix of GFR categories led
to several changes in the risk distributions. Most notably, the
group with an eGFR category 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and
ACR <10 mg/g (<1 mg/mmol) was moved to higher risk for
all 10 outcomes, and this category was no longer labeled
as being low-risk (“green”) for any of the complications
(Figure 612). For the 8 outcomes that are not inﬂuenced by
changes in creatinine (i.e. all except kidney failure and AKI),
eGFRcr exhibited a J-shaped association such that risk
increased with eGFR values >105 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(Figure 712). In contrast eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much
more linear associations with each of these complications
throughout its distribution. These data demonstrate that the
combined eGFRcr-cys equation is superior for distinguishing
GFR risk stages compared with eGFRcr.

Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on 2
broadly different types of data—data comparing the accuracy
(P30) of equations from a combination of creatinine and
cystatin C as ﬁltration markers and creatinine and cystatin C

Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314

alone and data from the CKD-PC examining the risk of
outcome by GFR stage assessed by eGFRcr compared with
eGFRcr-cys. As compared with equations based on creatinine
and cystatin C alone, the equation using both creatinine and
to mGFR most consistently
cystatin C comes closest
(Supplementary Table S373–96). The CKD-PC data were an
individual-level data analysis of 27,503,140 participants
from 114 global cohorts (eGFRcr) and 720,736 participants
from 20 cohorts (eGFRcr-cys) and 9,067,753 participants
from 114 cohorts (albuminuria) from 1980 to 2021 from
around the world conveying a high degree of robustness in
the association of CKD stage with a broad range of adverse
outcomes. Based on the totality and consistency of
the
CKD-PC data, the overall certainty of the evidence was
rated as moderate.

Values and preferences. This recommendation places a high
value on the need for the most accurate assessment of GFR.
The Work Group judged that many people at risk for CKD
would prefer an accurate measurement when conﬁrming the
diagnosis of CKD and its staging. For this reason, the Work
Group prioritized eGFRcr-cys over eGFRcr or eGFRcys for
the most accurate measurement. The recommendation puts a
low value on the availability and cost of an assessment of
eGFRcr-cys suggesting that people at risk of CKD would opt
for the more accurate assessment.

Resource use and costs. The costs and resource use associ-
ated with eGFRcr-cys are currently greater than those of
eGFRcr; however, the need for an accurate measurement may
offset these expenses. In addition, accurate diagnosis of CKD
as early as possible may lead to lower resource utilization and
healthcare spending than if diagnosed in later stages of CKD.
For more information on the costs associated with cystatin C
assessments, please refer to Section 1.2.2.

Considerations for implementation. The biggest consideration
for implementation is the availability of cystatin C measurement.
For this reason, the recommendation includes the alternative for
eGFRcr in such cases taking into consideration the limitations
and drawbacks of creatinine-based measurements.

Rationale
The KDIGO CKD staging system based on 2 dimensions,
GFR and albuminuria, was created largely to reﬂect the as-
sociation of outcomes of people with CKD, relative to the
earlier staging systems based solely on GFR stages. Assessment
of GFR stage is ideally performed using accurate assessment
of GFR and ACR and is used to best capture the prognosis for
people with CKD with regard to outcomes such as kidney
failure, CVD, and mortality risk. There is now a large evi-
dence base demonstrating that the use of eGFRcr-cys reclas-
siﬁes a large proportion of the population into different GFR
stages and the “new” stages better reﬂect their risk associa-
tions. For that reason, where available, cystatin C should be
added to creatinine for the purpose of estimating GFR for
CKD diagnosis and staging.

1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity

Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a
minimum of 3 months) can be established by:

review of past measurements/estimations of GFR;

(i)
(ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or
proteinuria and urine microscopic examinations;
(iii) imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and

reduction in cortical thickness;

(iv) kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and

atrophy;

(v) medical history, especially conditions known to

cause or contribute to CKD;

(vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-

month point.

Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity based
upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the
ﬁnding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury
(AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD).

Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for
CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated
ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other
clinical indicators.

(such as acute glomerulonephritis

Kidney diseases may be acute or chronic.1,97 We explicitly
yet arbitrarily deﬁne the duration of a minimum of 3 months
(>90 days) as delineating “chronic” kidney disease. The
rationale for deﬁning chronicity is to differentiate CKD
from AKDs
[GN]),
including AKI, which may require different timelines for
initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have
different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney
disease may be documented or inferred based on the
clinical context. For example, a person with decreased GFR
or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior
documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have
AKD. Resolution over days to weeks would conﬁrm the
diagnosis of AKI from a variety of different causes. A
person with similar ﬁndings in the absence of an acute
illness may be inferred to have CKD, and if followed over
time, would be conﬁrmed to have CKD. In both cases,

recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging. The
timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with
earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and
later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD.

ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage

For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diag-
nosis for the sake of conﬁrming chronicity can delay
care. Many people may not recognize the importance of
a repeat visit if treatment had not been initiated. Thus,
initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention
and also indicates
the
disease.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. Newborns who clearly have kidney
disease (e.g., severe congenital malformations of the kidney and
urinary tract) do not need to wait 3 months to conﬁrm CKD.

1.1.4 Evaluation of cause

Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD using
clinical context, personal and family history, social and
environmental factors, medications, physical examination,
laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologic
diagnosis (Figure 8).

Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause based
on resources available (Table 622,98-100).

In evaluation of cause, healthcare providers should select
speciﬁc diagnostic tests based on the pretest probability of a
speciﬁc diagnosis informed by clinical presentation. Identiﬁca-
tion of cause confers beneﬁt for targeting therapy to slow pro-
gression to kidney failure, understanding contributing factors,
and prognosis. In addition, identiﬁcation of cause can help
people communicate information about a genetic or familial
cause to relatives, improve understanding of their condition in
the context of self-care management, and improve health literacy.
Genetic testing is emerging as a valuable component for
evaluation of cause. In some studies, >10% of people with
CKD, regardless of family history, were observed to carry
genetic pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant(s) that
represent a plausible molecular cause for the development or
progression of CKD.101–103 In some cases, identiﬁcation of
the
actionable genes through genetic testing can impact
clinical management of people with CKD (Figure 9100).104,105
The prevalence of genetic causes to CKD is expected to
increase in future years through increased recognition.

A recent KDIGO Controversies Conference listed the following
recommendations for when genetic testing can be particularly

multisystem features, (iv) consanguinity, (v) possibility of iden-
tifying a condition amenable to targeted treatment, and (vi) CKD/
kidney failure of unknown etiology when kidney biopsy would not
be informative due to advanced disease.100

The KDIGO Controversies Conference also highlighted
the importance of an educated workforce with expertise in
kidney genetics, genomics, and computational research for
appropriate use and interpretation of
these tests (Figure
10100). Access to genetic counseling and medical genetics is
important
support, appropriate use of
genetic testing, and to limit costs.102

for psychosocial

Most people with a new diagnosis of CKD and their
healthcare providers would prefer to undertake evaluation for
the underlying cause to ensure that the best possible care is
provided. Although some people identiﬁed as having CKD
may prefer not to undergo the (sometimes invasive) pro-
cedures to evaluate cause, establishing cause enables the most
appropriate management strategy to be implemented.

Resources available for evaluation of cause will vary
worldwide. People may not be able to pay for some diagnostic
tests. Therefore, healthcare providers should tailor the eval-
uation of cause based on these resource constraints (e.g.,
urine protein reagent strip testing instead of ACR).

Education on the value of establishing a diagnosis of CKD
is critical. This can be done through local, national, and in-
ternational kidney societies and within healthcare training
programs (Chapter 5). Additional resources may be required
to support wider scale implementation of diagnostic tests,
especially genetic testing, availability of biopsies, and the
support required for implementation.

Identiﬁcation of cause is often achieved by standard clin-
ical methods (i.e., history and examination), knowledge of the
causes of CKD and their manifestations (i.e., level of GFR and
speciﬁc marker of kidney damage such as hematuria, urine
albumin, or cysts), together with specialized investigations
(Figure 8). Not all evaluations of cause are required in all
people. Information from the clinical context and initial
tests may lead to further evaluations (Table 6), which are
likely to be conducted as part of specialized kidney care
services and dependent on resources (Chapter 5).

Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a
kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test
to evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions
when clinically appropriate (2D).

This recommendation places a high value on an acceptable safety
proﬁle of kidney biopsies when used to evaluate the cause of
CKD and to plan appropriate treatment.

The harms include the possibility of complications of the
the obtaining of a non-
procedure (bleeding risk/pain),
diagnostic or insufﬁcient sample (wasted resource), and the
anxiety induced while awaiting the results.

The systematic review performed by the ERT identiﬁed 37
studies assessing the prognostic beneﬁt and safety of kidney
biopsy among people with CKD. Ten studies examined the
diagnostic and/or prognostic beneﬁt of kidney biopsy or in-
ﬂuence of biopsy results on management decisions. The
diagnostic ﬁndings were heterogeneous and variable, which
did not lend themselves to further synthesis. The rate of

mortality after native kidney biopsy in people with suspected
or diagnosed CKD was low. Across the 15 studies that re-
ported on mortality after a native kidney biopsy, there were 3
reported deaths. The rate of perirenal hematoma across 14
studies was estimated to be 16% (95% conﬁdence interval
[CI]: 12%–22%). No studies reported on retroperitoneal
hemorrhage (Supplementary Table S4106–126).

Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of evidence for
kidney biopsy and outcomes of harms is very low (Supplementary
Table S4106–126). The critical outcomes, mortality and perirenal
hematomas, were primarily assessed in observational studies
without a comparison group. Because of the potential for
confounding, the ERT considered the body of evidence to have

serious study limitations. The certainty of the evidence for
mortality was further downgraded because there were few
events reported. The certainty of the evidence for perirenal
hematomas was downgraded because there was signiﬁcant
statistical heterogeneity in the results across studies. The ERT
did not identify any studies that reported on the critical
outcome of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that many
people with CKD would choose to undergo a kidney biopsy
to establish the cause of their CKD more accurately and
potentially offer prognostic information. Thus, this recom-
mendation puts a high value on the speciﬁcity of a kidney
biopsy for the evaluation of cause as well as the very low
certainty evidence demonstrating a low risk of complications
associated with kidney biopsy. Because the potential that the
information gleaned from the biopsy may not directly or
immediately beneﬁt the person, the Work Group judged that
some people may prefer to decline a kidney biopsy. The de-
cision to pursue biopsy should be a shared decision and be
informed by probability of and utility of the information
obtained on both diagnostic and prognostic fronts.

Resource use and costs. Resources available for evaluation
of cause will vary worldwide and is dependent on the
healthcare systems. People with CKD may not be able to pay
for biopsy or afford the time away from work for the pro-
cedure. Resources in speciﬁc countries may not permit
appropriate analysis of the obtained samples. Thus, healthcare
providers’ decisions to perform a kidney biopsy in the pres-
ence of limited resources may therefore be inﬂuenced based
on expected yield for that individual and the perceived value
of the extra information gained.

Considerations for implementation. To optimize beneﬁt and
safety, a standardized approach for kidney biopsy with a
vetted and standardized operating protocol designed for local
implementation is warranted. Of note, most studies reported
using ultrasound-guided biopsies and older literature sug-
gesting higher bleeding rates were conducted in the absence
of guided biopsies; thus, we might infer that there is a po-
tential for higher rate of harms in “blind”/unguided biopsies.

Rationale
Kidney biopsy is an important part of the investigations for
the cause of CKD. It is often deferred because of the potential
for harm or lack of recognition of potential utility. The evi-
dence to support safety of biopsy is heterogeneous and
therefore uncertain, but in the studies evaluated, appears to
confer low risk of harm, supporting our suggestion that
kidney biopsies should be considered when it is thought that
facilitate
they can provide information to identify cause,
prognostication, and inform treatment strategies.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. Children and young people with
kidney failure are more likely to have a genetic cause of their
disease than adults. In some healthcare settings, genetic
testing may be pursued ﬁrst, obviating the need for kidney
biopsy and the associated risks, which may be different in
children than adults.

1.2 Evaluation of GFR
The kidney has many functions, including excretory, endo-
crine, and metabolic functions. GFR is one component of

excretory function but is widely accepted as the best overall
index of kidney function because it is generally reduced after
widespread structural damage and most other kidney func-
tions decline in parallel with GFR in CKD.

In this section, we describe the overall approach for the
evaluation of GFR. As in the previous KDIGO Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of
Chronic Kidney Disease,1 the ﬁrst method to evaluate GFR
should be eGFRcr. If necessary for greater accuracy, the
approach then recommends subsequent
supportive tests
from either the more accurate eGFRcr-cys or measurement
of GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous
ﬁltration markers. In contrast to the previous guideline, we
emphasize the use of eGFRcr-cys based on accumulating
evidence for its greater accuracy across populations and the
use of mGFR given the known residual errors

techniques and standards that satisfy the requirements for
robust result reporting. We encourage healthcare providers
to have a clear understanding of the value and limitations
of both ﬁltration markers and mGFR, the importance of
standardization of assays for creatinine and cystatin C, and
quality control procedures for exogenous markers. Finally,

1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR

Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR” when referring
to the speciﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use
the more general term “kidney function(s)” when dealing
with the totality of functions of the kidney.

The kidneys play several roles in the body,

including
metabolism and excretion of substances, volume and BP
regulation, erythropoietin production, and regulation of
electrolytes, acid-base status, and mineral homeostasis.
Glomerular ﬁltration is one of many functions of the kidney.
GFR is considered the best overall assessment of kidney
functions as,
these other functions
correlate with the loss of GFR. The term “kidney function”
reﬂects the entirety of different and complex physiological
functions of the kidney; thus, kidney function should not be a
term used interchangeably with GFR.

in general,

losses of

Assessment of the overall functions of the kidney is a
complex task. GFR is used as the primary tool to assess kidney
function in practice. Loss of other kidney functions are
known as complications of CKD and are addressed in
Chapter 3. This section focuses on how GFR can be evaluated
using both mGFR and eGFR.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. There are numerous kidney dis-
orders in children that may present with tubular dysfunction
(e.g., Bartter’s and Dent disease) rather than decreased GFR

or albuminuria. These primarily result in polyuria and/or
electrolyte disturbances and may or may not progress to
reduced GFR or kidney failure. Thus, the exclusive use of GFR
in diagnosing CKD would not be of value in children, high-
lighting the importance of appreciating different markers
linked to different kidney functions.

1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers

We describe a framework for evaluation of GFR beginning
with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests
(Figure 11, Tables 7 and 8127–142).

Figure 11 depicts an algorithm for evaluation of GFR from
initial test using eGFRcr, followed by decisions for when to
perform supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR
(Tables 7 and 8). Healthcare providers should consider both
potential sources of error in eGFR as well as whether the
clinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR when
considering the need for additional
tests. The level of
accuracy that is needed for a clinical decision for the use of
potentially toxic medications, a medication with a narrow
therapeutic window, or for other therapies with potential
for adverse events, may exceed the capability of any eGFR
equation, and in such cases, mGFR should be performed.
This assessment would ideally be performed every time a
GFR value is used to make a clinical decision.

Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and
an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR
(Figure 11).

There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of
less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of
assessment of GFR. For most clinical circumstances, esti-
mating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging,
and monitoring the progression of CKD, and observational
data documented an increase in CKD recognition and referral
to nephrologists shortly after the implementation of reporting
of eGFR by clinical laboratories, especially for females and
elderly people.143–145 GFR is used in many routine and
complex clinical decisions as an assessment of excretory
kidney function (Table 4) to detect and stage AKD and CKD,
determine CKD progression, dose medications, determine
appropriate use of diagnostic tests, and guide treatment
decisions around KRT therapies. Equations are available

estimation from SCr concentration include non–steady-state
conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement
error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinine
assays. GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levels
than at lower levels, and healthcare providers should remain
aware of caveats for any estimating equation that may
inﬂuence the accuracy in an individual person.

Figure 11 | Approach to glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests. The algorithm describes the
approach to the evaluation of GFR. The approach uses initial and supportive testing to develop a ﬁnal assessment of true GFR and to apply it in
individual decision-making. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr), which will be available for most
people because creatinine is measured routinely as part of the basic metabolic panel. If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a more
accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then,
if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated. If eGFRcr-cys
is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR should
be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous ﬁltration markers. *Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or
eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants such as changes in muscle
mass or creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of speciﬁc medications. †Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low
muscle mass or very high levels of inﬂammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use. ‡Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in
otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion or
extrarenal elimination due to the use of speciﬁc medications.

Most people with CKD and their healthcare providers would
prefer the more accurate assessment of kidney function resulting
from the use of GFR estimating equations compared with SCr
alone. Minimal cost or resources issues are expected because
creatinine is available in healthcare settings globally, and evalu-
ating GFR with the use of creatinine in the form of GFR esti-
mating equations has been recommended for >20 years.

eGFR from creatinine is widely used. Attention is required
to implement and ensure the quality of eGFR reporting by
clinical laboratories and ensure coordination with the elec-
tronic medical record (EMR), including those eGFR reports
from point-of-care settings (Section 1.2.2).

Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using
eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is less
accurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making
(Table 8127-142) (1C).

This recommendation places a high value on using estimates of
GFR derived from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C in
clinical situations where eGFRcr is an unreliable or inadequate
assessment of GFR. There is consistent evidence that eGFRcr-cys
provides more accurate estimates of mGFR than eGFRcr and
eGFRcys in ambulatory people.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. Please see Practice Point
1.2.2.1 regarding the beneﬁt of accurate assessment of GFR for
clinical decision-making. In clinical practice, there may be
situations where the estimation of GFR from SCr alone may
be a source of error, for example, muscle wasting/loss, or
where greater accuracy of GFR estimation is required for
clinical decision-making (e.g., drug dosing). In most of these
situations, estimating GFR using a combined creatinine and
cystatin C equation provides the required degree of accuracy
and obviates the need for expensive and time-consuming
measurement of GFR using an approved gold standard
methodology. GFR estimating equations that incorporate both
creatinine and cystatin C have particular beneﬁt in terms of
improved accuracy in relation to mGFR compared with
equivalent equations using only one of these markers.91,92,146–149
In 2 large-scale studies in pooled cohorts of general pop-
ulation cohorts and clinical populations in North America
and Europe, the P30 (deﬁned as the percentage of the eGFR
values within (cid:6)30% of mGFR) using eGFRcr-cys is in the
range of 90%,91,147 which is considered optimal.1 Greater
accuracy of eGFRcr-cys compared with eGFRcr or eGFRcys
is also observed in studies evaluating GFR estimating
equations compared with mGFR in other countries such as
Brazil, Congo, Pakistan, Singapore, Japan, and China, with
P30 estimated between 80% and 90%,77,78,83,88,93,136,150–154
which is considered adequate for most decision-making.1

Potential harms include increased costs, as described
below, and greater complexity in the interpretation of GFR
with discrepant
results between eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and
eGFRcr-cys. This in turn may lead to an increased number of
nephrology consults, especially initially as healthcare pro-
viders may be unfamiliar with these new tests.

Certainty of evidence. The Work Group considered the
overall certainty of the evidence to be moderate to high in
ambulatory people who were neither frail nor had acute or

chronic illnesses, and low in other populations due to in-
consistencies and imprecision in the studies currently avail-
able in the literature. Most of
the studies used in the
development and initial external validation of these equations
were performed in ambulatory people who were neither frail
nor had acute or chronic illnesses. There remains a paucity of
studies examining the accuracy of eGFR in such pop-
ulations.142 Many studies that have been performed in such

variability, and show inconsistent results among the studies
even within the same disease. Some reports in populations
with cancer, HIV, or obesity demonstrate greater accuracy
for eGFRcr-cys than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys.132–135,155–157
Consistent with these ﬁndings, a large study of people living
in Stockholm, Sweden referred for an mGFR test who had
diagnoses for heart failure,
liver failure, cancer, CVD, or
diabetes found eGFRcr-cys to be the most accurate and
least biased.82 In other studies of sick or frail people, such
as very advanced liver or heart failure or those admitted to
the intensive care unit, all eGFR tests demonstrated very
low levels of accuracy.73,137,158–161

risk

for

There are insufﬁcient data to indicate the accuracy of
eGFRcr, eGFRcys, or eGFRcr-cys for many diseases. For
example, in people with high cell turnover such as hematologic
cancers, we expect that cystatin C would provide highly inac-
curate estimates due to the increase in cystatin C because of cell
turnover rather than decreased GFR disease.162–165 However,
there are no data to evaluate that hypothesis. Importantly, even
for people from populations where eGFRcr-cys has been
demonstrated to be more accurate, healthcare providers should
assess the potential sources of error in eGFR and the need for a
highly accurate level of GFR. Among people who are frail or
with multiple comorbid illnesses, eGFRcr-cys may be insufﬁ-
ciently accurate due to large contributions from non-GFR
determinants of creatinine, cystatin C, or both markers.

creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased
creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of
speciﬁc medications, it is possible that eGFRcys rather than
eGFRcr-cys would be preferred.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that most
people and most healthcare providers would want to use the
most accurate assessment of GFR available to them and
would, therefore, wish to estimate GFR from a combination
of creatinine and cystatin C, when available. However, they
would also balance additional costs associated with cystatin C
against the potential beneﬁts.

Differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys may prompt
recognition that both are estimates of GFR and both are asso-
ciated with error, requiring interpretation as to the best esti-
mate of GFR. In our view, this is desirable, and uncertainty as to
the level of GFR is an indication for nephrology referral.

Resource use and costs. Costs for the higher frequency of
cystatin C testing include one-time costs associated with initi-
ation of the assay within a laboratory, which include building
the information technology infrastructure and method veriﬁ-
cation studies, and continuous costs associated with main-
taining the assay, which include reagents, daily quality control,
requirements for calibration veriﬁcation, and proﬁciency
testing. Reagent costs are currently more expensive than
creatinine but are lower compared with other commonly used
biomarkers. If cystatin C is performed in an outside laboratory,
other costs, as with any laboratory test, may ensue. Additional
costs may also be a result of the increased referrals to ne-
phrologists to assist the interpretation of potentially discordant
results between eGFRcr and eGFRcys. Ideally, these decrease
over time with increased utilization.

Considerations for implementation. We recognize that for
these recommendations to be implemented, cystatin C needs
to be widely available. Wherever possible, access to both
creatinine and cystatin C measurements should be made
available when evaluating GFR. Education for healthcare
providers and people with CKD for optimal use and inter-
pretation of these tests is required. See Section 1.2.3 for details
regarding the measurement of creatinine and cystatin C by
clinical laboratories.

Rationale
We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginning
with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests
(Figure 11, Table 7). Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous
ﬁltration marker that is now increasingly available. Its assay
can be put on autoanalyzers, and therefore its utilization could
be increased with clinical demand. eGFRcr-cys provides the
most accurate estimate and is recommended as the primary
supportive test for people in whom there are concerns about
eGFRcr accuracy (Table 8127–142). However,
there remain
residual errors with some groups of people having a very high
level of errors. In such people, we advocate using mGFR. We
anticipate that such considerations be made at every encounter
where GFR is being used for a clinical decision.

Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment
of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using
plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous ﬁltration
marker (Table 9).

Given the beneﬁt of accurate assessment of GFR for clin-
ical decision-making, there is a need to appreciate the value
and circumstances in which directly mGFR is required. The
greatest beneﬁt of mGFR is that it is less inﬂuenced by non-
GFR determinants, in contrast to eGFR. GFR is measured
using exogenous ﬁltration markers and urinary or plasma
clearance. The precision of mGFR can be determined from
variability with repeated measures. Time-to-time variability is
the method used to assess error.

Table 10 | Indications for measured GFR

Clinical conditions in which eGFRcr-cys is inaccurate or uncertain due to potential non-GFR determinants of creatinine and cystatin C. This may include
catabolic states, such as serious infections or inﬂammatory states, high cell turnover as in some cancers, advanced cirrhosis or heart failure, use of high-
dose steroids, or the very frail. See Figure 12 for approach to individual decision-making.

Clinical settings in which greater accuracy is needed than is achieved with eGFRcr-cys. For example, decisions about simultaneous kidney transplant at
the time of other solid organ transplant, kidney donor candidacy, and drug dosing if there is a narrow therapeutic index or serious toxicity (e.g.,
chemotherapies that are cleared by the kidney).

better-preserved GFRs, earlier blood sampling is most accurate,
and in people with extensive edema or ascites, plasma clearance
protocols are very inaccurate and not recommended; instead,
urinary clearance protocols are recommended.167 Finally, it is
well recognized that assessing GFR using the imaging of
nuclear tracers is less accurate than eGFR, and we do not
recommend it as a method to measure GFR.168

The evaluation of

time-to-time variability of plasma
clearance of iohexol and eGFR found a within-subject bio-
logical coefﬁcient of variation (CV) for mGFR of 6.7% (95%
CI: 5.6%–8.2%), whereas CVs for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and
eGFRcr-cys were approximately 5.0%.169 Other studies have
observed CV for this same mGFR method ranging from
approximately 5% to 10%.169,170 There are less data for
other methods;
iothalamate,
estimated CVs were 6.3% and 16.6% across 2 studies.171–173
The Work Group judged that there will be some clinical
situations where estimating GFR from both creatinine and
cystatin C will be insufﬁciently reliable or precise, and the
greatest beneﬁt and least harm will be achieved by measuring
GFR with the appropriate standardized methods.

for urinary clearance of

Costs for mGFR are variable and harder to quantify. The
infrastructure required is greater, as testing requires both
patient and personnel time for inserting a peripheral intra-
venous catheter, administering the exogenous marker, col-
lecting serial blood specimens over several hours (depending
on the protocol), and the associated materials for the
collection and measuring blood levels by high-performance
liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Utilization of
mGFR may require input from a nephrologist in some set-
tings, which would also add to the costs of testing.

All nephrologists ideally should therefore have access to at
least 1 method to measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance
of exogenous markers. To ensure highly accurate measurements,
these clearance methods should be performed using standard
operating procedures. External quality assessment (EQA) should
be used for assays of the exogenous markers. Special consider-
ations in clearance methods are required for some populations to
obtain a high level of accuracy (e.g., later sampling time for
people with low GFR or urinary, instead of plasma clearance for
edematous people). GFR centers, under the direction of a
nephrologist champion or laboratory director, analogous to
cardiac imaging, are likely to help both increase utilization and
ensure high quality results. There will be additional requirements
for storage, administration, and disposal if radionuclide meth-
odologies are adopted. National kidney societies can work with
payers to support reimbursement for mGFR procedures. The

European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) together with
the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine is currently harmonizing mGFR protocols for iohexol
plasma clearance to deliver standardized operating procedures
for GFR measurements in the near future.

Decisions to measure GFR should be made by both ne-
phrologists and other physicians using the framework sug-
gested in Figure 11. Physicians should determine how accurate
the GFR needs to be for a speciﬁc clinical decision. If greater
accuracy is needed than can be achieved using eGFR, mGFR
is recommended. Greater accuracy may be required due to
inaccuracy of eGFR in the individual person due to the
presence of non-GFR determinants or due to the requirement
of the clinical setting. Table 10 lists indications for when one
might consider mGFR as opposed to eGFRcr-cys.

We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginning
with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests
(Figure 11, Table 7). mGFR is recommended when there are
concerns about the accuracy of eGFRcr-cys (Table 8127-142) or
where an accurate level of GFR is required for optimal
decision-making, as described in Table 10.

Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitations
in both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate
(mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that inﬂuence
SCr and cystatin C measurements.

All studies evaluating the performance of eGFR compared
with mGFR observe error in any GFR estimate. Even in
populations where there is a high accuracy (i.e., P30 of 90%),
10% of the population would have errors $30% relative to
mGFR. Within these studies, error rates are likely to be higher
in some subgroups and lower in others. A critical component
of the recommended approach to evaluation of GFR (Figure
11) is that physicians have a clear understanding of the
value and limitations of eGFR and mGFR, which deﬁnes
when a person requires one or another supportive test.

The source of error in eGFR may be related to errors in eGFR
or in mGFR (Figure 12174). The most important sources of error
are non-GFR determinants of either creatinine or cystatin C. The
non-GFR determinants of creatinine include generation by diet
and muscle mass,
extrarenal
elimination.130,175 The non-GFR determinants of cystatin C
are less well understood but thought to be higher adiposity,
smoking, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess,
and chronic inﬂammation (as indicated by insulin resistance,
higher levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor,
or lower levels of serum albumin).129,130,176–185

Figure 12 | Sources and magnitude of error around measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR). It is
important to determine how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for clinical decision-making. P30 for eGFR refers to the percent of
eGFRs that are within 30% of mGFR. If accuracy within 30% is acceptable (P30 >80%) or optimal (P30 >90%), eGFR may be sufﬁcient, provided
that there are not large deviations in non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C. If greater accuracy is needed, mGFR is advised. The
accuracy for mGFR is based on time-to-time variability. P15 for mGFR refers to the percent of one mGFR that was within 15% of the second. At a
GFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 42 to 78 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to
51 to 69 ml/min per 1.73 m2. At a GFR of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 21 to 39 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 15%
accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 26 to 35 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Non-GFR determinants of endogenous ﬁltration markers include generation,
tubular handling, and extrarenal elimination. Nonideal properties of exogenous ﬁltration markers include tabular handling and extrarenal
elimination. Reproduced from Kidney International, volume 96, issue 2, Inker LA, Levey AS. Knowing your GFR—when is the number not (exactly)

mGFR also differs from the true physiological GFR, which
itself cannot be directly measured. Errors may be related to
analytical errors in the assay or the clearance procedure. For
example, the overestimation of GFR is seen if late samples are
not taken for people with low GFR.167,186 Urinary clearances
are preferred to plasma clearance methods in people with
extensive third spacing of ﬂuid.169–173 In the absence of
changes related to disease progression, a change in mGFR
from time to time may occur due to preanalytical (e.g.,
patient preparation and time of day), analytical (laboratory
measurement variability), and biological (changes in true
physiological GFR) variability, as is the case for eGFR. This
does not detract from the advantage of mGFR as being free
from non-GFR determinants.

poses are performed in the morning after a period of fasting or

demonstrates increase in SCr of approximately 20 mmol/l
(0.23 mg/dl) which in the study population was equivalent to
decrease in eGFR of approximately 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
Maximum postprandial effects were reached in some subjects
by 2 hours and others by 4 hours. Waiting for at least 12
hours before the measurement of SCr, after meat or ﬁsh
intake, best avoids this effect. We recognize that this approach
may be challenging to implement in the clinical environment.

Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in
eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time.

When evaluating a change in eGFR over time, the question
is whether the true GFR is changing. However as described
above, there are several other potential causes for a change in
observed eGFR, other than AKI, such as changes in non-GFR
determinants of the ﬁltration markers or analytical errors in
the assays. Healthcare providers should consider whether
there has been a change in non-GFR determinants (e.g., a
recent meat meal now or at the ﬁrst measurement or change
in muscle mass or extreme activity). The impact of the
combined effect of analytical and biological variation on
eGFR in determining progression is discussed in Chapter 2.

c h a p t e r 1

When evaluating a change in GFR using mGFR, the com-
bined effect of changes in biological and analytical variation
should be considered as part of the interpretation of the re-
sults (Figure 12174).169

Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C–based
estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some
speciﬁc circumstances.

The combination of eGFRcr and eGFRcys together is more
accurate than eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone.91,147 The greater
accuracy is due to the fact that the non-GFR determinants
for each marker are different, and therefore using both
leads to convergence on the estimate of GFR and minimizes
the effect of either marker.188

In individuals where non-GFR determinants of creatinine
or cystatin C are substantially greater than for the other
marker, eGFRcr-cys would not provide the more accurate
estimate. This imbalance is more likely to occur for creati-
nine, given its association with diet and muscle mass, which
can vary greatly across various people. In such cases, it would
be reasonable to use eGFRcys.

The non-GFR determinants for cystatin C are less well
studied, and it is erroneous to assume that eGFRcys provides
the more accurate estimate in all circumstances. We, there-
fore, advise limiting this strategy to selected clinical settings
where people are otherwise healthy with known changes in
non-GFR determinants of creatinine. For example, in 1 study
that compared eGFRcr and eGFRcys before and after ampu-
tation in otherwise healthy military veterans, there was a
sizable change in eGFRcr as would be expected with the loss
of a limb and loss of mobility, but no change in eGFRcys.128
In another study of people with anorexia, serum levels of
cystatin C were more strongly correlated with mGFR than
were levels of SCr, but this has not been further evaluated
using eGFR and standardized assays.127 Other situations
may be where there are medications that inhibit tubular
secretion of creatinine, although there are no studies to
provide evidence to drive guidance.

Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of dif-
ferences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may be
informative,
in both direction and magnitude of those
differences.

For people who have simultaneous SCr and cystatin C
values, the agreement or discrepancy between eGFRcr and
eGFRcys may help to guide further actions. Several studies
have demonstrated that 25%–30% of people have discordance
between eGFRcr and eGFRcys as large as or larger than 15 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 or $20%.82,138,189 One study demonstrated
for eGFRcr
that
factors associated with higher values
female sex,
compared with eGFRcys included older age,
non–Black race, higher eGFR, higher BMI, weight loss, and
current smoking.190 Two recent studies demonstrate that
when there is concordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys,
there is high and similar accuracy for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and
eGFRcr-cys with estimated P30 of 87%–91%.82,138,189 In

contrast, when there is discordance, eGFRcr-cys is more
accurate than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys. This suggests that
when eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant, it is reasonable
to continue to measure cystatin C serially in addition to
creatinine in those settings where GFR will affect clinical
decisions.
is also reasonable to consider performing/
conducting mGFR when using medications with narrow
therapeutic index or high toxicity or to inform critical
treatment decisions (Chapter 4).

is widely available and therefore
commonly used but is highly prone to error due to under- or
overcollection. A systematic review of GFR methods observed
a mean bias of 25% across 23 studies, and as such, did not
ﬁnd this method to reach sufﬁcient accuracy.166 The errors
occur in both directions and thus do not appear solely due
to the presence of tubular secretion of creatinine, which
would be expected to overestimate mGFR. For example, in
the pilot study for the African American Study of Kidney
Disease
(AASK), 25% of participants had a 24-hour
measured CrCl that was at least 18% lower than the mGFR,
and another 25% had measured CrCl at least 23% greater
than the GFR. Of note, measured CrCl had substantially
better correlation with mGFR when it was measured during
an mGFR procedure191; therefore, if measured CrCl is to be
performed, then it should ideally be supervised given the
high risk of inaccuracy with urine collection.

Special considerations

Sex and gender considerations. It is unclear how best to
estimate GFR in people who are transgender, gender-diverse,
or nonbinary, where a person’s gender identity is different
from their sex assigned at birth. Gender-afﬁrming testos-
terone therapy is associated with an increase in SCr concen-
tration,192 with less certainty for the impact of estrogen.
Gender-afﬁrming testosterone therapy is associated with an
increase in serum cystatin C and gender-afﬁrming estradiol,
and antiandrogen therapy is associated with a decrease in
impact of gender-afﬁrming
serum cystatin C.193 The
hormone therapy,
if any, on true GFR is unknown. In
keeping with guidance from the American Association of
Clinical Chemistry and the National Kidney Foundation,194
evaluation of eGFR should use a shared decision-making
approach with the person with CKD, taking into account
muscle mass, sex hormone milieu, sex assigned at birth,
the new EKFC
and gender identity. We also note that
cystatin equation does not include a variable for sex.

externally validated data to assess if combining creatinine and
cystatin improves the performance of pediatric eGFR equa-
tions. Internal analysis of the Chronic Kidney Disease in

interferences.
Although enzymatic methods are not totally immune to the
interferences affecting the Jaffe method and may be suscep-
tible to other interferences speciﬁc to the enzymatic approach,
in the majority of people, use of an enzymatic method will
reduce the possibility of interference (Table 12127,196–215). It is
likely that cystatin C measurements will be less susceptible to
chemical and spectral interferences affecting creatinine assays,
but inevitably, interferences will surface with more extensive
clinical experience, for example, those due to circulating
antibodies that are seen with other immunoassays.216–218

in unseparated samples, there is a
gradual increase in measured SCr over time when the Jaffe

Consistency, standardization, and comparability of labo-
ratory measures of creatinine and cystatin C; the reporting of
results and of GFR estimates; and the ﬂagging of reported
results where indicated are of paramount importance. The
assays used should have the required speciﬁcity for the ana-
lyte, and the calibration of assays is essential for the inter-
pretation of kidney function measures. Results should be
traceable to reference materials and methods listed on the
Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine
(JCTLM) database.

identiﬁcation of CKD.
Adoption of the laboratory standards described here will
ensure that healthcare providers receive eGFR reports in a
consistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracy
and reliability of the result. Flagging decreased values for
eGFR can alert healthcare providers to the possibility of
kidney disease and may indicate the need for additional
evaluation or adjustment of doses of medications that are
excreted by the kidney.

Globally, most creatinine measurements are undertaken
using a colorimetric method (Jaffe). This method also reacts
with a variety of substances that are not creatinine (so-called
“non-creatinine chromogens,” e.g., glucose and acetoacetate),

variability that is less than half the within-person biological
variability is generally considered desirable.222 The target
CVs proposed here for creatinine and cystatin C should be
achievable by automated laboratory methods. Achieving the
target precision and bias goals proposed will ensure that
laboratory error contributes to a less than 10% increase in
root mean square error when estimating GFR.205

Most people with CKD, healthcare providers, and policy
makers would want laboratories to implement calibrated as-
says for creatinine and cystatin C that comply with interna-
tional standards and use reagents for analysis that conform to
internationally approved reference materials. Compliance
with the recommended standards would ensure conﬁdence in
the results and in clinical decisions and any changes in
management and treatment made as a consequence.

Globally, most GFR estimates are currently produced using
creatinine results generated by Jaffe assays, which are rela-
tively inexpensive. Use of more speciﬁc enzymatic creatinine
assays can improve the estimation of GFR. However, enzy-
matic creatinine assays are more expensive than Jaffe assays.
Use of cystatin C in combined creatinine-cystatin C GFR
equations can also further improve GFR estimation, but
signiﬁcantly to the cost.
cystatin C measurement adds
Although the per-patient cost increase of enzymatic creatinine
and cystatin C measurement is relatively small, the imple-
mentation of these more expensive approaches has signiﬁcant
cost implications across entire healthcare systems.

Implementation considerations include the following:
Creatinine. Resource limitations that may restrict access to
enzymatic creatinine should not be seen as a barrier to
implementation of a GFR reporting program based on Jaffe
creatinine measurement.

Cystatin C. Ideally, cystatin C will be available for timely
same-day results, which requires either measurement within

laboratory or alternatively as a referred test in
the local
centralized laboratories. A range of commercially available
routine clinical biochemistry analyzers from a variety of
manufacturers can support cystatin C assays and will allow
turnaround time for results as rapid as that for routine
electrolytes and creatinine when provided locally. Timeliness
will affect utilization (i.e., if results are available on the same
day), then the test is more likely to be useful for routine or
urgent decisions, and this may increase the pressure on lab-
oratories to provide this test locally.

Estimated GFR. Implementation and modiﬁcation (e.g., a
change in equation) of GFR estimation require close
communication between the laboratory and a range of clinical
users, including primary and secondary care healthcare pro-
viders, pharmacists, dietitians, and people with CKD.223
Laboratories should only use GFR estimating equations that
have been sufﬁciently validated in the population to which
they are being applied and that are appropriate for the
creatinine and cystatin C assays in use (Section 1.2.4).223
They should also ensure that their end-to-end reporting
processes,
embedded within the
laboratory information system, are subject to regular EQA.
Laboratory reports for computed values should indicate the
ﬁltration marker (i.e., eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and eGFRcr-cys).
Documentation should indicate which equation was used.

including calculations

To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare
systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number of
meaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach in
relation to reporting units of GFR, creatinine, and cystatin C
should be implemented. Input age may be rounded to whole
numbers or as a fractional year because the inﬂuence on
eGFR is small. To adjust GFR for differences in body size,
mGFR is commonly adjusted for body surface area (BSA),
with a population average BSA value of 1.73 m2 being used. In
practice, eGFR values derived using most equations are
already adjusted for BSA, because BSA was taken into account
when the equations were originally developed using regres-
sion modeling against BSA-adjusted mGFR.

eGFR is mostly computed using the information recorded
in the sex variable in EMRs. Some EMRs include legal sex, sex
assigned at birth, and gender identity, whereas others include
only one variable. In some cases, this variable may be missing
or reported as nonbinary. In these cases, eGFR values cannot
be computed and will be displayed as a missing value. Lab-
oratories should add a comment directing healthcare pro-
viders and people with CKD to online calculators to facilitate
a shared decision-making approach to the person with CKD.
The comment may also include a suggestion to use cystatin C
as there is less difference between eGFRcys values for males
and females and where there is now an option for computing
eGFR without the use of sex.

Together, the set of statements allow for a consistent
approach to the measurement and reporting of serum ﬁltra-
tion markers and eGFR in clinical practice.

1.2.4 Selection of GFR estimating equations

Practice Point 1.2.3.3: Laboratories measuring creatinine in
infants or small children must ensure their quality control
process include the lowest end of the expected range of
values for the group of interest.

Recommendation 1.2.4.1: We recommend using a
validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR
from serum ﬁltration markers (eGFR) rather than
relying on the serum ﬁltration markers alone (1D).

Practice Point 1.2.3.4: Consider the consistent use of
enzymatic creatinine assays in children, given the higher
relative contribution of non-creatinine chromogens to
measured creatinine in children when using the Jaffe assay,
and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samples
in the neonatal period.

Practice Point 1.2.3.5: An eGFRcr level <90 ml/min per
1.73 m2 can be ﬂagged as “low” in children and adolescents
over the age of 2 years.

Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease,1 a
cutoff of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was chosen to deﬁne “low”
GFR for children. In this update, we advise increasing the
cutoff to 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for children and adolescents.
In children and adolescents, a reduced GFR is likely to
deteriorate further and, therefore, warrants closer monitoring
and early intervention. Children with lower-than-normal GFR
often experience deterioration in GFR during periods of rapid
growth in adolescence.224 Those with subnormal GFR during
adolescence are more likely to eventually experience clinically
important low GFR later in life. Even mild decreases in
eGFR (i.e., CKD G2) are associated with poor kidney
outcomes. In a US study of over 7 million children captured
by electronic health record data, 8600 had CKD G2. At 10
years from cohort entry, the rate of reaching kidney failure
or a 50% decline in eGFR ranged from around 10%
(nonglomerular CKD) to around 40% (glomerular CKD).225
Furthermore, eGFR between 60 and 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2
is sometimes associated with impaired linear growth and
with hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents.226,227

A higher cutoff deﬁning low GFR for children and ado-
lescents also reﬂects their longer life expectancy. Early inter-
vention may have profound protection of GFR. CKD G2 has
long been considered to reﬂect decreased GFR in children,
reﬂected by the inclusion of children and adolescents with
CKD G2 in pediatric CKD trials and cohort studies, including
Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on
the Progression of CRF in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE),228
Hypertension Optimal Treatment in Children with Chronic
Kidney Disease (HOT-KIDS; United Kingdom),229 CKiD
(North America),230 KoreaN cohort study for outcomes in
people with pediatric CKD (KNOW-PedCKD;
South
Korea),231 and the Kids with CKD (KCAD; Australia and
New Zealand).232 The
of CKD remains
unchanged; the ﬂagging of GFR <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 as
low for children and adolescents reﬂects the need for closer
assessment for evidence of kidney damage and monitoring.

deﬁnition

Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within
geographical regions (as deﬁned locally [e.g., continent,
country, and region] and as large as possible). Within such
regions, equations may differ for adults and children.

The recommendation places a high value on the use of an
estimating equation for GFR that has been validated in the
population of interest and which has been shown to be most
accurate in comparison with mGFR and a low value on the
comparison of performance
characteristics across different
equations. The key points are to use an equation validated in
and most suited to the population of interest.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. This recommendation rec-
ognizes that there are now a number of validated GFR esti-
mating equations available. They have differing performance
characteristics, which may differ depending on the population
of interest. The intention of suggesting the use of the same
equation within a region is to reduce clinical confusion if
people with CKD go to different laboratories within a region
and to enable appropriate population comparisons. Use of
different equations (and thus different eGFR values for the
same person) may lead to confusion for both the individual
person and their healthcare providers.

The Work Group judged that there is potential for harm if
people get different eGFR values when receiving care in
different settings. As described in Section 1.2.2, there are
several sources of variability in eGFR. Differences between
valid equations are often substantially less than these sources
of variability, but that might not be understood by most
healthcare providers or people, leading to excessive anxiety
and repeated testing for small changes in GFR as related to
the use of a different GFR estimating equation. Using the
same equation within the same geographical region can
eliminate the source of variation that is related to the speciﬁc
parameters of the GFR estimating equation.

There is beneﬁt to clinical care, research, and public health
with the use of validated equations such that decisions,
research ﬁndings, and public policy are informed by accurate
estimates of CKD.

Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on
Work Group consensus regarding good clinical practice to use
a GFR estimating equation validated in the population of
interest. Table 13 lists criteria for validated equations.

The criteria were developed by accumulated evidence from
assessment of the performance of eGFR versus mGFR across
equations and populations. For example, use of equations
developed using assays that are not traceable to reference

different characteristics.153,234,235

Values and preferences. There are now several valid equa-
tions that can be reasonably used in local settings. The Work
Group recognizes that different values and preferences may
lead to different decisions in selection among validated GFR
estimating equations. Thus, instead of being prescriptive, we
list a set of criteria that deﬁnes a valid equation, a set of
equations considered valid at this time, and a list of metrics to
deﬁne better versus worse performance as evaluated in the
local area. It is of value that GFR thresholds for deﬁnition and
staging be standardized using valid equations optimized for a
speciﬁc region helps to ensure this occurs. Where possible,
inclusion of representation from key constituents in the
population in the development of the equation and ensuring
that it remains valid in those populations is also of value.

Using validated eGFR equations improves the accuracy of
assessment of true GFR but remains imperfect, and no single
equation performs consistently across all populations. The Work
Group judged that people with CKD and their healthcare pro-
viders would want GFR estimated using the equation providing
the greatest accuracy in the population of their geographical
region. The Work Group recognizes that across the world there is
signiﬁcant variation in the sociodemographic and ethnic
makeup of populations and that even well-validated equations
developed in different populations may not perform as well as
others developed and validated in the population of interest.

Resource use and costs. There are a number of initial costs
including human resource costs associated with taking the time
to decide on which equation, then time and technical infor-
mation resources to be considered to change the computation,
and the laboratory and nephrology teams to test the new
equation and inform the clinical partners on the change. In
addition, education for primary care providers, people with

CKD, and other healthcare providers is also required, which
incurs both direct and indirect costs. There will be costs, both
human resource and meetings costs, associated with decision-
making around which equation to use. Additional costs will be
accrued if validation and impact studies are required.

Considerations for implementation. Each region should have
a mechanism for review and selection of equations for
implementation by laboratories. For most countries, this
might be through the national kidney society working in
collaboration with laboratory physician organizations or
regional laboratory groups, as has occurred in the United
States and Europe, respectively.236,237 Decisions at this level by
continental or national organizations are likely to minimize
the likelihood that decisions for equation use will be made
within small geographical areas or governed by local
decisions,

uncertainty by people with CKD and healthcare providers.

in decisions about

leading to greater

There are likely to be tradeoffs between optimal accuracy
in local regions versus uniformity. Equations optimized for a
speciﬁc region can help to ensure that the GFR thresholds for
disease deﬁnition, classiﬁcation, and risk estimation have the
same implications across regions. However, it would lead to
barriers to implementation, as it will not be possible for all
regions to conduct a sufﬁciently large and representative
study to evaluate these equations and develop modiﬁcations.
If not possible, or in the interim, we advise using equations
that were developed in populations most similar to the
available populations. For example, until more accurate re-
gion-speciﬁc equations are available in countries within
Central or South America, it may be reasonable to use CKD-
EPI given the inclusion of Black and Hispanic participants in
the development of equation, and within African countries, to
use the EKFC equations using the Q-values, the median SCr
concentration in a cohort developed in 2 African countries.234

However, other considerations may also be relevant for the
regional organization making these decisions. We also note
that if cystatin C is available, then using eGFRcr-cys would
simplify the selection of the equation as the performance of
eGFRcr-cys computed from the different equations is more
similar than that of eGFRcr.

Rationale
The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evalu-
ation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease recom-
mended “to report eGFRcr in adults using the 2009 CKD-EPI
creatinine equation. An alternative creatinine-based GFR
estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown to
improve accuracy of GFR estimates compared to the 2009
CKD-EPI creatinine equation.” We are updating this recom-
mendation to accommodate the availability of alternative
equations that also have high levels of accuracy. Since the
publication of the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline
for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-
ease1 for GFR estimation in adults, there have been 3 main
sources of validated equations:
those developed by the
CKD-EPI, those developed by EKFC, and modiﬁcations of
each for use in speciﬁc regions (Table 1483,91,147,148,235,238–
243). Table 15 lists thresholds for key performance metrics
that can be used to guide comparison between equations.

The CKD-EPI Research Group developed equations for
estimating GFR from creatinine, cystatin C, and the combination
of both, with and without inclusion of a coefﬁcient for Black
race. The concerns about the continued use of race in GFR that
led to the removal of the race coefﬁcient are described in the
rationale that follows Practice Point 1.2.4.2. The 2009 CKD-EPI
creatinine equation includes creatinine, age, race, and sex.238 The
2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation was reﬁtted without race and
includes creatinine, age, and sex.147 As a consequence of not
including the Black race coefﬁcient,
the 2021 CKD-EPI
creatinine equation leads to a small overestimate of GFR in
non-Black individuals and a small underestimate in Black
individuals. The 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more
accurate than the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation in the
non-Black race group, as indicated by the percentage of eGFRs
within 30% of mGFR (P30), although the change in the level of
accuracy is small compared with the known variability in
mGFR and eGFR, and P30 remains at the level consistent with
recommended targets as indicated in prior CKD guidelines
(Table 1483,91,147,148,235,238–243 Section 1.2.2, Figure 12174).1,147
The 2021 CKD-EPI eGFR creatinine-cystatin C equation that
includes both ﬁltration markers but does not include a term
for Black race leads to improved accuracy in both race groups,
with less difference between race groups in all metrics. The
EKFC developed equations for estimating GFR from creatinine
and cystatin C.91,240 Before implementation in other regions,
the

population-speciﬁc Q-values for the creatinine-based EKFC

creatinine equation had a Q-value developed from Belgium
and Sweden but was validated in 7 European studies and is
recommended for use in White Europeans.240 They have
recently published Q-values for Black Europeans developed
from a cohort of 90 kidney donors in Paris and for Black
Africans
in République
Démocratique de Congo Cote D’Ivoire. The EKFC cystatin C
equation includes only age and cystatin C, that is, it does not
include sex or race. The Q-value for cystatin C was developed
in a White cohort in Uppsala, Sweden. The cystatin C–based
EKFC equation has been validated in White Europeans, Black
Europeans, White Americans, and Black Africans. To increase
accuracy
averaging
and precision, EKFC recommends
creatinine and cystatin C to obtain an estimate of GFR that
includes both ﬁltration markers. eGFRcr-cys (the average of
the EKFC creatinine and EKFC cystatin C) also provides the
most accurate estimates, consistent with the ﬁndings of CKD-
EPI eGFRcr-cys.

In both the CKD-EPI and EKFC external validation data-
sets, there are consistent ﬁndings that the eGFRcr-cys provides
improved performance in estimating mGFR compared with
the respective creatinine- or cystatin-only equations. This re-
inforces the recommendation in Section 1.2.1 emphasizing the
greater use of eGFRcr-cys for decisions that require GFR.

There have been several modiﬁcations to the CKD-EPI
equations for use in individual countries, including China, Japan,
and Pakistan.83,153,235 We expect country-speciﬁc modiﬁcations
of both CKD-EPI and EKFC to continue to be developed. One
recent study in China reported no clinically meaningful
difference in the performance of the Asian-modiﬁed CKD-EPI
and EKFC equations compared with mGFR.244

Studies vary in their consistency and precision. Direct
comparisons of available estimating equations in populations
with worldwide applicability are lacking, and so too are
validation studies comparing equations against mGFR in all
populations of interest. The overall certainty of the evidence is
therefore low but where the performance characteristics of
GFR estimating equations in the population of interest are
known, there are data to support the use of one equation over
another for improved accuracy of GFR reporting.

Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of
eGFR should be avoided.

Estimating equations for GFR have historically incorpo-
rated demographic variables of age, sex, and race to explain
variation in serum concentrations of endogenous ﬁltration
markers that are unrelated to GFR, thereby minimizing sys-
tematic errors in subgroups deﬁned by these variables and
systematic differences between groups.

Age, sex, and race variables were included in the 2009
CKD-EPI equation as previous studies indicated higher
average SCr for the same mGFR level in people who are older
versus younger, males versus females, and people who are
Black versus non-Black. Incorporation of
these variables
minimized systematic errors in groups and systematic dif-
ferences between groups.147,245 Similarly, subsequent to the

in medicine,

Race differs from age and sex, as race (and ethnicity) is dy-
namic, shaped by geographic, cultural, and sociopolitical forces,
and thus the deﬁnition can change across geography and over
time.246,247 Consistent with this,
in the past several years,
inclusion of race in GFR estimating equations, along with
other algorithms
faced increasing scrutiny,
particularly in the United States but also elsewhere in the
world.248–254 Concerns included, ﬁrst, race is a social and not a
biological construct, and thus the deﬁnition of a race group is
subject to change over time. Second, using a binary variable to
assign race groups ignores social and biological diversity within
and among people with similar racial background groups.
Third, there are differences across countries and regions in
self-reported race and ethnicity, thus leading to uncertainty as
to how to apply the term, and blanket use can lead to error.

Thus, even though the inclusion of an indicator for race
group leads to improved accuracy compared with mGFR in
some studies, these concerns and other considerations led to the
2021 recommendation for it not to be used in the computation
of eGFR in the United States.255 Other countries have also
recognized that race should not be included in computation
and elected to use the CKD-EPI 2009 age, sex, race–non-
Black, as the population of people who are Black was
sufﬁciently small to not warrant error for other groups.236,256
We recognize that speciﬁc countries or regions (e.g., Japan
and Thailand) have developed “region-speciﬁc” equations.153
We advocate for modifying equations based on the population
being tested.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children using
validated equations that have been developed or validated
in comparable populations.

Examples of validated equations include the CKiD under 25
years old (U25) 2021 eGFRcr equation, the EKFC, and the
CKD-EPI40. The Work Group judged that many healthcare
providers would choose the CKiD U25 2021 eGFRcr equation
given it was derived in a multiracial cohort of children with
CKD and has been externally validated in cohorts with reduced
and normal GFR. The performance of the CKiD U25 2021
eGFRcr equation is uncertain in the very young, those with very
low GFR, or in populations outside of Europe and North
America.257 An alternative height/sex/age/creatinine-based
GFR estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown to
improve accuracy of GFR estimates in the population of
interest (Table 1483,91,147,148,235,238–243). The EKFC equation
has been validated in a large cohort of European children (N
¼ 1254), as well as in adults.240 Of interest, the EKFC
equation in children is the same as in adults. Thus, both
CKiD U25 and EKFC allow a GFR estimation for children
the
with CKD without changes in calculated eGFR at
transition between adolescence and young adulthood. In
children with neurological disorders, muscle wasting, or who
have metabolic disorders and are on a very low–protein diet,
a cystatin C–based equation is likely more appropriate.

1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria

Albuminuria refers to abnormal loss of albumin in the urine
(urine ACR $30 mg/g or $3 mg/mmol). Albumin is one type
of plasma protein found in the urine in normal subjects and
in larger quantity in people with kidney disease. In the KDIGO
2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and
Management of Chronic Kidney Disease,1 clinical terminology
was changed to focus on albuminuria rather than proteinuria
as albumin is the principal component of urinary protein in
most kidney diseases. Epidemiologic data demonstrate a strong
relationship between the quantity of urine albumin with both
kidney and CVD risk and observed CVD even at very low
levels, and assays to measure albumin are more precise and
sensitive than assays to measure urine protein. We refer to
albuminuria or urine albumin when discussing general
concepts and will refer either to total protein, albumin, or other
speciﬁc proteins when discussing that parameter speciﬁcally.

1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers

Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for
initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of prefer-
ence). In all cases, a ﬁrst void in the morning midstream
sample is preferred in adults and children.

(i) urine ACR, or
(ii) reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with

automated reading.

If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements:

(i) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR),
(ii) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with auto-

mated reading, or

(iii) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with

manual reading.

Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when
albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods.
(cid:3) Conﬁrm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or pro-
teinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and
express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible
(i.e., quantify the ACR or PCR if initial semiquantitative
tests are positive).

(cid:3) Conﬁrm ACR ‡30 mg/g (‡3 mg/mmol) on a random
untimed urine with a subsequent ﬁrst morning void in
the morning midstream urine sample.

Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affect
interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and
urine creatinine and order conﬁrmatory tests as indicated
(Table 16).

The practice point advocating for the use of spot samples
measuring albumin or protein greatly facilitates its incorpo-
ration into clinical practice by avoiding the need for timed
urine collections. Such spot samples can over- or underesti-
mate urine albumin due to variation in dilution. Use of ACR
or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) in spot urine samples
can decrease this error. ACR is an estimate of total urine al-
bumin loss. The creatinine excretion rate varies substantially
between people. ACR or PCR will overestimate urine albumin
loss in people with low creatinine excretion and will under-
estimate urine albumin or protein loss in people with very
high creatinine excretion.

The decision by prior guideline Work Groups not to have a
sex-speciﬁc threshold and to use easy-to-remember values
regardless of units may also lead to some misclassiﬁcation. On
balance, the current Work Group agrees with this approach
given the continued underutilization of urine albumin in the
assessment of CKD.

It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measure-
ment with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric

(effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to be
missed. The signiﬁcance of this issue is thought to be low in
adults.258–261

In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (<30 mg/24
hours) are lost in the urine. Urine albumin measurement
provides a more speciﬁc and sensitive measure of changes in
glomerular permeability than urinary total protein.262–264
There is evidence that urinary albumin is a more sensitive test
to enable the detection of glomerular pathology associated
with some other systemic diseases including diabetes, hy-
pertension, and systemic sclerosis.265–268

Total protein measurement is problematic in urine due to
imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations—relatively
large increases in urine albumin loss can occur without causing a
signiﬁcant measurable increase in urinary total protein,264 large
sample-to-sample variation in the amount and composition of
proteins, high and variable concentrations of non–protein
interfering substances relative to the protein concentration,

and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency269–271 to react

albuminuria. However, timed samples are often collected with
error. Overnight, ﬁrst void in the morning, second void in the
morning, or random sample collections are therefore rec-
ommended as ﬁrst-line
creatinine
excretion in the urine is fairly constant throughout the 24-
hour period, the measurement of ACR (or PCR) allows
in urinary concentration.283,284
correction for variations
ACR is a suitable alternative to timed measurement of urine
albumin loss.285–290 PCR on random or early morning
untimed samples shows good diagnostic performance and
correlation with 24-hour collection.281,291–298

We acknowledge that reagent strip devices can have a role
in settings where access to laboratory services may be limited
(see Section 1.4).

Implementation of ﬁrst morning voids will be difﬁcult to
obtain in most healthcare settings. Nephrology ofﬁces could
develop protocols to send people with CKD home with a
urine collection container and instruction on how to obtain a
clean catch, which the person brings back before their next
visit. Alternatively, obtaining blood and urine tests before the
next visit can facilitate ﬁrst morning voids. However, in the
absence of a ﬁrst morning void, a random sample may still be
used. Negative ﬁndings in people at high risk for CKD, for
example, where the urine sample is diluted, can be conﬁrmed
with a subsequent ﬁrst morning void. Positive ﬁndings in
people at low risk for CKD, where the ACR level is just above
the threshold where the urine samples are concentrated, can
also be conﬁrmed with a ﬁrst morning void.

The numeric equivalence of ACR in mg/g (mg/mmol) to
approximately g/d is based on the simple assumption that
creatinine excretion rate (CER) approximates 1 gram/d (10
mmol/d). To better estimate urine albumin in individuals with
creatinine generation that is very different from the average, one
might consider measuring a timed urine collection if the value
would affect clinical decisions. As with assessment of GFR using
measured CrCl, use supervised urine collections. Alternatively,
equations are available that estimate creatinine generation from
prediction equations and then multiply that value by the ACR to
compute an estimated albumin excretion rate (AER) that ac-
commodates the lower or higher level of CER.299,300

Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended because
it is relatively standardized and because it is the single most
important protein lost in the urine in most CKDs. Use of
urinary albumin measurement as the preferred test for pro-
teinuria detection will improve the sensitivity, quality, and
consistency of approach to the early detection and manage-
ment of kidney disease.

Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total
protein are insufﬁciently sensitive for the reliable detection of
proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and are
only semiquantitative. Furthermore, there is no standardization
between manufacturers. The use of such strips should be
discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements
of albuminuria or proteinuria, or validated point-of-care de-
vices for urine albumin/ACR (Section 1.4). When used, reagent
strip results should be conﬁrmed by laboratory testing.

Although the reference point remains the accurately timed
24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a difﬁcult
procedure to control effectively and that inaccuracies in urinary
collection may contribute to errors in estimation of albumin
and/or protein losses. In practice, untimed urine samples are a
reasonable ﬁrst test for ascertainment of albuminuria. A ﬁrst
morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with
24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion, has relatively low
intraindividual variability, and is required to exclude the
diagnosis of orthostatic (postural) proteinuria. A random urine
sample is acceptable if no ﬁrst morning void sample is available.
The concentration of albumin or protein in a urine sample will
be affected by hydration (i.e., how diluted or concentrated a
urine sample is), and reporting the albumin or protein to the
creatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration and
reduce intraindividual variability.205,261,301,302

There is biological and analytical variability in urine albu-
min and urine protein loss. There are several biological factors
that affect urine albumin or protein loss, separate from kidney
disease (Table 16).259 All of these can lead to false detection of
CKD or its progression. Thus, positive tests should be
conﬁrmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD.
Large changes would be repeated to conﬁrm increasing urine
albumin and urine protein. Chapter 2 discusses
the
magnitude of change to be considered a real change given the
known biological and analytical variability.

There is also biological variability in urine creatinine
excretion. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can
also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently
of changes in protein loss. In general, urine creatinine mea-
surements are less susceptible to factors that interfere with
SCr assays. If a more accurate quantiﬁcation of albuminuria
or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin or
total protein in a timed collection under supervised condi-
tions as recommended above.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a ﬁrst morning
urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and pro-
teinuria (in descending order of preference):
(i) Both urine PCR and urine ACR,
(ii) Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for

albumin with automated reading, or

(iii) Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for

albumin with manual reading.

Consistent with the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice
Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic
Kidney Disease,1 PCR is advised and preferred as initial
screening for children as the majority of children have
underlying developmental abnormalities often referred to as
CAKUT and a much higher proportion of children than

generally reﬂects glomerular damage.304 Importantly, in the
context of
screening for children with diabetes, ACR
remains the standard, in line with adult guidelines.

The same considerations of using ﬁrst morning samples
(because of orthostatic proteinuria) and considering tran-
siently increased proteinuria during intercurrent illness or
after exercise apply to children as well as adults. Orthostatic
proteinuria is estimated to affect 2%–5% of adolescents.305

Age and body size are important for interpreting proteinuria
and albuminuria. In term and preterm neonates, PCR is high
(PCR 1000–3000 mg/g [100–300 mg/mmol]) in the ﬁrst days
and weeks of life, and is related to glomerular and tubular losses
of protein from immature nephrons, as well as very low creati-
nine from low muscle mass. Recent studies outline proteinuria
ranges for neonates, including for preterm and low-birth-weight
neonates. As the tubules mature, proteinuria slowly declines. In
general, a PCR of <500 mg/g (<50 mg/mmol) (or a 24-hour
protein of <150 mg/m2/d) is considered normal for infants aged
6 months to 2 years. For children over 2 years, a ﬁrst morning
urine PCR of <200 mg/g (<20 mg/mmol) protein, or <150 mg/
m2/d, or a ﬁrst morning urine ACR <30 mg/g (<3 mg/mmol) is
usually considered normal.83,306–309 More comprehensive values
can be found in Pediatric Nephrology.310

1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories

The following comments are focused on the laboratory
assessment of albuminuria, rather than total proteinuria, given
albumin measurement is the preferred approach to proteinuria
evaluation (Section 1.3.1.) However, some of these practice
points (sample type and storage, reporting as a PCR) would
apply equally to total protein measurement practices.

Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting
and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure
accuracy and reliability of the ﬁndings when assessing
urine samples.

Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external
quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and
creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred
practice for laboratories.

Adoption of the reporting and handling standards for
assessment of urine samples is of paramount importance to

reliability of urine samples

ensure that healthcare providers receive urine ACR reports in
a consistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracy
and reliability of the result.

Measurement of urine albumin for the detection of kidney
disease as with any analyte should be with methodology
traceable to international standards using a standard reference
material. This is currently not the case, and results may vary
by greater than 40% between laboratories depending on the
methodology used with attendant impact on the interpreta-
tion of reported results.

The type of urine collection and the analytical method
inﬂuence result interpretation. Twenty-four-hour urine col-
lections present problems
in terms of completeness of
collection, specimen storage, and timing accuracy. Therefore,
the assessment of ACR from a single void is a common and
convenient clinical practice. The ACR accounts for hydration
and has similar diagnostic performance to 24-hour urine
AER. The collection method should remain consistent, pref-
erably using the ﬁrst morning void specimen.

If specimens are being stored for future analysis, careful
attention must be paid to the storage conditions to avoid
degradation of albumin leading to quantiﬁcation error. The re-
ported effects of frozen storage on urine albumin are somewhat
inconsistent. Albumin is generally stable in urine stored at 2 (cid:4)C–8
(cid:4)C for 7 days. However, losses of albumin have been reported
when urine is stored frozen at temperatures higher than (cid:5)80 (cid:4)C.
Precipitates often form when urine is stored refrigerated or
frozen but can be redissolved on warming: samples should be
warmed to room temperature and mixed before analysis.290
Albumin losses may be affected by factors including period of
storage,
and individual
albumin concentration,
variation.311 It should be possible to provide refrigerated
storage and process samples for albumin measurement in a
laboratory within 7 days in most healthcare settings.

sample

The internationally accepted laboratory quality standards
are variably met worldwide, and laboratories are at different
levels with respect to quality. However, the Work Group placed
a high value on the accuracy and reliability of quantiﬁcation of
albuminuria and judged that people with CKD, their healthcare
providers, and policy makers would want laboratories to ach-
ieve these reporting and handling standards.

The direct costs of total protein measurement in urine are
lower than those of urine albumin. However, total protein
measurement lacks sensitivity for the detection of low but
clinically signiﬁcant levels of albuminuria. For this, and other
reasons discussed in Section 1.3.1, the measurement of ACR is
preferred to that of PCR.

the clinically relevant

Urine albumin should be measured using immunological
assays capable of speciﬁcally and precisely quantifying albu-
min at low concentrations and of producing quantitative re-
range. The biological
sults over
variation of urine albumin exceeds 60%. Target analytical
variation (CV) should be based on an optimal level of <0.25
biological variation, approximately 15%. This is in keeping
with good practice recommendations from the National
Academy of Clinical Biochemistry.312

Signiﬁcant progress has been made in developing a certi-
ﬁed reference material for urine albumin and a reference

commercially available assays for urine albumin are not
this reference material. Laboratories

should ensure that
they are enrolled and demonstrate
satisfactory performance in, an EQA scheme for urine
albumin, creatinine, and ACR.

However,

Urine albumin (and protein) concentrations in urine
should be reported as a ratio to creatinine—ACR (or PCR).
Reporting as a ratio to creatinine corrects for variations in
urinary ﬂow rate and enables reporting on untimed, spot
samples, obviating the need for timed, including 24-hour,
collections, which are prone to collection error and tedious
for people to undertake. Reporting albumin as a ratio to
creatinine reduces the intraindividual variability in albumin-
uria compared with reporting as albumin concentration alone
(mg/mmol or mg/g).315

To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare
systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number of
meaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach should
be used in relation to reporting units of ACR and PCR. ACR
results should be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol)
or whole numbers (mg/g). Both enzymatic and Jaffe assays
are generally suitable for the measurement of creatinine in
urine, although high concentrations of glucose can interfere
in Jaffe urine creatinine measurement and produce clinically
meaningful errors in ACR.

1.4 Point-of-care testing

Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of-
care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and
urine albumin measurement where access to a lab-
oratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of-
care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C).

Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for
creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same
preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria
relating to the specimen collection and performance of the
device,
including external quality assessment, and the
interpretation of the result is used.

Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine
testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use the
equation consistent with that used within the region.

Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for
albuminuria testing,
the capability of also analyzing
creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the
ability of the POCT ACR devices to produce a positive
result in 85% of people with signiﬁcant albuminuria (ACR
‡30 mg/g or ‡3 mg/mmol), as part of the evaluation and
consideration of using the device.

This recommendation places a high value on the advantages
of POCTs including convenience, elimination of sample trans-
portation to the central laboratory, minimal sample processing,
simple analytic process, minimal sample requirement, and im-
mediate availability of results. It places a lower value on the
limited and heterogeneous data related to their diagnostic
accuracy.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. POCTs for both creatinine
and urine albumin have several potential beneﬁts. POCT may
lead to earlier diagnosis, and as a result, earlier treatment of
CKD. They may also be used to monitor CKD progression,
which enables more timely treatment decisions. The rapid
reporting, low cost, and convenience to people with CKD
compared with central laboratory testing are also important
beneﬁts of POCTs. However, its provision can raise challenges
in relation to maintenance of analytical and diagnostic per-
formance, and governance arrangements. In addition, these
tests may be less accurate than laboratory testing, which may
lead to misdiagnosis, misclassiﬁcation, overtreatment, or
undertreatment. The balance of beneﬁts and harms needs
rigorous evaluation speciﬁc to each clinical situation.

For creatinine, the ERT identiﬁed a systematic review from
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE)/
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) diagnostic
guideline that evaluated point-of-care creatinine tests to assess
GFR before computed tomography (CT) scanning with
contrast media.316 The ERT also updated the ﬁndings of this
systematic review. The review from NICE/NIHR identiﬁed
and qualitatively synthesized data from 54 studies on
diagnostic accuracy: eGFR diagnostic accuracy (n ¼ 12),
SCr diagnostic accuracy (n ¼ 7), and correlation and bias
of POC creatinine tests compared with laboratory-based
tests (n ¼ 50). One study317 was identiﬁed in the update of
the NICE/NIHR review assessing POC creatinine test
compared with laboratory
in a pediatric
population with malaria in Uganda.

standards

These studies covered 3 types of devices: StatSensor, i-
STAT, and ABL devices. In general, all 3 devices demonstrated
acceptable accuracy at lower levels of eGFR (<30 ml/min per
1.73 m2).316 Results showed that i-STAT and ABL devices may
have higher probabilities of correctly classifying people in the
same eGFR categories as the laboratory reference than
StatSensor devices.

For albumin, the ERT identiﬁed a systematic review pub-
lished in 2014, by McTaggart et al.,318 that evaluated the
diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative
protein or albumin urine dipstick tests compared with
laboratory-based tests among people with suspected or
diagnosed CKD. The ERT included relevant studies from
this review and conducted an update.

Sixty-ﬁve studies (in 66 articles)319–344,345–368,369–384 eval-
uated the accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative pro-
tein or albumin dipstick tests in a general population not on

KRT or receiving end-of-life care. Studies addressed the
following critical outcomes: measurement bias (n ¼ 1),
analytical variability (n ¼ 5), analytical sensitivity (n ¼ 2),
and analytic speciﬁcity (n ¼ 63) (Supplementary Table
S5336,347,363,372,373,377,382–384). Speciﬁcity ranged from 17.5 to
99.5 when evaluative ACR $30 mg/g ($3 mg/mmol) and
30.0–98.7 when evaluative ACR $300 mg/g ($30 mg/
mmol). For PCR, speciﬁcity ranged from 80.8–96.9 when
evaluative PCR >200 mg/g (>20 mg/mmol) and 75.6–95.2
when evaluative PCR >500 mg/g (>50 mg/mol).

The evidence regarding the performance of POCT for
creatinine and urine albumin is heterogeneous limiting the
determination of overall ﬁndings across these critical out-
comes. However, given the cost-effectiveness beneﬁts, avail-
ability of the test in the absence of laboratory studies, and the
acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that in
speciﬁc clinical scenarios, POCT should be used.

Certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence for POCT
for creatinine testing was rated as low due to consistent
reporting of reference standards across all outcomes, with
some concerns regarding patient selection and ﬂow and
timing and directness of the evidence. The certainty of evi-
dence regarding performance of all POCT for urine albumin
was very low based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic
Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) assessment of
individual
studies due to sparse data, heterogeneous ﬁndings, and con-
cerns about patient
index tests, and unclear
reporting of the reference standards.

selection,

Values and preferences. The recommendation suggested
that the majority of people with CKD who have limited access
to laboratories would choose to use POCT. These tests may
facilitate people with CKD being seen at home or in remote
settings. Many people with CKD will value the immediate
results available with POCT versus waiting for the tests from a
lab. In addition, some people with CKD will place a higher
value on avoiding expensive lab tests that may not be covered
by their insurance, difﬁcult travel to central healthcare facil-
ities, and exposure to infection risk in hospital. These people
with CKD may also place a lower value on the potential
inaccuracies associated with POCTs compared with in-center
laboratory testing.

Resource use and costs. For people with CKD, the use of
POCTs may be less expensive than tests conducted in a
clinical laboratory. In areas with limited access to healthcare
and insurance, these tests may be cost saving and increase the
detection for CKD.385,386 For the healthcare system, some
direct reagent and staff costs of POCT tend to be higher on
a per test basis than those of centralized laboratory testing,
but these costs may be offset by other savings in the clinical

pathway, for example, through more rapid disease detection
or avoidance of hospital referral.

Considerations for

implementation. POCTs may not be
available everywhere. Support from the local laboratory ser-
vice should be sought to guide the purchase, evaluation,
implementation, governance, and ongoing quality assurance
of POCT. The ability to test creatinine in a person’s home may
have applicability to “virtual ward” settings (hospital at
home).

It is worth noting that for albuminuria testing, the Na-
tional Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has proposed that
devices should have 95% sensitivity for the detection of
albuminuria.312 This is not always achieved by POCT devices,
especially those that produce semiquantitative results.318

Rationale
POCT can be carried out in a wide range of settings including
primary care, community clinics, rural communities, and
secondary care supporting timely diagnosis, monitoring, and
treatment. Importantly, in locations where laboratory services
may be limited or nonexistent (e.g., rural and remote com-
munities), the ability to test versus not testing blood and
urine was important. Advantages of POCT include conve-
nience, elimination of sample transportation to the central
laboratory, minimal sample processing because the analysis is
of whole blood/urine, simple analytic process, minimal
sample requirement, and immediate availability of results.
However, these tests may be prone to errors and inaccuracies.
For these reasons, the recommendation suggests the use of
these tests based on the speciﬁc clinical need or geographical/
social circumstances.

Use of POCT may facilitate access to earlier diagnosis and,
thus, care and can be implemented in rural and remote lo-
cations. The value of POCT for currently underserved pop-
ulations cannot be overstated and should include the capacity
for generating creatinine-based eGFR equations. The POCT
devices used would ideally measure both blood creatinine and
urine for albumin and creatinine to measure ACR and be
standardized and calibrated with similar rigor as is recom-
mended for laboratory tests.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. The ability to use a small sample
volume, ﬁngerprick sample as opposed to venipuncture, may
have applicability to testing in children.

Monitoring CKD through the surveillance of albuminuria

and GFR serves to update staging for prognosis,
timing of intervention strategies, and assess the effectiveness
of speciﬁc treatments. No clear threshold deﬁnes a clinically
relevant change in GFR or albuminuria, as any worsening
could reﬂect deterioration in kidney health. However, over-
interpretation of small changes in these measures may lead to
unnecessary changes in clinical management that could be
unhelpful or even deleterious. Education for healthcare pro-
viders and people with CKD about the variability of speciﬁc
laboratory measurements in kidney disease is important to
facilitate understanding
inappropriate
changes in treatment strategies due to nonclinically signiﬁcant
ﬂuctuations in either positive or negative directions.

the observed change is clinically signiﬁcant progression of
CKD or is within biological and analytical variability of the

Previous guidelines have suggested the routine monitoring
of albuminuria and GFR. Prior guidelines have suggested
annual monitoring for those with CKD G1–G2, every 6
months for those with CKD G3, every 3 months for CKD G4,
and every 6 weeks for CKD G5 disease. Given the greater risk
of disease progression, those with higher risk of disease
progression should undergo more frequent monitoring
(Figure 1329). More frequent monitoring may be indicated in

change value (RCV) is deﬁned as the threshold of change
that differs from the individual’s prior value with 95% CI;
in a cohort of people with CKD, eGFRcr and eGFRcys had
RCVs ranging from 14%–20% in the positive and negative
directions. Although attention to progressive loss of eGFR is
important, smaller changes in GFR may not be related to
true changes in kidney health, especially if transient and
require cautious interpretation.

Thresholds for CKD progression used in clinical trials and
epidemiological studies are different than those suggested for
monitoring of people with CKD. In research studies, 30%–
40% declines in GFR have been associated with increased risk
for kidney failure, and treatment effects on these endpoints
have been associated with changes in risk for kidney failure.
Because these are evaluated at the group level, small errors in
individual people with CKD are minimized.

Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate
hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of
>30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability
and warrant evaluation.

Acute eGFR decline after intensive BP control has been
observed in people with CKD, with reductions of 10%–20%
being typical within the ﬁrst 3 months of treatment. These
declines in eGFR are hemodynamically mediated, represent-
ing a response to BP falling below the lower threshold of a
person’s autoregulatory response. For many,
initial
decline in eGFR is transient and will stabilize or resolve over
time, as resetting of the autoregulatory function occurs. Thus,
acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of <20%–30% are
expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents,
which may be important for cardio- and kidney-protective
effects in the long term. This phenomenon is especially
common when using ACEi/angiotensin II receptor blockers
(ARBs), as they both lower BP and alter arteriolar ﬂow
through the glomeruli, and SGLT2i through similar hemo-
dynamic mechanisms.

this

Post hoc analyses of trials of SGLT2i treatment in people with
diabetes, heart failure, and CKD suggested that participants
with >10% initial drop in eGFR have similar eGFR trajectories
and kidney beneﬁts
from SGLT2i compared with the

“nondipper” who received SGLT2i, except in unusual cases
when the acute “dip” in eGFR was >30% from baseline.389,390
These ﬁndings were consistent across all subgroups.

A signiﬁcant drop in eGFR (>30%) while initiating anti-
hypertensive agents,
renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
(RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or
SGLT2i should prompt a review into other causes and war-
rants close monitoring. However, healthcare providers should
avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents,
particularly because these earlier “dips” are typically reversible
and not an indication of drug toxicity.

Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people
with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test
exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

Small ﬂuctuations in albuminuria or proteinuria levels
may not indicate disease progression. Appreciation of factors
that impact albuminuria and changes in the measure is
important for healthcare providers. Routine surveillance us-
ing ACR or PCR is warranted in higher risk people with CKD,
as changes in urine ACR are associated with kidney failure.
Speciﬁcally, in large population studies, a doubling of the
ACR within a 2-year duration is associated with an increase in
the risk of progression to kidney failure by 50%–100%.391,392

ESCAPE228

A 50% reduction of proteinuria within the ﬁrst 2 months of treatment initiation more than halved the risk of progression of kidney

disease over 5 years.

Gluck et al.225 In a cohort of over 7 million children, 0.1% had CKD G2 or higher. The relative risk of CKD progression, deﬁned as reaching CKD G5 or

having a 50% decline in eGFR, was doubled for those who had $1þ proteinuria on dipstick without hypertension and was
quadrupled for those with proteinuria and hypertension over a median follow-up of 5 years.

CKiD393

ACR of >300 mg/g (>30 mg/mmol) was associated with an 84% higher risk of disease progression over a median follow-up of 3 years
compared with an ACR of 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol). PCR of 630 mg/g (71 mg/mmol) was associated with an 87% higher risk of
disease progression compared with a PCR of 140 mg/g (16 mg/mmol).

with advanced CKD.

survival over 5 years in the lower proteinuria groups: 97% and 94% vs. 45%.

Special considerations

Pediatric

considerations. Increases

in albuminuria and
proteinuria are also associated with increased risk of disease
progression in pediatric populations. A number of studies in
pediatric subjects detailed in Table 18225,228,393–398 highlight
the value of measurement of albuminuria/proteinuria.

Considerations in older adults. Urine ACR in older adult
population may be elevated due to the loss of muscle mass
leading to lower SCr and lower urinary CrCl. In older adults
or people with frailty, the interpretation of urine ACR should
take into consideration age-related changes in muscle mass
and/or sarcopenia.

2.2 Risk prediction in people with CKD
The CKD staging heatmaps reﬂect RRs for each CKD cate-
gory compared with persons who do not have CKD at a
population level; however, a person’s absolute risk for each
outcome requires the use of risk prediction equations for the
speciﬁc adverse event.

Individual-level risk prediction can inform key clinical de-
cisions, improve the patient-healthcare provider dialogue, and
enable personalized care for persons with CKD.399 The heatmap
introduced in the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline
concept

in populations,

emphasizes the RR of adverse outcomes by levels of eGFR and
and encourages healthcare
albuminuria
providers to classify those people with CKD as high risk for
kidney, cardiovascular, and other adverse events based on those
2 parameters.400 The heatmaps also reinforce the importance
to all of using both eGFR and ACR for assessing severity and
prognosis of CKD and are color-coded to indicate those RRs in
populations but do not enable individual risk prediction.

However, the people within a speciﬁc “cell” on the grid or
within an eGFR/ACR category have a wide range of absolute
risks for each of the adverse outcomes of interest. An indi-
vidual person’s risk for each outcome is inﬂuenced by their
underlying etiology of CKD, demographic characteristics,
comorbid conditions, and other factors including lifestyle,
SES, nutrition, and intercurrent events. Thus, the RRs shown
in the heatmap tables can be crudely interpreted as a multi-
plier superimposed upon the aforementioned other charac-
teristics. There can be substantial variability and overlap, up
to 8000% in the risk of CKD progression or 4000% in the risk
of kidney failure, for 2 people in the same heatmap category
or CKD stage (Figure 14401,402)402; therefore, individual risk
prediction using accurate and externally validated risk
equations is important in the personalization of care and
can be used to inform absolute risk for individual people.

The corollary to individualizing absolute risks versus RRs
is appreciating the absolute versus relative beneﬁts of disease-
modifying therapies. Although the relative beneﬁts of medi-
cations such as SGLT2i may appear similar across subgroups,
the actual beneﬁt on speciﬁc outcomes is highest among
people who have
that
outcome.403 Risk prediction equations can be used to better
identify these people and perform better than healthcare

Recommendation 2.2.1: In people with CKD G3–G5,
we recommend using an externally validated risk
equation to estimate the absolute risk of kidney
failure (1A).

This recommendation places a high value on the need and po-
tential beneﬁts for individual risk prediction to deliver person-
alized care for people with CKD. The recommendation is worded
to encourage healthcare providers, patients, researchers, and
policy makers to go beyond broad categories of RR for popula-
tion and to estimate the absolute risk of outcomes for each in-
dividual. The recommendation also places a high value on
externally validated prediction equations that can be applied in
diverse healthcare settings and the need for implementation
science in laboratory information systems and EMRs to enable
the delivery of risk-based care for people with CKD.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. There is a large body of
evidence to support the use of the validated risk equations to
estimate the absolute risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis
or transplant in people with CKD G3–G5. Risk equations
using routinely collected data have been developed, externally
validated, and implemented in labs, EMRs, and health
systems.408,412,413

and described the variables

Multiple systematic reviews and quality assessments of risk
prediction equations have been performed in the last 10 years,
with the most recent review published in 2020.405 This review
included 35 development studies and 17 external validation
included in the
studies,
prediction models and provided a decision aid for selecting
the best model
the prediction horizon and the
underlying etiology of kidney disease. More recently, an
additional externally validated model using serum cystatin
C has also been developed in Germany and externally
validated in 3 European cohorts.409 A summary of
externally validated models for kidney failure is provided
below and in Table 19.9,10,407–411

for

We highlight here 3 validated models, The Kidney Failure
Risk Equation (KFRE), the Veterans Affairs model, and the Z6
Score model. All of these use routinely collected data from
labs or EMRs and have been validated in different pop-
ulations, both in North America and internationally to
varying degrees. Detailed review of all existing prediction
models is beyond the scope of this document.

The KFRE was developed and initially validated in 8391 adults
from 2 Canadian provinces, and subsequently validated in
721,357 individuals from more than 30 countries spanning 4
continents.9,10 In this large validation study, cohorts from both
general populations and nephrology clinic settings were
included. Discrimination was excellent (C-statistic >0.80 in 28/
30 cohorts), and the use of a calibration factor improved
calibration for some regions outside of North America; the
validation populations now exceed 2 million individuals in
more than 60 cohorts from nearly every continent.407,408 The
KFRE is consistently highly accurate and has not been improved
by the addition of longitudinal slopes or variability of eGFR and
urine ACR, or by adding cardiovascular comorbidities.407

A further 2 externally validated models from large US
health systems (Kaiser Permanente North West and Veterans
Affairs) also use routinely collected data and predict kidney
failure with high accuracy within a 5-year horizon.410,414 Only
1 externally validated model for kidney failure has been
developed using serum cystatin C (Z6 model), and although
it is highly accurate in 4 European cohorts, it has not been
validated in other continents.409

and healthcare providers

The Work Group judged that the published externally vali-
dated models (delineated in Table 199,10,407–411) all had
sufﬁcient accuracy to be used in clinical settings. Given the
potential beneﬁts and utility of knowing the risk of kidney
failure, patients
should be
encouraged to use these tools. Assessing risk of progression
can aid in optimizing healthcare delivery services, facilitate
the earlier identiﬁcation of individuals for disease-modifying
therapy, help with planning for modality education, and
identify goals of care planning. There are limited but
supportive
studies describing the better prediction of
outcomes when using risk equations compared with care that
is delivered according to isolated eGFR values and clinical
from the use of prediction
judgment. Potential harms
equations could result from inappropriate use in the settings

of AKI or AKD or in younger individuals with CKD G1–G2
who may be at high risk of progression but low risk of kidney
failure in the next 5 years. In these people, more proximal
outcomes such as 40% decline in GFR or lifetime risk were
judged to be more appropriate (i.e., establishing a validated
risk equation for the appropriate outcome of interest, derived
from the population of
interest). As described above,
healthcare providers should be cognizant of the impact of
biological and analytical variability in albuminuria and eGFR
values and the subsequent impact on calculation of predicted
risk of kidney failure.

Certainty of the evidence. To assess the certainty of evidence,
the ERT examined 2 existing systematic reviews addressing the
question of the ability of risk prediction models to predict
kidney failure (see Supplementary Table S6).406,415 The 2021
review from NICE in the United Kingdom (UK) assessed the
certainty of evidence for a variety of risk-based equations to
predict kidney failure and concluded that there was high-
quality evidence to state that the chosen risk prediction
equations accurately predict kidney failure.415 There was high
certainty of the evidence (C-statistics were high, and the CIs
were narrow). The Tangri 2013 review did not assess the
certainty of evidence as part of the review (Supplementary
Tables S6–S99,85,89,94,96,408,416).406

The Work Group agreed with the NICE assessment and
considered evidence from other systematic reviews and
recently published validation studies. The certainty of evi-
dence was based on the established and growing evidence base
for clinical validation and clinical utility as well as feasibility
for validated risk prediction equations that predict kidney
failure.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that the
accurate prediction of kidney failure was of importance to
people with CKD, their families, and healthcare providers,
and that most people with CKD would choose to receive
prognostic information about their individual risk of kidney
failure as part of routine care. For a global guideline, the Work
Group focused on prediction equations that were externally
validated, had a low risk of bias, and included variables that
were routinely available in most healthcare settings.

information on demographics

Resource use and costs. Most externally validated risk
equations for predicting kidney failure use routinely collected
data including laboratory variables such as eGFR, albumin-
uria, and serum albumin, phosphate, calcium, or hemoglo-
bin, or
and comorbid
conditions that can be easily obtained. As such, these models
can be easily implemented at low cost to health systems. Only
1 externally validated model (Z6 Score) used cystatin C, and
its usability in global health will depend on the potential
increased routine availability of cystatin C in laboratories
worldwide.

Considerations

implementation. Given the potential
value of risk prediction models for planning and care de-
cisions, healthcare providers should consider how to integrate
risk prediction models into clinical practice, either in EMRs,
laboratory information systems, or using other mechanisms

S200

(mobile apps). These should aid clinical workﬂow and deci-
sion-making and even patient understanding. Where possible,
laboratories should report the results from a validated risk
equation speciﬁc to the region automatically for individuals
with CKD G3–G5 when the required variables are available.
Simpler equations can be implemented and reported when
minimal data are available and more complex equations,
requiring additional variables, can be implemented if the
required data are present.

The reporting of risk in the laboratory reports and EMRs
should be standardized with appropriate guidance on risk
thresholds, when available. Local validation studies can be
performed to determine optimal calibration of the speciﬁc
Imple-
risk prediction equations before implementation.
mentation of risk equations that are externally validated and
use routinely collected data should be prioritized for health
equity and global health considerations.

Rationale
Risk prediction equations that are externally validated, and
locally calibrated, when possible, can lead to improvement in
the delivery of CKD care. These equations should be used as
they can further personalize care plans for people with CKD
and enable discussions about the beneﬁts and harms of dis-
ease-modifying therapy.

This is a strong recommendation, as the Work Group
judged that the evidence supporting both the clinical validity
and clinical utility of risk prediction equations was sufﬁciently
strong to recommend widespread adoption. The Work Group
judged that most externally validated equations rely on
routinely collected data and could therefore be implemented
equally in low-resource settings. The Work Group also judged
that the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calcu-
lating the risk of kidney failure and discussing the risk and
related treatment decisions with patients and caregivers.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. Work from the CKiD group (2015)
provides a risk calculator for disease progression, using age, sex,
glomerular versus nonglomerular disease, eGFR, hypertension
and laboratory parameters (calculator available at https://www.

kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculatorPedRiskCalc).417
Further analyses combining the CKiD data with that from the
ESCAPE trial (of BP control in CKD progression in children)
resulted in a risk calculator that uses diagnosis, eGFR and
proteinuria, and can be accessed at www.ckdprognosis.

Considerations regarding sex and gender. There is uncer-
tainty around whether sex assigned at birth or gender identity
is to be used in risk equations. At present, a holistic approach
should be used that takes into account sex assigned at birth,
sex hormone milieu, and gender identity with shared deci-
sion-making with the person with CKD.

Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3%–5%
can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in
addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other
clinical considerations.

In most developing and developed countries, there are
insufﬁcient nephrology care resources to manage all people
with CKD. Using an objective tool to appropriately triage
those most likely to beneﬁt from referral may help to manage
those nephrology resources in an evidence-informed manner.
Because only a small fraction of the CKD population is at
high risk for progression to kidney failure, those people with
lower risks of progression to kidney failure may be effectively
managed in primary care settings with guideline-based
treatments to delay CKD progression (Figure 15). Referral
criteria for nephrology services that include a risk threshold
of 3%–5% over 5 years have been examined retrospectively
and have also been implemented prospectively in several
healthcare settings.420,421

In settings within Canada and the UK, retrospective
studies have found that the use of these risk thresholds has
avoided harms from nonreferral or delayed referral of those
progressing to kidney failure.412 In addition, prospective
evaluation has demonstrated a reduction in nephrology

Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10%
can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary
care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical
considerations.

People with CKD G4–G5 are more likely to develop con-
current complications of CKD including anemia, hyper-
kalemia, bone mineral disorders, and/or metabolic acidosis
and protein-energy wasting. In addition, they remain at high
risk for adverse events including AKI, emergency department
visits, and hospitalizations. As such, in many countries and
healthcare settings, these people may be enrolled in inter-
disciplinary care clinics or receive care management resources
to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs, and to avoid un-
planned dialysis initiation.

A risk threshold risk of >10% over 2 years has been
studied and implemented in some jurisdictions in Canada as
the key eligibility criteria for access to interdisciplinary care
that includes a nurse, pharmacist, renal dietitian or accredited
nutrition provider, and other allied health support. This
practice point is based on results from these studies, which
demonstrate acceptance and preference of a risk-based
criteria by patients and providers.422 Given the costs
associated with delivery of care management resources and
interdisciplinary models, risk-based thresholds offer a useful
guide to the selection of the ideal target patient population
to derive most beneﬁt from the highly specialized team. It
is important to note that people with CKD at earlier stages
or those at lower risk of progression may beneﬁt from an
individual
(e.g., pharmacist or
dietitian); however, risk-based thresholds provide a guide to
identify people with CKD who beneﬁt most from an entire
multidisciplinary team.

allied health resource

Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold
of >40% can be used to determine the modality education,
timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy
(KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for
transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and
other clinical considerations.

The appropriate timing for modality education, timing of
vascular access planning, or referral for transplantation in a
person with low or declining GFR can be difﬁcult to predict.
Vascular access planning in all adults with CKD G4 would
lead to the unnecessary placement of ﬁstulae, whereas waiting
until eGFR falls below 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may lead to
inappropriate overuse of central venous catheters at dialysis
initiation. Studies have described the potential utility of risk-
based thresholds in planning for dialysis access speciﬁcally

and found acceptable speciﬁcity and positive predictive values
for the risk-based threshold criteria as compared with eGFR
alone. The Work Group noted that the KDOQI vascular ac-
cess guideline (2019) currently recommend a risk-based
threshold >50% or eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for
initiation of vascular access planning, while acknowledging
that access to surgeons and primary failure to maturation
rates may vary by patient and by center.423

Based on current evidence, a threshold of >40% risk or an
eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is acceptable to use for
initiating vascular access referral. Lower risk thresholds, such
as >20%, can optimize sensitivity, can be used to initiate
modality education, and may be appropriate for presurgical
vascular access planning or referral for transplantation in
centers with longer wait times.

Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations
developed for use in people with CKD G3–G5, may not be
valid for use in those with CKD G1–G2.

The Work Group recognizes that the progression of CKD
can occur at all severities, and that in earlier stages of disease
(G1–G3), large declines in eGFR can occur in 2- to 5-year
time frames without reaching kidney failure (Figure 16424).
Risk prediction models developed in populations with later
stages of CKD are not accurate in CKD G1–G2, whereas
alternative, accurate, externally validated risk prediction
equations have been developed for predicting 40% decline in
eGFR or kidney failure at all stages of CKD. For this

tions present models for people with or without diabetes,
using both regression and machine learning–based methods,
with or without biomarkers (Table 20).8,424,425 Given the
potential utility of these new models to identify high-risk
people for early intervention, they should be used to predict
disease progression in people with CKD G1–G2 and may
supplement established risk equations among people with
CKD G3. People with CKD identiﬁed as intermediate risk
(e.g., >1% per year) with these tools may beneﬁt from the
earlier initiation of therapy and closer follow-up, and those
identiﬁed as high risk (e.g., >5% per year) may have the
largest beneﬁt from multidrug therapy to slow progression.

Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speciﬁc, externally vali-
dated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin
A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease (ADPKD).

Risk prediction models for speciﬁc etiologies of CKD have
also been developed, are externally validated, and used in
healthcare settings to guide clinical care. For autosomal domi-
nant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 2 equations can be
useful in determining the longer-term risk of kidney failure and
may guide therapy with tolvaptan—the Mayo Clinic Classiﬁ-
cation tool and the Predicting Renal Outcome in Polycystic
Kidney Disease (PROPKD) score,426,427 which incorporates
genetic data. Of these, the Mayo Clinic Classiﬁcation tool has
been shown to be accurate in external validation.

In people with IgAN, 2 externally validated prediction
tools (clinical or clinical þ histology) have been developed
using large international cohort studies. Models that included
the mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hyper-
cellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular at-
rophy/interstitial ﬁbrosis (T) (MEST) histological score were
more accurate (C-statistic: 0.81–0.82 vs. 0.78) and showed
improved reclassiﬁcation in development and external vali-
dation datasets.428,429 Given the availability of accurate
externally validated models, these should be preferentially
used over more general CKD models in people with an
established diagnosis of IgAN or ADPKD. It is important to
the clinical presentation of IgAN can include
note that
rapidly progressive disease,
and people with rapidly
progressive GN may not have been well represented in the
cohorts used to develop existing prediction tools.

2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with
CKD

Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to
guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use externally
validated models that are either developed within CKD
populations or that incorporate eGFR and albuminuria.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality disproportion-
ately affect people with CKD, and risk prediction tools
developed in the general (non-CKD) population may un-
derestimate the risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) or
heart failure in CKD populations. Absolute risk is used to
determine eligibility for disease-modifying pharmacological
therapy in CVD guidelines, and underestimation of risk may
lead to suboptimal treatment of people with CKD, perpetu-
ating biases (“renalism”) that have existed for more than 2
decades. New models that have been developed speciﬁcally in
adults with CKD (QRISK3430) and severe CKD (ckdpc.org),6
and modiﬁcations to existing CVD models (pooled cohort
equations
[PCE]/Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation
[SCORE]431) that include eGFR and albuminuria should be
used to predict cardiovascular events in individuals with
CKD.390–393,427,428,430,431,432 In the case of
the
CKD patch signiﬁcantly improves the calibration of ASCVD
risk, and the eGFR patch improves the prediction of CVD

separately).433,434 These equations included eGFR in the
primary model and included ACR in an add-on model, so
they may be particularly appropriate for people with CKD.

the PCE,

Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide
discussions about goals of care, use externally validated
models that predict all-cause mortality speciﬁcally devel-
oped in the CKD population.

People with CKD are at high risk of all-cause mortality,
and the competing risk of death can affect clinical decision-
making, particularly for older adults with CKD G4, who may
simultaneously be at high risk of kidney failure requiring
dialysis. All-cause mortality can be challenging to predict due
in
to the multiple biological pathways and differences

identify high-risk groups, where earlier discussions about
conservative care pathways or alternative goals of care may
have been helpful. These models should not be used to
determine the futility of initiating KRT.

abnormalities

Risk factors associated with CKD progression, CVD, and
other CKD complications are highly interrelated,435 and
hence so is their management. We use the term “CKD
treatment and risk modiﬁcation” to encompass the aim of
CKD treatment, which is to impart meaningful beneﬁcial
effects on “CKD manifestations” and on “CKD outcomes”
(Figure 17). CKD manifestations include symptoms and
associated with CKD,
clinical/laboratory
which confer health implications. These include increased
BP, anemia, dyslipidemia, CKD-mineral and bone disorder
(CKD-MBD),
acidosis,
decreased fertility, and increased risk of complications of
pregnancy. CKD outcomes refer to progression to kidney
failure and CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. These
are wide ranging and include several CVDs, hospitalization,
infections, and gout. Reducing the risk of CKD progression
by targeting its underlying pathophysiology may have
beneﬁcial effects on a range of CKD manifestations and
CKD-associated outcomes, although some complications
may need speciﬁc targeted interventions. Healthcare systems

This practice point calls out the need for a comprehensive
and integrated approach to lifestyle modiﬁcation and recog-
nizes that in some circumstances, there is value in referring
people to professionals or programs with expertise in lifestyle
modiﬁcation. We also appreciate that different healthcare
systems and regions will have variable access
to such
specialized services or teams, and thus availability may be an
issue.

3.2.1 Avoiding use of tobacco products
The Work Group concurs with the previous KDIGO recom-
mendations to advise people with diabetes and CKD who use

tobacco to quit using tobacco products23 and extends that advice
to all people with CKD who use tobacco products to reduce the
risk of associated premature mortality from CVD, as well as risk
of respiratory diseases and cancer.437 Intensive nurse-led
programs appear effective at supporting smoking abstinence
and can be combined with pharmacological intervention (e.g.,
therapy of nicotine-receptor partial
nicotine replacement
agonists) to improve smoking abstinence over 16 weeks.438 See

3.2.2 Physical activity and optimum weight
The Work Group concurs with all the recommendation and
practice points relating to physical activity from the KDIGO
2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management
in Chronic Kidney Disease23 and considers that they should
extend to all adults with CKD. We draw attention to the
following statements:

Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that peo-
ple with CKD be advised to undertake moderate-
intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration
of at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level
compatible with their cardiovascular and physical
tolerance (1D).

Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical ac-
tivity should consider age, ethnic background, presence of
other comorbidities, and access to resources.

Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised
to avoid sedentary behavior.

Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls,
healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensity
of physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and the
type of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both).

Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/
encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight.
BMI relates to levels of adiposity on a population scale (though
imperfectly), and a BMI of over 25 kg/m2 in adults (i.e., overweight
or obese) is associated with an increased risk of multiple chronic
diseases including development of CKD.439,440 Such adiposity-
can
CKD associations
overestimate risk in people with high muscle mass,443 and risk
for a given BMI may vary by ethnicity (with Asians being at
higher
than
Europeans).443,444 Nevertheless, it is important to provide people
with CKD advice about their weight using BMI in conjunction
with other information, including ethnicity, diet, comorbidity,
physical activity levels, risk of falls, and laboratory values.

Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD to
undertake physical activity aiming for World Health Or-
ganization (WHO)–advised levels (i.e., ‡60 minutes daily)
and to achieve a healthy weight.

The WHO recommends 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity daily for children 5–17 years old, including aer-
obic activities as well as activities that strengthen muscle and
bone.445 Limits on sedentary time, particularly screen time, are
also recommended. For children 1–5 years of age, 180 minutes
per day of physical activity is recommended; young children in

this age group should not be restrained (i.e., in a stroller or
carrier) for >60 minutes at a time. Only 13.4% of 224
participants of the CKiD study aged $12 years (median: 15
years) met these WHO targets,240,257,303,305,446 compared with
25% of general population children of comparable age.447 Less

has numerous beneﬁts for cardiovascular, mental, and social
health. Given that children with CKD are at higher risk for
problems in all these areas, physical activity may be even more
important in the CKD population.

3.3 Diet

Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt
healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of
plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and a
lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods.

Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited
nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about di-
etary adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potas-
sium, and protein intake, tailored to their individual needs,
and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions.

Plant-based diets use proportionately more plant-based food
choices, and animal-based food is consumed in moderation.
Diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat
dairy foods. A Mediterranean diet pattern is built around
vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, whole grains, and seafood
but also includes moderate amounts of dairy, meat, and eggs.
By deﬁnition, vegan and vegetarian diets are plant-based. A
whole-food, plant-based diet low in animal-based and ultra-
processed foods may be helpful to slow the progression of CKD
and delay need for dialysis via reduction of cardiometabolic risk
factors such as hypertension, CVD, diabetes, and obesity.448,449
Ultraprocessed foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fast
foods, frozen meals, chips, candy, and pastries are high in
salt, sugar, and fat, and low in nutritional value, and they
promote inﬂammation, which may contribute to worsening
kidney
rich in anti-
inﬂammatory nutrients, ﬁber, and phytochemicals, and has
been shown to reduce proteinuria and decrease metabolic
acidosis.448,449 The probiotic nature of plant-based foods may
also support the microbiome and reduce inﬂammation and
intestinal production of uremic toxins.450 A recent systematic
review evaluated the association of dietary patterns and
kidney-related outcomes.451,452 Dietary patterns that include

3.3.1 Protein intake

Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a
protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults
with CKD G3–G5 (2C).

Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake (>1.3 g/kg
body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression.

Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing
and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, consider
prescribing, under close supervision, a very low–protein
(0.3–0.4 g/kg body weight/d) supplemented with
diet
essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kg
body weight/d).

Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low–
protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD.

This recommendation places a higher value on slowing the
rate of GFR decline without the challenges associated with
adherence to lower-protein diets, potential adverse effects, and
the contraindications in people with sarcopenia, cachexia, or
undernutrition. The Work Group judged that many well-
informed people with CKD G3–G5 would choose to implement
this recommendation.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. The Work Group considered
that maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per
day in adults in the absence of indications for a higher or
lower protein intake was congruent with a person’s culture
and QoL. Considerations for protein restriction in the context
of individual preferences, true impact on CKD progression
based on etiology, and other factors need to be considered
and weighed against any potential adverse impacts, such as
malnutrition.

In many societies, most adults and older adults consume
more protein than recommended, with average protein intakes
of 1.2 g/kg/d.453,454 There is general agreement that, in the
absence of intercurrent disease, the protein requirements for
people with CKD are not different from those of healthy
subjects.455 The Work Group thus suggests maintaining a
protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d, a target consistent
with the WHO Recommended Dietary Allowances for the
general population.456,457 Figure 1923 shows some examples

the amount of protein in grams

that would be
of
recommended based on body weight. Clinicians should
advise people with CKD not to confuse grams of protein per
day with the weight of food in grams (i.e., 100 g of meat
contains only approximately 25 g of protein; Figure 2023).

and

Unlike carbohydrates and fats, excess dietary proteins
cannot be stored in the body and are catabolized, leading to
accumulation of protein waste products such as urea and
other uremic toxins. As CKD progresses, these byproducts
accumulate and affect organ function. High-protein intake
also contributes to increased intraglomerular pressure and
glomerular hyperﬁltration, which, in turn, may lead to glo-
injury.458,459
merulosclerosis
Progressive decline in kidney function is also associated
with a spontaneous loss of appetite potentially leading to
inadequate protein and energy intake.460 The Work Group
therefore encourages maintaining protein intake in adults
with CKD within the recommended range around 0.8 g/kg
body weight/d, and particularly avoiding excess protein
(>1.3 g/kg of body weight/d), which may be
intakes
harmful for the kidney.455 There is observational evidence
suggesting that excess protein intake may accelerate kidney
functional decline.461–463

tubulointerstitial

The protein type, not only the quantity, may also be
relevant. Table 21 brieﬂy summarizes the impact of plant-
based diets in people with CKD.464–470 In another cohort
study of older subjects (N ¼ 291, mean age 76 years) with
eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, there was no signiﬁcant
association between vegetable protein intake and change in

have associated a higher plant-based protein relative to
animal-based protein consumption or adherence to plant-
based protein dominant diets with slower eGFR decline
over time and lower risk of death; no study so far has
assessed the measures of patient preferences.471 It is unclear
whether
the associations are attributed to plant-based
protein intake per se or to other nutrients or lifestyle habits
that
the plant-based protein intervention;
however, there is biological plausibility. A crossover study of
10 healthy individuals fed for 3 weeks evaluated the effect
of a plant-based protein diet versus an animal-based protein
diet on kidney function parameters. Both diets provided the
total protein per day. Compared with
same amount of
animal-based protein, a plant-based protein diet reduced
renal plasma ﬂow, increased renal vascular resistance, and
lowered the fractional clearance of albumin.472,473

symptoms, such as metabolic acidosis and phosphate load.476
The Work Group considers that the evidence does not sup-
port a recommendation to follow low-protein diets alone (i.e.,
0.4–0.6 g/kg of body weight/d) as a strategy to slow the pro-
gression of CKD. In a meta-analysis of people with CKD without
diabetes,477 a low-protein diet compared with a normal-protein
diet in participants with CKD G3a and G3b (9 studies) or CKD
G4 (1 study) found little or no difference in mortality or eGFR

participants who reached kidney failure (6 studies, 1814
participants: RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.73–1.53). Similar null
associations were observed in a meta-analysis of 8 studies
involving people with diabetes and CKD.478

However, there is some evidence that very low–protein diets
(i.e., 0.3–0.4 g/kg of body weight/d) under strict supervision
can favorably impact kidney outcomes. A meta-analysis of
studies including people with CKD G4–G5 without diabetes
reported that very low–protein diets compared with low-pro-
tein diet or normal-protein diet may reduce the number of
people who reach kidney failure (10 studies, 1010 participants:
RR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49–0.85).477 Data on adverse effects, such
as weight loss and malnutrition, and on QoL were limited.
There is limited evidence on the use of very low–protein diets
in people with CKD and diabetes.23

Very low–protein diets are usually vegetarian or vegan diets
and may risk deﬁciencies of some essential amino acids. A
strategy to counteract this is the addition of supplements of
essential amino acids or precursors of essential amino acids (i.e.,
ketoacid analogs). By lacking the amino group, ketoacid analogs
serve as substrates for protein synthesis without the production
of toxic nitrogenous waste products. Limitations of ketoacid
analogs are, however, high pill burden and high cost. Fifteen
months of strict adherence to vegetarian very low–protein diets
of 0.3 g/kg body weight/d supplemented with 0.125 g/kg body
weight/d of ketoacids in people with an average eGFR of 18 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 at baseline slowed the decline in eGFR,
increased bicarbonate levels, and reduced the need for KRT
compared with a control group that ate a mixed-protein diet of
0.6 g/kg body weight/d.479 A recent pragmatic trial was not able
to reproduce this ﬁnding,480 potentially attributed by the
authors to challenges in patient compliance with the treatment.
There is concern that low-protein and very low–protein diets
may result in malnutrition. However, in the meta-analysis by
Hahn et al.,477 12 studies reported no evidence of malnutrition
in their study participants, whereas 3 studies reported small
in each arm with worsening
numbers of participants
nutritional status. The estimated average requirement
for
protein intake in adults is approximately 0.5–0.6 g/kg body
weight/d, which corresponds
to the amount of protein
required to avoid negative nitrogen balance.456 Thus under
correct supervision, these diets may not lead to malnutrition.
Malnutrition may arise if the reduction in protein is followed
by a reduction in energy intake. This may be preventable by
adequate patient education on food choices and close
supervision by
accredited nutrition
specialists. A patient-centered approach involves a shared
understanding of treatment goals, effective communication to
alleviate anxieties around food or food misconceptions,
individualized advice that matches cultural values and
preferences, and assistance with implementation of dietetic
advice in the face of a large symptom burden.

renal dietitians or

Some of the trials on low-protein diets were conducted
before treatment with RASi was introduced, and all of them
before the SGLT2i era. Because the mechanism of action of
these medications and that of low-protein and very low–
protein diets are complementary, it has been postulated that
these strategies may synergize and maximize their combined
effect on delaying CKD progression.475,481,482 Studies are
needed to demonstrate this hypothesis.

Low- or very low–protein diets are not indicated in people
who are metabolically unstable or during periods of metabolic
instability. This includes conditions that may exacerbate the
risk of malnutrition in the context of low-protein intake, such
as sarcopenia, cachexia, active inﬂammatory or infectious
diseases, periods of hospitalization or the early postoperative
period, poorly controlled diabetes, consumptive diseases such
as cancer,
treatment of antibiotic or immunosuppressive
medications, and signiﬁcant short-term loss of body weight.
Certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence was moder-
ate that there was little to no difference in the critical outcome of

all-cause death and kidney failure prevention when comparing
very low–protein to low- or normal-protein diets, and moderate
that there was some beneﬁt to the critical outcome of kidney
failure for the comparison of very low–protein diets with low- or
normal-protein diets as demonstrated by the wide CIs for these
outcomes including potential for important beneﬁts and harms.
In addition, there was important and unexplained heterogeneity
present. It is uncertain whether low- or very low–protein diets
impact a change in GFR.

The certainty of evidence was very low when comparing low-
protein to normal-protein diets for a change in GFR and low when
comparing very low–protein to low- or normal-protein diets. This
is because the CIs included potential for important beneﬁts and
harms. There was important and unexplained heterogeneity
present; the outcome was reported as a surrogate outcome; and
there was unclear allocation concealment in 4 studies.

The overall certainty of evidence for the remaining out-
comes was very low because of increased risk of bias and
small studies with wide CIs. In addition, many studies were
unclear about allocation concealment/random sequence
generation, and had signiﬁcant, unexplained heterogeneity,
wide CIs for important beneﬁts and harms, and use of sur-
rogate outcomes.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that some
clinically suitable people would choose to implement a diet
with protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d unless there are
conditions that contraindicate such as sarcopenia, cachexia,
or undernutrition. In addition, the Work Group judged that
protein restriction would be implemented by many people as
a way of managing their kidney disease. It will also have an
impact on overall QoL with the adoption of a more plant-
based diet; however, there may be challenges with imple-
menting and adhering to these changes.

Resource use and costs. The risks, beneﬁts, resource use,
and costs of dietary protein interventions should be consid-
ered when treating people with CKD. The Work Group
considered that plant-based proteins could have a cost-beneﬁt
effect compared with animal-based protein, but evidence in
this topic remains limited.

for

Considerations

implementation. Protein

restriction
without support and advice from renal dietitians or other
accredited nutrition providers may result in low dietary di-
versity and limited food choices, adversely impacting QoL
and altering fundamental components of a person’s culture
and daily life. The use of culturally appropriate foods that are
more familiar to people, nutritional status, goals of care, QoL,
and patient preferences should be considered in the imple-
mentation of these recommendations and practice points.

Rationale
The Work Group suggests dietary protein interventions based
on consideration of the possible beneﬁts of plant-based foods,
kidney protection, and avoidance of adverse effect of unsu-
pervised protein restriction. People with CKD not on dialysis
with or without diabetes may opt for some degree of dietary
protein moderation, especially as control of dietary intake

empowers people with CKD and supports self-care manage-
ment. People put a large value on diet, cultural preferences,
and QoL; however, adherence to a low-protein diet remains
challenging, may impact social and psychological well-being,
and given that most of the trials for protein restriction were
conducted before RASi and SGLT2i were implemented, may
not be worth the sacriﬁce/change in lifestyle. The impact of
protein restriction and the use of non–animal-based protein
diets should be evaluated in the context of new care para-
digms to ascertain the incremental gain of these strategies
relative to the efforts and costs.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake in
children with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment.
The target protein and energy intake in children with CKD
G2–G5 should be at the upper end of the normal range for
healthy children to promote optimal growth.

Children with CKD likely have similar resting energy
expenditure to healthy children and should have total energy
requirements in the normal range.483 As in adults, protein
restriction was considered for children with CKD in the past.
Two RCTs have compared low-protein versus normal-protein
diets in children with CKD.484,485 One found poorer growth
for those on a low-protein diet, and the other found no
difference in eGFR between the groups. A 2007 Cochrane
meta-analysis concluded that there was uncertainty over the
possible harm of strict low-protein diets on growth in young
infants.486 The 2009 KDOQI guidelines and the 2020 Pediatric
Renal Nutrition Taskforce suggest maintaining an intake of
dietary protein at 100%–140% of the dietary reference intake
(DRI) or the SDI for ideal body weight in children with CKD
G3 and at 100%–120% of the DRI/SDI in children with CKD
G4–G5.487,488

Older adults.

Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlying
conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higher
protein and calorie dietary targets.

In older adults with CKD, nutritional management should
consider potential challenges stemming from simultaneous
and potentially conﬂicting risks of CKD progression and
malnutrition/protein-energy wasting. In older adults, protein
targets should be set after careful individual assessment to
identify the most urgent clinical challenge.

Geriatric guidelines recommend protein intakes of 1.0–1.2 g/
kg body weight/d to prevent age-related malnutrition and pre-
vent sarcopenia.489 Such protein intakes may be appropriate in
some people with stable or slowly progressing CKD, whose
clinical picture is dominated by old age and related challenges
to their nutritional and functional status. On the other hand,
protein restriction may be appropriate in older adults whose
primary clinical challenge is CKD with signiﬁcant progression,
provided they are metabolically stable.490 The course of action
should consider patient preferences and when necessary,
involve family members and caregivers.

3.3.2 Sodium intake
The Work Group concurs with the following recommenda-
tion from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23 and the
the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical
Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.21

Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium
intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of
sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day)

substitutes)

Global average sodium intake is estimated to be 4310 mg/
d (10.78 g of salt per day), which far exceeds the physiological
requirement and is more than double the WHO recommenda-
tion of <2 g of sodium (equivalent to <5 g of salt) per day in
adults.491 This perhaps reﬂects the pervasive use of sodium in
many commercial
food products, which makes achieving
WHO targets challenging to meet for many people. There are
large-scale RCTs quantifying the beneﬁts of restricted salt
intake (e.g., using 75% sodium and 25% potassium chloride
salt
to lower BP and reduce the risk of
cardiovascular events in the general population.492 In RCTs
with up to 36 weeks of follow-up, reduction in dietary sodium
has also been shown to lower BP and levels of albuminuria in
people with CKD.492–494 Although presumed to reduce the risk
of CKD progression and CVD, longer term trials have not
been conducted to conﬁrm these effects translate into reduced
risk of clinical outcomes in CKD.493 Given the effects of
sodium restriction on BP,
it is reasonable to recommend
sodium restriction to people with CKD in combination with
pharmacological strategies to minimize the risk of kidney and
CVDs. People with CKD may have salt-wasting kidney disease,
malnutrition, or be exposed to extremely hot climatic
conditions. In such scenarios, this recommendation may not
apply.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based Recommended
Daily Intake when counseling about sodium intake for
children with CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood
pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height.

The WHO recommends that the maximum intake of <2 g/d
sodium (<5 g/d salt) in adults should be adjusted downward
based on the energy requirements of children relative to those
of adults (Table 22495). Children born with low birth weight
(<2.5 kg) are at increased risk for CKD in later life and may
also be at higher risk for hypertension and increased salt
sensitivity. Salt sensitivity is a physiological trait by which BP
in some people exhibits changes parallel to changes in salt
intake. Children born with low birth weight may have a 37%
increased salt sensitivity (deﬁned as an increase in mean BP

increase further in those who are small for gestational age.496
Children with CKD often have underlying tubular condi-
tions that predispose them to numerous electrolyte losses,
including sodium. For these children, a supplemented rather
than restricted sodium intake will be required. For non–salt-
wasting children, salt intake should be limited to the age-
based Recommended Daily Intake.

3.4 Blood pressure control

The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical
Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in
Chronic Kidney Disease, which encourages individualized BP
targets and use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, and
other comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and tolerance
to treatments.21 We highlight the following guidance:

Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults
with high BP and CKD be treated with a target
systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg,
when tolerated, using standardized ofﬁce BP
measurement (2B).

Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering
therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and frac-
tures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural
hypotension.

RCTs have not demonstrated that intensive BP-lowering
results in meaningful reductions in the risk of kidney failure,
but the RCT evidence supporting important cardiovascular
beneﬁts should encourage such a strategy. By aiming for an SBP
<120 mm Hg, more adults with CKD will achieve an SBP
<130 mm Hg, even if they do not meet the <120 mm Hg
target. Observationally, on average, each 20 mm Hg higher than
usual SBP and 10 mm Hg higher diastolic BP is associated with
an approximate doubling of cardiovascular risk, with no lower
limit down to at least 115/75 mm Hg.497 Data from the Systolic
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) support the SBP
target of <120 mm Hg (when measured using a standardized
ofﬁce BP measurement) to reduce cardiovascular risk in
adults aged >75 years, or aged >50 years with 1 or more of
the following risk factors: clinical or subclinical CVD (other
than stroke), eGFR 20–60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or$ 15% 10-
year cardiovascular risk.498 Compared with a target of 140
mm Hg, this approach reduces the risk of major adverse

cardiovascular events (MACE) by one-quarter (hazard ratio
[HR]: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64–0.89), and that relative beneﬁt was
similar in people with and without CKD. The SPRINT trial
excluded people with diabetes, but cardiovascular beneﬁts of
intensive BP lowering on risk of stroke and heart failure are
clearly apparent in people with diabetes in individual patient
level data meta-analysis of
intensive versus standard BP-
lowering trials.499

it

Standardized BP monitoring can be challenging to offer in a
clinic setting due to the time required500; however,
is
considered potentially hazardous to apply the recommended
SBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP measurements obtained in a
nonstandardized manner.500 A practical solution to ensure the
identiﬁcation of high BP is by using home-based monitoring
(or telemonitoring). Trials have shown that 2 morning and
evening BP measurements taken during the ﬁrst week of every
month can be used to titrate antihypertensive medication and
reduce BP more than “usual care” approaches.501

People who are frail, have limited life expectancy, or have a
history of falls and fractures may have increased risk of addi-
tional events if BP targets of <120 are achieved. Postural
hypotension in these people is associated with adverse out-
comes, and thus weighing the beneﬁts of some attenuation of
eGFR decline versus the life-changing impact of falls, fractures,
and other events should be considered in choosing speciﬁc
targets.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. The Work Group concurs with the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management
of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease, and we high-
light the following guidance21:

Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children
with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)
should be lowered to £50th percentile for age, sex,
and height (2C).

Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM
and every 3–6 months with standardized auscultatory ofﬁce
BP in children with CKD.

Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is
not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatory
ofﬁce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized
setting, of 50th–75th percentile for age, sex, and height
unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptoms
of hypotension.

These statements with respect to children are generally
worded to maintain consistency with the KDIGO 2021
Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood
Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease,21 where the full rationale
and evidence behind the statements are available. However,
the suggestion to target auscultatory ofﬁce SBP at the 50th–
75th percentile when ABPM is not available departs from

S212

www.kidney-international.org

c h a p t e r 3

the BP guideline (the previous guideline suggested a target
<90th percentile). Although ofﬁce BP may be higher than
BP measured by ABPM, this is not universally the case.
Given the evidence that intensive BP control may slow CKD
progression together with the very low risk of adverse
effects of intensive BP lowering in children,228 we consider
that more intensive BP lowering targeting around the 50th
percentile is reasonable. However, a target even lower than
the 50th percentile has not been shown to offer additional
beneﬁts. Recent trial data found that using a target of ofﬁce
auscultatory SBP at 50th to 75th percentile versus intensive
control

3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors

The Work Group highlights recommendations from the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management
of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease and selected
practice points for treatment with RASi from the KDIGO 2021
Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood
Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease21 and the KDIGO 2022
in
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management
Chronic Kidney Disease.23 The Work Group considers
several recommendations to apply even in the absence of
high BP and has adapted the recommendations from the BP
guideline to remove this requirement. Key recommendations
and practice points are highlighted:

Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting
renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angio-
tensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or
angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people
with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1–
G4, A3) without diabetes (1B).

Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEi
or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increased
albuminuria (G1–G4, A2) without diabetes (2C).

Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend starting
RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and
moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria
(G1–G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B).

Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding
any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin in-
hibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or
without diabetes (1B).

Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be
administered using the highest approved dose that is
tolerated to achieve the beneﬁts described because the
proven beneﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses.

Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine,
and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4
weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi,
depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.

Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use
of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the
serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose
or stopping RASi.

Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy
unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within
4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase
in dose.

Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or dis-
continuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symp-
tomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia
despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms
while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltra-
tion rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2).

Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD
with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi
(ACEi or ARB) for speciﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hyper-
tension or heart failure with low ejection fraction).

The role of RASi (speciﬁcally ACEi or ARB) in the manage-
ment of BP and people with CKD, diabetes, and/or high BP have
been speciﬁcally considered in recent KDIGO guidelines.21,23
Although temporarily stopping RASi may be a valid treatment
strategy for emergent hyperkalemia, we advise to ensure the
reinitiation of treatments once the adverse event is resolved, so
that people are not deprived of a needed medication (Practice
Point 4.3.3).502–506 The Work Group offers the new Practice
Point 3.6.6 and a revised algorithm for initiation of RASi
(Figure 21).23 The algorithm has been updated to suggest a
$30% decrease in eGFR (rather than increase in creatinine)
should be a trigger to investigate for an underlying other
condition. This represents a threshold above which the eGFR
change is greater than would be expected from natural
variation. Lastly, it should be noted that restricting salt intake
may help ensure maximal effects of RASi.

Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people
with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per
1.73 m2.

In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 participants with mean
eGFR of 13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a policy of discontinuing
RASi in CKD G4–G5 did not result in any kidney or car-
diovascular beneﬁts.507 Two observational studies have also
found that associations suggesting outcomes were worse
among participants who stopped RASi after reaching an

3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors
(SGLT2i)

The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical
in Chronic
Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management
Kidney Disease, which stated: “We recommend treating pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 with an SGLT2i (1A).”23 However, in this
guideline, we offer a more general 1A recommendation for
adults with CKD. We also highlight practice points from
the KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management in
CKD, which are also relevant for people with CKD without
diabetes:

Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an
eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with an SGLT2i (1A).

Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is
reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls
below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, unless it is not tolerated
or KRT is initiated.

Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating
adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following
(1A):
(cid:3) eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urine ACR ‡200

mg/g (‡20 mg/mmol), or

(cid:3) heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria.

Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not
necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and
the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally
not an indication to discontinue therapy.

Use of SGLT2i in people with T2D is recommended in previous
guidelines irrespective of level of albuminuria. This new recom-
mendation (3.7.2) places high value on the importance of reducing
risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure
in people with CKD and high value on the large relative reductions
in risk for kidney disease progression in a series of large, placebo-
controlled RCTs. It also places moderate value on the beneﬁts of
SGLT2i on risk of AKI, hospitalization for heart failure and
myocardial infarction, risk of hospitalization from any cause,
and high value on the demonstrable net absolute beneﬁts
versus absolute harms in people with CKD (particularly in those

without diabetes who are at very low risk of ketoacidosis). SGLT2i
also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, measures of ﬂuid over-
load, the risk of serious hyperkalemia, and do not increase risk of
hypoglycemia. The recommendation is consistent with but ex-
pands on Recommendation 1.3.1 from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical
Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kid-
ney Disease to include people with causes of CKD not related to
diabetes.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. Beneﬁts. Several large, pla-
cebo-controlled RCTs have provided clear demonstrations of
the efﬁcacy of SGLT2i, which substantially reduce the risk of
kidney failure, AKI, and hospitalization for heart failure, and
also moderately reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and
myocardial infarction in people with and without CKD. These
beneﬁts appear to be irrespective of diabetes status, cause of
kidney disease, or level of GFR.511,512 The beneﬁts of SGLT2i
in people with diabetes and CKD have been fully described in
the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes
Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.23

Two large RCTs using 2 different SGLT2i recruited 10,913
participants and focused on CKD populations at risk of
progression, reporting beneﬁts in terms of kidney disease

progression.403,513 Key differences between the 2 trials were

compared with

In a collaborative metanalysis including those 2 and 11
other trials (13 trials with just over 90,000 randomized par-
ticipants) in comparison with placebo, those allocated to an
SGLT2i experienced a 37% reduction in the risk of kidney
disease progression and a 23% reduction in the risk of AKI
irrespective of diabetes status (Figure 22).511

The same meta-analysis showed that, compared with pla-
cebo, allocation to an SGLT2i reduced the risk of the com-
posite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart
failure by 23% irrespective of diabetes status (Figure 23511),
although there were limited numbers of cardiovascular
events in people with CKD without diabetes. SGLT2i also
afford an approximate 10% RR reduction in MACE,
primarily from reduced risk of cardiovascular death and
myocardial infarction with no clear effect on stroke.511,512

Furthermore, SGLT2i also importantly reduce the risk of
hospitalization from any cause,403 reduce BP,403,513,514 uric

Harms. SGLT2i are well

tolerated with high levels of
adherence in the RCTs in CKD.403,513,514 In the studied
populations,
lower-limb
amputation resulting from SGLT2i use was substantially
lower than the potential absolute beneﬁts and generally
restricted to people with diabetes. Meta-analysis estimates of
absolute beneﬁts and harms for each 1000 people with
CKD and T2D treated for 1 year with an SGLT2i were 11
fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heart
for approximately 1 episode of ketoacidosis and
failure,
approximately 1 lower-limb amputation, respectively (and
also 11 fewer people developing kidney disease progression
and 4 fewer people with AKI). The corresponding beneﬁts
in people with CKD without diabetes were 15 fewer people
with kidney disease progression, 5 fewer with AKI, and 2
fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heart
failure per 1000 patient-years of treatment with no excess
risk of ketoacidosis or amputation observed.511 The vast
majority of urinary tract infections in people taking SGLT2i

are not caused by SGLT2 inhibition, and there is no
increased risk of hypoglycemia. There is an increased risk of
mycotic genital infections (in men and women), but these
are generally mild and treating these infections with low-
cost topical agents should help treatment adherence.

Certainty of evidence. SGLT2i have been studied in a
series of large trials with consistent effects observed be-
tween trials, using different agents in the class. The trials
have robust double-blind designs that minimize risk of
bias, and they have provided precise estimates of effect
with no risk of publication bias due to the Nufﬁeld
Department of Public Health (NDPH) Renal Studies
Group and SGLT2 inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal
Trialists’ Consortium (SMART)
collaboration, which
brought together all the trialists that have conducted the
relevant large trials. The totality of the evidence provides
high levels of certainty of efﬁcacy, with larger effect sizes
observed in many populations. Relative effects on kidney
disease progression appeared to be larger among people
with higher levels of albuminuria who are at highest ab-
solute risk of progression. The size of RR reductions

for CKD progression was graded as high (no concerns
regarding the risk of bias of the studies or the consistency,
directness, and precision of the results). The certainty of the
evidence for the kidney failure outcome in people with
CKD without diabetes was downgraded to moderate due to
imprecision (although clear beneﬁts are demonstrated in
the CKD trials: Figure 24518). Neither RCT reported on the
critical outcome of hospitalizations for any cause in the
subgroup without diabetes.

Rationale
Large trials individually and when combined in meta-analysis
demonstrate clear net beneﬁts of SGLT2i, with net beneﬁts
particularly large in people without diabetes due to almost no
risk of serious harm from ketoacidosis or lower-limb ampu-
tation.

Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults
with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urine
ACR <200 mg/g (<20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i
(2B).

This recommendation places high value on the potential for long-
term use of SGLT2i in people without diabetes who have a sub-
stantially decreased GFR to reduce the risk of kidney failure but
recognizes remaining uncertainty in this population due to the
short follow-up in the RCTs. It also places moderate value on the
beneﬁts of SGLT2i on risk of AKI, cardiovascular death and
myocardial infarction, and risk of hospitalization from any cause.
SGLT2i also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, ﬂuid overload,
and the risk of serious hyperkalemia. Note that a person with CKD
and heart failure has a clear indication for the use of SGLT2i to
reduce risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart
failure irrespective of level of albuminuria (Figure 24).

Key information

Beneﬁts and harms. Several large placebo-controlled RCTs
have provided clear demonstrations of the efﬁcacy of SGLT2i,
which substantially reduce the risk of kidney disease progression
and kidney failure (Figures 22 and 24) as well as moderately
reduce the risk of CVD events (Figure 23) in people with and
without CKD. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the kidney
disease progression outcome subdivided by primary kidney
diagnosis demonstrated that there was no signiﬁcant subgroup
interaction by primary kidney diagnosis, and SGLT2i reduced
the risk of AKI by 23% in people with or without diabetes
(Figure 22).511 SGLT2i also reduce the risk of hospitalization
for any cause in people with CKD.403,520 Some uncertainty
remains about the effects on kidney disease progression in
people without diabetes with urine ACR <200 mg/g (<20 mg/
mmol), which
the
a
recommendation for that population. EMPA-KIDNEY was the
key trial to assess effects in people with CKD at risk of
progression with urine ACR <200 mg/g (<20 mg/mmol) and
found evidence of signiﬁcant interaction by ACR status for its
primary outcome (trend P ¼ 0.02). Relative effects appeared to
be larger in people with higher levels of albuminuria. The slow
rate of progression and small number of outcomes in the A1
subgroup limited the power for EMPA-KIDNEY to assess
effects on the primary outcome in this subgroup. There were,

follow-up in the A2 and A3 groups were considered separately
(Figure 25403).

Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of evidence for
the efﬁcacy of SGLT2i to delay CKD progression in people with
CKD without diabetes is moderate (see Supplementary Table
S1023,403,511,518,521–524). The ERT identiﬁed an individual
participant data (IPD) meta-analysis,511 which included data
from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor among adults
with CKD but not diabetes.403,513 Both RCTs were considered
to have a low risk of bias. The IPD meta-analysis harmonized
the deﬁnition of CKD progression among the trials. The
certainty of the evidence for CKD progression was graded as
high as there were no concerns regarding the risk of bias of
the studies or the consistency, directness, and precision of the
results. The certainty of the evidence for kidney failure was
downgraded to moderate due to imprecision.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that fully
informed adults without diabetes and low levels of albuminuria
(urine ACR <200 mg/g [<20 mg/mmol]) who have established
CKD and an eGFR of 20–45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may be
particularly motivated to take SGLT2i for the beneﬁts identiﬁed
on rate of decline in GFR as they already have substantially
reduced GFR. Adults with established CKD are highly likely to
want to start treatment early to maximize beneﬁts. Extrapola-
tion of the ﬁndings from eGFR slope analyses (Figure 25) could
mean substantial delays in any future requirement for KRT.
People with CKD may also be motivated by the potential for
SGLT2i
serious
to reduce risk of AKI, hospitalization,
hyperkalemia, ﬂuid overload, and uric acid levels, all of which
are common CKD complications.

Resource use and costs. Health economic analyses are
required in people with CKD without diabetes and low levels
of albuminuria to establish their level of cost-effectiveness.
From a healthcare system perspective, reducing the cost
burden of hospitalizations and dialysis is highly desirable, and
QoL may be preserved longer from their avoidance. Speciﬁcs
as to whether people bear the costs of these medications will
be country-dependent.

Considerations for implementation.. The considerations for
implementation in people with CKD and low levels of albu-
minuria are no different to people with albuminuria (see
above for details).

Rationale
Large trials considered individually and combined in meta-
analysis demonstrate clear net beneﬁts of SGLT2i, but ev-
idence for beneﬁts on CKD progression in people without
diabetes and with low levels of albuminuria is limited to
eGFR slope analyses in heart failure trials and one CKD
trial all with relatively short follow-up periods. However,
these eGFR slope results suggests that
extrapolation of
important beneﬁts would accrue for such people if treated
long term.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. SGLT2i have not been tested in
clinical
trials on children with kidney disease. Limited
observational data and phase II trial data exist for children
with and without kidney disease. Four studies (99 children
and young adults with diabetes and normal GFR) found that
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were likely to be
the same in children and adults.525–528 Recent work modeled
pediatric dapagliﬂozin dosing for smaller children based on
known pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.483 Side
effects reported from the prior studies included an increase
in glycosuria and infrequent reporting of nausea, genital
infection, dehydration, and abdominal pain. In an RCT,
there were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and similar

There is limited research on kidney effects of SGLT2i in
children. One study of 8 children with CKD and proteinuria
found a reduction in 24-hour urine protein from a mean of 2.1
g/d to a mean of 1.5 g/d over 12 weeks.530 Theoretically, the
glycosuric effect of SGLT2i may lead to a negative calorie
balance, interfering with optimal growth, especially in small
children with underlying growth retardation. Clinical trials in
the pediatric population are suggested, including in those
with speciﬁc etiologies and at different age groups (i.e.,
prepubescent, peripubescent, and postpubescent).

DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD). The Work Group considers
these potassium thresholds to be conservative, and it may be considered appropriate to continue MRAs in people with potassium of 5.5–6.0 mmol/
l. This algorithm could be used for steroidal MRA. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved initiation of Kþ < 5.0 mmol/l. This
ﬁgure is guided by trial design and the FDA label and may be different in other countries. Serum creatinine/estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR) should be monitored concurrently with serum potassium. Reproduced from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Diabetes Work
Group. KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease. Kidney Int. 2022;102:S1–S127.23

Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven
kidney or cardiovascular beneﬁt for adults with T2D,
an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, normal serum
potassium concentration, and albuminuria (>30 mg/
g [>3 mg/mmol]) despite maximum tolerated dose
of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A).

Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most
appropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk of
CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as
demonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other
standard-of-care therapies.

Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added
to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD
in adults.

Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyper-
kalemia, select people with consistently normal serum
potassium concentration and monitor serum potassium
regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA
(Figure 26).

Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA
should prioritize agents with documented kidney or
cardiovascular beneﬁts.

Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for
treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or re-
fractory hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or a
reversible decline in glomerular ﬁltration, particularly
among people with a low GFR.

reduced
cardiovascular risk in people with CKD and T2D (HR: 0.86;
95% CI: 0.78–0.95). The beneﬁt was in large part due to a
22% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure
(HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66–0.92), with no clear effect on stroke
(Figure 27).535 These trials have some limitations on their
generalizability to all people with CKD at risk of progression,
given that study participants had an eGFR of $25 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 and an ACR of $30 mg/g ($3 mg/mmol), and
that people without diabetes were excluded.

Whether based on laboratory data or investigator reports,
ﬁnerenone approximately doubled the RR of hyperkalemia
compared with controls. However, risks were generally low
and average increase in serum potassium was approximately
0.2–0.3 mEq from baseline values. The low absolute baseline
risk of hyperkalemia may be due to the selection of partic-
ipants with serum potassium <4.8 mmol/l and careful
algorithmic monitoring of potassium during follow-up.
Speciﬁc analyses of FIDELIO-DKD reported that 2.3% and
11.0% of participants in the ﬁnerenone group withdrew or
interrupted treatment due to hyperkalemia (deﬁned as
serum potassium >5.5 mmol/l),
versus
0.9% and 5.2% for the placebo group.535 Overall,
in
FIDELITY,
for
hyperkalemia was 1.7% versus 0.6%. Hospitalization for
serious hyperkalemia was relatively rare with a <1% excess
risk over 3 years.536 Finerenone was also otherwise
generally well-tolerated with no excess risk for serious AKI
identiﬁed in the 2 large trials. Further details are available

3.9 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1 RA)

The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice
point from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.23

Recommendation 3.9.1: In adults with T2D and CKD
who have not achieved individualized glycemic
targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2 inhib-
itor treatment, or who are unable to use those
medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA
(1B).

Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should
prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular
beneﬁts.

Results of the FLOW trial assessing effects of GLP-1 RA in
a dedicated CKD population are awaited. It is a deﬁnitive
assessment of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in 3534
people with CKD, albuminuria, and T2D.537a Nevertheless,
extrapolating current evidence from trials in people with
T2D where kidney
generally preserved
function was
suggests GLP-1 RA safely improve glycemic control and
may reduce weight and risk of CVD in people with
CKD.23,538 Meta-analysis of these large, placebo-controlled
cardiovascular outcome GLP-1 RA trials has shown reduced
MACE in people with prior CVD or at high risk.538 The
size of RR reductions on cardiovascular risk appears similar
in people with or without decreased GFR.538 Once
aggregated, GLP-1 RAs were shown to have modestly
reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.89;
95% CI: 0.82–0.92) and separately reduced risk of death
from any cause (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82–0.94).538 The
KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes
Management in Chronic Kidney Disease has recommended
that long-acting GLP-1 RAs are prioritized ahead of insulin
in people with T2D and CKD. GLP-1 RAs with proven

3.10 Metabolic acidosis

chronic metabolic

As GFR decreases, the kidney’s ability to excrete hydrogen
ions and generate bicarbonate decreases, resulting in the
development of
acidosis. Metabolic
acidosis is observationally associated with increased risk of
protein catabolism, muscle wasting, inﬂammation, and other
complications such as impaired cardiac function and mor-
tality that are also associated with decreased eGFR.539,540 The
causality of such associations remains to be demonstrated.

Deﬁnition and prevalence. Serum bicarbonate concentration
begins to fall progressively once eGFR falls below 60 ml/min

per 1.73 m2 with reductions most evident in CKD stages G4–
G5 (Figure 28,541 Table 23). The adjusted adult prevalence of
serum bicarbonate <22 mmol/l was 7.7% and 6.7% in those
with and without diabetes at stage G3, A1, respectively,
increasing to 38.3% and 35.9% by CKD stage G5, A3.

Practice Point 3.10.1: In people with CKD, consider use of
pharmacological treatment with or without dietary inter-
vention to prevent development of acidosis with potential
clinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/l
in adults).

Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic
acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate
concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and
does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or
ﬂuid status.

The Work Group has not provided a graded recommen-
dation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale
RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was
justiﬁed because alkali supplementation may be a promising
low-cost, high-beneﬁt adjunct treatment for people with CKD
and may be accessible to all populations. This was based on an
RCT that had suggested potential kidney disease progression
and nutritional beneﬁts with no important increase in BP or
heart failure complications.1 However, since 2012, a number
of
trials testing the hypothesis that sodium bicarbonate
therapy would slow kidney disease progression have been
reported,
including several employing placebo control. A
2021 systematic review identiﬁed 15 trials with $3 months
of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral
sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no study
medication on kidney outcomes. Of the 15 trials (2445
participants, median follow-up 12 months), 11 were
published since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains
limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analysis
restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not conﬁrm
any important modifying effect of oral sodium bicarbonate
versus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:
0.54–1.22).542 The largest placebo-controlled trial of oral
sodium bicarbonate was conducted by the Clinical and
cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for

versus 33 of 148 kidney failure outcomes to the meta-
analysis in its bicarbonate versus placebo arms, respectively
(HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.64–1.49). Importantly, the BiCARB
trial, which studied people with CKD G3–G4 aged $60
years and sodium bicarbonate concentration <22 mmol/l,
also found no evidence of beneﬁt on nonkidney outcomes
to support oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation (the
primary outcome was based on the Short Physical

included generic and disease-speciﬁc QoL assessments,

Pediatric considerations. As in adults, children with CKD
often have metabolic acidosis. In the CKiD and the Cardio-
vascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease
Study (4C) studies, 38%–60% of children had a serum bicar-
bonate of <22 mmol/l, varying by CKD category. Low bicar-
bonate was associated with increased risk of disease
progression.395,552 It should also be noted that for younger
children, the normal range for sodium bicarbonate is as low
as 17 mmol/l. In children, metabolic acidosis is also likely to
cause growth retardation. Data from the observational CKiD
study revealed that prepubertal children with acidosis who
were treated with alkali had improved growth.553 In children

3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD

Deﬁnition and prevalence. Potassium is key to cell mem-
brane electrophysiology, with abnormalities predisposing to
abnormal cardiac conduction and arrhythmias. The kidneys
play a key role in potassium homeostasis with decreased GFR
generally associated with increased potassium concentration
(Table 24; Figure 29555). The deﬁnition of hyperkalemia is
based on the distribution of potassium values in the general
population. Hyperkalemia is uncommon when the eGFR is
>60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and increases with lower GFR.

Adults with CKD G3, A1 in the general and high-risk pop-
ulation cohorts, contributing to the CKD-PC, had an adjusted
prevalence of hyperkalemia (deﬁned as a serum potassium
>5.0 mmol/l) of 8.8% and 4.5% in those with and without
diabetes, respectively, increasing to 34.4% and 23.7% by CKD
G5, A3 (Figure 30).541 Note that there is variability in the
prevalence of hyperkalemia, and it is not inevitable at lower

levels of GFR, thus understanding potassium physiology and its
impacting factors are important in effective patient care.

Hyperkalemia in people with preserved GFR is less prev-
alent. An acute episode of hyperkalemia is a potassium result
above the upper limit of normal that is not known to be
chronic. At the current time, there is no consensus on the
magnitude, duration, and frequency of elevated potassium
values that deﬁne chronicity.556 In addition to decreased
eGFR, other risk factors for hyperkalemia included higher

constipation,
ACR and prior diabetes, hyperglycemia,
RASi,557 and MRA.536 Note that SGLT2i do not appear to
increase serum potassium values.403,517

Studies have demonstrated a continuous U-shaped rela-
tionship between serum potassium and all-cause mortality
in a range of different populations (Figure 31).555,558 It has
also been associated with worse kidney prognosis.559
Observationally, the risk of death from the same degree of
hyperkalemia is lower in more advanced CKD stages.560–564
This may suggest that there are adaptive mechanisms that
render better tolerance to elevated levels of potassium in
circulation.561,565–568

3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium
measurement
There are several factors and mechanisms that may impact on
potassium measurements, including the actions of medications
that can increase the risk of developing hyperkalemia. These are
summarized in Tables 25556,569–575 and 26.23,576

Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of po-
tassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and
mechanisms that may inﬂuence potassium measurement
including diurnal and seasonal variation, plasma versus
serum samples, and the actions of medications.

The Work Group would like to highlight Figure 26 for the
monitoring of serum potassium during treatment with a
nonsteroidal MRA (ﬁnerenone) from the KDIGO 2022
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management
in
Chronic Kidney Disease.23

Hyperkalemia has been associated with therapeutic actions
of either reducing or stopping RASi.577–580 Steps can be taken
to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia and improve potassium
control that could increase the use of RASi in people with an
evidenced indication. For details on how to manage hyper-
kalemia associated with the use of RASi and associated

3.11.2 Potassium exchange agents

Practice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or
formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologic
management of nonemergent hyperkalemia.

The pharmacologic management of nonemergent hyper-
kalemia has a number of clinical tools with the increased
number of licensed potassium exchange agents. These med-
ications have differing mechanisms of action, onsets of clin-
ical effects, and potential medication and disease-state
interactions (Table 27581,582). Although the classic potassium
exchange agents have had tolerability issues, the newer ones
appear to have fewer such issues and appear relatively safe
when used long term.575,583,584 Use of these newer exchange
agents may help facilitate essential use of RASi/MRA.
However,
it is important that the healthcare provider be
aware of clinical nuances and local availability or formulary
selection.583 A

3.11.4 Managing hyperkalemia
In people with CKD and the management of nonemergent
hyperkalemia, a systematic approach of treating correctable
factors (e.g., correction of severe metabolic acidosis) and
understanding the role of diet and medications may provide
a pragmatic framework. Figure 32 shows a stepwise
practical approach to the management of hyperkalemia in
CKD.

3.11.5 Dietary considerations
In early stages of CKD, high intake of foods naturally rich in
potassium appears to be protective against disease progres-
sion, and dietary restriction of foods naturally containing

cardiac health; therefore, such restriction is not endorsed.587

3.11.3 Timing to recheck potassium after identifying moder-
ate and severe hyperkalemia in adults
“Think Kidneys” and the UK Kidney Association have pro-
vided a practical guide, which we have adapted (Table 28) for
repeat testing after a hyperkalemic episode.585 The timing of
repeat testing is guided by the level of hyperkalemia and the
clinical context.586

Practice Point 3.11.5.2: Provide advice to limit the intake of
foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods)
for people with CKD G3–G5 who have a history of
hyperkalemia or as a prevention strategy during disease
periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

Special considerations

International considerations. For people with CKD and
severe recurrent hyperkalemia (potassium >6 mmol/l), the
balance to be considered is between the additional cost of
the number needed to treat with potassium exchange agents
to prevent additional costs of hyperkalemia over and above
CKD management costs. If the price for potassium-lowering
therapy is
inpatient and
outpatient costs due to prevented hyperkalemia, the cost-
beneﬁt ratio will be favorable because in addition to the
health beneﬁts, there is a net saving of healthcare costs
resulting from potassium-lowering treatment. The key is to
implement a successful affordable strategy for hyperkalemia
management that allows the maintenance of other therapies

directed at reducing both progression of CKD and reduction
in MACE.

Pediatric considerations. As described for adults with CKD,
abnormal serum potassium levels are also commonly seen in
children with advanced stages of CKD, as well as those with
glomerular disorders, metabolic acidosis, and those on
RASi.600 In addition, a small group of children with CKD can
have persistent hypokalemia, usually as a result of inherited or
acquired renal tubular disorders.

In children with CKD, discontinuation of RASi was asso-
ciated with an acceleration of kidney function decline
compared with a matched control cohort of children in
whom RASi were continued.395

In children with CKD, the dietary management of potas-
sium can pose unique challenges as the provision of adequate
energy, protein, and micronutrients for growth cannot be
compromised, and specialized low potassium nutritional
formulas may not be widely available or palatable.601

extraskeletal (i.e., vascular) calciﬁcation related to these
abnormalities of metabolism. It has been recommended
that in people with CKD G3a–G5, treatments of CKD-MBD
should be based on serial assessments of phosphate,
calcium, and PTH levels considered together.20

Higher serum phosphate concentrations are associated with
mortality,602 and experimental data suggest that serum phosphate
concentration is directly related to bone disease, vascular
calciﬁcation,603,604 and CVD. Low-phosphorus diets and
binders are used to help lower serum phosphate to reduce the
long-term complications of CKD-MBD,
although more
research is needed to fully understand the disease-modifying
impact of these interventions.605 Similarly, despite evidence
suggesting no beneﬁt on clinical outcomes,606 vitamin D
replacement and calcimimetics to control PTH levels and to
maintain calcium within the normal range are also common
strategies. For recommendations regarding selection and dosing
with speciﬁc therapeutic agents and research, please see the
KDIGO 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the
Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention, and Treatment of Chronic
Kidney Disease–Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD).20

3.14 Hyperuricemia

Deﬁnition and prevalence. Uric acid is the end product of the
metabolism of purine compounds, and both increased urate
production and decreased kidney excretion of uric acid can lead
to hyperuricemia. The American College of Rheumatology
deﬁnes hyperuricemia as a serum uric acid concentration of
$6.8 mg/dl (approximately $400 mmol/l).607

Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) 2015–2016 found that the crude
adult prevalence of gout (deﬁned as self-reported, doctor
diagnosis, or uric acid–lowering therapy use) was 3.9% with a
higher prevalence in men than women (5.2% vs. 2.7%). After
adjustment for age and sex, an eGFR consistent with CKD G3
was associated with about twice the prevalence of gout (odds
ratio: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.05–3.66).608

Recommendation 3.14.1: We recommend people
with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be
offered uric acid–lowering intervention (1C).

The Work Group placed high value on avoiding the un-
pleasant symptoms of acute gout and preventing long-term
complications of recurrent gout among people with CKD.
There are well-tolerated and low-cost oral medications that
can effectively lower blood uric acid concentration in people
with CKD.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. Systematic review of the
management of gout by the American College of Rheu-
matology found strong evidence for uric acid lowering in
people with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to
gout, or frequent gout ﬂares; some of whom also had
CKD.607

The ERT assessed the safety of uric acid–lowering therapy
and found that uric acid lowering did not increase adverse
events among people with CKD and particularly focused on
risk of cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivity (pooled RR:
1.00; 95% CI: 0.60–1.65) and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR:
0.92; 95% CI: 0.37–2.30). Uric acid–lowering therapy was also
found not to modify the risk of cardiovascular events or all-
cause mortality in people with CKD.150,609,610 This reassuring
safety proﬁle is consistent with general
cardiovascular
population data.

The overall certainty of the evidence for delaying pro-

outcomes, such as cutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity, and
hepatotoxicity, was graded as low. However, the certainty of
evidence for uric acid–lowering interventions in reducing
frequency and severity of gout attack, and limiting tophaceous
deposition is consistently high, so the recommendation is
given an overall grade of level C.

Values and preferences. People with gout have reported
that they were initially hesitant to start uric acid–lowering
therapy, but that after experiencing improved control of
inﬂammatory symptoms and tophi, they became strong
advocates for its earlier institution.607

Rationale
Uric acid–lowering therapy reduces uric acid levels and their
associated symptomatic joint and skin complications, and are
generally safe to use.

Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid–lowering
therapy for people with CKD after their ﬁrst episode of gout
(particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum
uric acid concentration is >9 mg/dl [535 mmol/l]).

Although the initiation of uric acid–lowering therapy in
people with a ﬁrst gouty arthritis episode and no tophi was
not recommended by the American College of Rheumatology,
uric acid–lowering therapy use was suggested to be initiated
in people with CKD G3–G5, serum uric acid concentration
>9 mg/dl (>535 mmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of their
ﬁrst episode of gout. This was justiﬁed by the higher risk of
gout progression and development of clinical
in
CKD.607 The ERT evidence review identiﬁed that uric acid–
lowering therapy results in an increased risk of a gout ﬂare
during the ﬁrst 3 months after initiation in people with
CKD. This is an expected short-term risk of uric acid
lowering that people should be counseled about when
initiating such therapy. Two relatively small randomized

Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute
gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral
glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inﬂam-
matory drugs (NSAIDs).

The American College of Rheumatology recommended that
colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids are preferred ﬁrst-line
therapies for acute gout treatment based on demonstrated high
levels of evidence for efﬁcacy,
low cost, and tolerability.607
Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For
colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved dosing (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an
hour later, with ongoing anti-inﬂammatory therapy until the
ﬂare resolves) was highlighted.607 Dose adjustment should be
considered for CKD G5. Anti-inﬂammatory treatment may be
useful as prophylaxis against a symptomatic ﬂare when
initiating uric acid–lowering therapy and may sometimes be
required long term (without diarrhea). We have advised that
low-dose colchicine is preferable to NSAIDs given the safety
and tolerability proﬁle
risk of
and may
cardiovascular events.626 In contrast, NSAIDs can cause toxicity
in CKD and need to be used cautiously.627 Short courses of
glucocorticoids titrated to symptoms response (e.g., 30 mg
prednisolone orally for 3–5 days) could be used as an alternative.

also reduce

Dietary approaches.

Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventions
which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol,
meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake.

High alcohol intake, high purine intake, and consumption
of carbonated drinks are associated with higher levels of
serum uric acid. Consumption of these products in higher
amounts is associated with both higher levels and gout
symptoms. In contrast, diets that are low in fat and dairy, and
high ﬁber, plant-based diets are associated with lower inci-
dence of gout. Thus, diet modiﬁcation may be of value in
people with CKD, high uric acid, and gout.

Serum uric acid levels among people with a history of gout
are higher in those with higher versus moderate levels of
alcohol intake ($30 units/wk vs. <20 units/wk), as is the risk
of recurrence.624,628 The odds of gout also appear higher
among those with higher median purine intake ($850 mg
vs. <850 mg estimated purine intake in the last 24 hours).624
Experimentally, 2 hours after ingestion of 1 g/kg of body
weight of fructose, serum uric acid concentration increases
by 1–2 mg/dl (59.5–119 mmol/l),629 and its consumption in
carbonated drinks is observationally associated with higher
serum uric acid concentration levels,630,631 and incident gout
(whereas diet versions of these drinks are not).632 Foods
associated with a low incidence of gout include low-fat dairy,
and high-ﬁber and plant-based diets.633

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. There are no uric acid–lowering

trials in children.

International considerations. Asian (as opposed to African
and Caucasian) ethnicities may be at higher risk of serious

skin cutaneous reactions if they carry the HLA-B*5801 allele.
It has been suggested that HLA-B*5801 allele screening may
be considered in people who will be treated with allopurinol
(although there is uncertainty that screening would be cost-
effective).634

Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using
agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD
and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD
progression (2D).

The Work Group judged that most well-informed people with
CKD would prefer to optimize medical therapies that have
proven beneﬁt for CKD progression, and that the evidence does
not support treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to modify
risk of CKD progression.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. On balance, despite obser-
vational studies implicating elevated serum uric acid levels in
the progression of CKD, the data from systematic reviews and
multiple RCTs do not support treatment in the absence of
symptoms. Given the pill burden and lack of data, there is
for the use of uric acid–lowering agents.
little support
Observational data that implicate elevated serum uric acid
levels in the progression of CKD have not been shown to
reﬂect causal associations,635,636 as RCTs evaluating uric acid
lowering on progression of CKD do not demonstrate clear
beneﬁt on progression,
including data summarized in a
Cochrane systematic review comprising 12 RCTs that had
randomized 1187 participants.609 Since the 2017 Cochrane
review, 3 large, important RCTs with negative results have
been conducted in people with CKD and asymptomatic
hyperuricemia (Table 30).615,616,637

The ERT review identiﬁed 25 studies (26 publications) that
compared a uric acid–lowering therapy with placebo, usual
care, or another uric acid–lowering therapy among people with
CKD and hyperuricemia.150,612–619,622,637–652 Twenty-two
studies (23 publications)150,612–619,622,637–652 were new studies
published since the Cochrane review or were not captured by
the Cochrane 2017 review.609 We did not include 9 studies
from the Sampson et al.609 review because they did not
include a separate analysis among people with CKD or
because the study was reported as a meeting abstract only.
Among people with CKD and hyperuricemia, the effects of
uric acid–lowering therapy compared with placebo or usual
care were unclear in terms of progression of kidney failure
(pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.43–1.98 for studies ranged in
follow-up from 3 months to 7 years), cutaneous reactions
and hypersensitivity (pooled RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.60–1.65),
and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.37–2.30).
Lastly, within the various therapies among people with CKD
and hyperuricemia, the effects of febuxostat compared with
benzbromarone on cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivity
were unclear (RR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.01–4.01).

certainty of

Certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of the evi-
dence for uric acid–lowering therapy among people with CKD
and hyperuricemia is very low. The critical outcome of delaying
the progression of CKD was addressed by 7 RCTs.150,612,615–619
The
evidence was downgraded for
inconsistency because there was some statistical heterogeneity
detected in our meta-analysis (Supplementary Table S12
615–619,637,638,640,642,651,653). The certainty of the evidence was
further downgraded because of very serious imprecision, as
there were few events in the trials.

the

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that most
well-informed people with CKD would prefer to optimize
medical therapies that have proven beneﬁt for CKD pro-
gression, and that there is little evidence to support the
treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to modify the risk
of CKD progression.

Resource use and costs. There are no cost considerations,
beyond cost-savings, in our recommendation not to use uric
acid–lowering agents.

Considerations for implementation. There are no imple-
mentation considerations in our recommendation not to use
uric acid–lowering agents.

Rationale
There is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend the use of uric
acid–lowering therapies in asymptomatic hyperuricemia for
the speciﬁc purpose of delaying CKD progression. We make
the recommendation not giving uric acid–lowering therapy in
asymptomatic hyperuricemia for slowing of kidney disease
based on the current evidence that suggests unclear beneﬁts.
We judge that it is best practice not to expose people to
medications that provide little beneﬁt.

3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional
speciﬁc interventions to modify risk

Prevalence and diagnosis. People with CKD are at increased
risk of CVD,654,655 a key feature of which is structural heart
disease, heart failure, and sudden death.656–658 Increased risk
of atherosclerotic disease also accompanies CKD.654 These
risks increase progressively as eGFR declines (Figure 3612).4
Risk of death from CVD exceeds the risk of progression to
kidney failure for the majority of people with CKD.

The diagnosis of cardiac disease can be more complex and
challenging in CKD, with many standard tests needing careful

electrocardiography may be limited through inability to
exercise to a diagnostic workload, or presence of microvascular

diagnostic imaging, thus impacting treatment choices; the risks
of contrast agents may limit the use of imaging. In addition, a

ischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic changes than in

3.15.1 Lipid management
Dyslipidemia in CKD is frequently characterized by high tri-
glycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and an increased proportion
of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are small and
oxidized.665 In adults with newly identiﬁed CKD, it has been
recommended to evaluate their lipid proﬁle (total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), but

are

recommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out
in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline
for Lipid
in Chronic Kidney Disease.19 The Work
Management
Group concurs with all
in this
guideline. In particular, we draw attention to:

the recommendations

Recommendation 3.15.1.1: In adults aged ‡50 years
with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 but not treated
with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR
categories G3a–G5), we recommend treatment with
a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A).

Recommendation 3.15.1.2: In adults aged ‡50 years
with CKD and eGFR ‡60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (GFR
categories G1–G2), we recommend treatment with a
statin (1B).

Recommendation 3.15.1.3: In adults aged 18–49 years
with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kid-
ney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in
people with one or more of the following (2A):
(cid:3) known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or

coronary revascularization),

(cid:3) diabetes mellitus,
(cid:3) prior ischemic stroke, or
(cid:3) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or

nonfatal myocardial infarction >10%.

The Work Group offers the following practice points to

support implementation of the recommendations above.

Practice Point 3.15.1.1 Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk
using a validated risk tool.

Details of the Work Group recommendations on how to
estimate risk are provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.3. Currently,

Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin-
based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largest
treatment beneﬁts.

Since 2013, published literature has continued to demon-
strate the general safety of statin-based therapies.667 This
includes individual participant-level data meta-analysis by the
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ collaboration, showing that
statin therapy causes only a small excess of mild muscle pain,
and most (>90%) of all reports of muscle symptoms among
users are not due to their statins.668 In CKD, the Study of
Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) demonstrated that an
intensive statin-based regimen was safe and not associated
with any serious nonvascular hazard.669,670 A Cholesterol
Treatment Trialists’ collaboration meta-analysis combining
SHARP with the other large trials took into account the
smaller reductions in LDL cholesterol achieved with statin-
in people with CKD G3–G5. After

difference,
the RR reductions in major vascular events
observed with statin-based treatment in the large statin trials
were shown to become progressively smaller as eGFR
declines, with little evidence of beneﬁt in people on dialysis
(Figure 37).671 The corollary of this observation is that in
people with CKD, statin-based regimens should be chosen to
maximize the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol
to
achieve the largest treatment beneﬁts. Large trials have shown
the following once-daily intensive statin-based regimens are
safe in CKD (including people on dialysis): atorvastatin

recommendations. There is good evidence for the safety of
intensive LDL-cholesterol lowering, and statin-based therapy
combined with a ﬁre-and-forget strategy is low cost. This
approach is consistent with a more recent recommendation
for primary prevention in CKD by the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (which recom-
mended 10-year thresholds of >7.5%).674

Practice Point 3.15.1.4: Consider prescribing proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors to
people with CKD who have an indication for their use.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) in-
hibitors have been shown to safely reduce ASCVD risk when
added to maximal tolerated statin-based regimens in people at
high coronary risk.675,676 Subgroup analyses suggest that their
safety proﬁle and their biochemical and clinical efﬁcacy are
similar when participants with CKD and without CKD are
compared. These trials recruited down to an eGFR of 20 ml/
min per 1.73 m2.677,678 Current examples of recommendations
for
from the cardiology
community (and licensed indications) include as an adjunct to

Dietary approaches.

Practice Point 3.15.1.5: Consider a plant-based “Mediter-

reduce cardiovascular risk.

(e.g.,

Diet and lipids have been comprehensively reviewed by
other clinical practice guidelines.679,681 In that work, the
Work Groups highlighted that
in general populations,
observational studies have associated plant-based diets that
fruit, vegetables, nuts,
include higher consumption of
legumes, ﬁsh, olive oil, yogurt, and whole grains, with lower
risk of CVD. Diets associated with higher risk are those
including high consumption of red and processed meats,
reﬁned carbohydrates, and salt. Vegetable sources of

3.15.2 Use of antiplatelet therapy

Recommendation 3.15.2.1: We recommend oral low-
dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemic
cardiovascular disease events (i.e., secondary pre-
vention) in people with CKD and established
ischemic cardiovascular disease (1C).

This recommendation places high value on the importance of
reducing recurrence of myocardial infarction, ischemic strokes,
or peripheral arterial disease complications in people with
CKD and established ischemic CVD due to the mortality and
disability associated with such complications. In secondary
prevention, trials have clearly shown the absolute beneﬁts of
low-dose aspirin substantially exceed the potential for bleeding
complications, creating certainty about net beneﬁts when
treating this population. In people with CKD without prior
ischemic CVD, the balance of beneﬁts and risks are uncertain
and may be counterbalanced—large RCTs are ongoing.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harm. Based on a number of large
RCTs in populations that are likely to be largely free from
CKD, lifelong use of low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) for the
prevention of recurrence of complications of ischemic CVD is
strongly recommended among people with known CVD (a
therapeutic approach referred to as secondary prevention).
Conversely, it is not possible to provide deﬁnitive recom-
mendations on when to use aspirin to prevent a ﬁrst ischemic
cardiovascular event (i.e., primary prevention) in people at
high risk, and a research recommendation is provided. This is
due to uncertainty of the net absolute value of such an
approach, as any reduction in the risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular events needs to be weighed against the risk of
major bleeding. It is important to consider CKD-speciﬁc data
in the totality of the evidence.

Key evidence from general populations is derived from a
2009 meta-analysis by the Anti-thrombotic Treatment Tria-
lists’ collaboration. The analyses included data on long-term
aspirin use versus control care in 16 secondary prevention
trials (approximately 17,000 people at high average risk,
approximately 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular
events [deﬁned as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardio-
vascular death]), and 6 primary prevention trials (approxi-
mately 95,000 participants at low average risk, approximately
660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events).685a In the
secondary prevention trials, allocation to aspirin reduced the
risk of both ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction by
about one-ﬁfth, such that an overall RR reduction for any
serious vascular event was 19% compared with controls
(RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75–0.87). This equated to a 1.49%

lower absolute risk of serious vascular events per year
compared with an estimated absolute risk of any major
bleeding, which was an order of magnitude smaller at
0.03% per year. Note that this hazard of major bleeding was
extrapolated from the primary prevention trials as stroke
causes and extracranial bleeds were generally not well
recorded in the relatively older secondary prevention trials
(Figure 38685a).

Some people with CKD have been included in antiplatelet
therapy trials. A recent Cochrane collaboration meta-analysis
of 40,597 trial participants with CKD recruited into anti-
platelet versus placebo trials and 11,805 recruited into anti-
platelet agent comparison trials found that allocation to
antiplatelet
therapy may reduce the RR of myocardial
infarction by approximately 12% (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79–
0.99). There was an expected increased risk of major bleeding,

Certainty of evidence. The 2009 meta-analysis by the Anti-
thrombotic Treatment Trialists’ collaboration on the effect of
aspirin compared with placebo in terms of the primary and
secondary prevention of CVD and safety among people with
and without CKD was assessed to have high risk of bias using
the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews
(ROBIS) checklist due to unclear identiﬁcation and selection
of studies, unclear data collection and study appraisal, and
high risk of bias for synthesis and ﬁndings (although we did
not contact the authors to clarify these details).685a This
review did not report on the evidence or certainty of
evidence assessments directly in the report. Given the
available evidence, the recommendation has a low certainty
of evidence (Level C).

Values and preferences. Maintaining QoL by minimizing
risk of worsening of ischemic heart disease and recurrent
stroke-related disability is important to both people with
CKD and caregivers.691 The Work Group considered that the
risk of bleeding would be considered acceptable by most
people with CKD once the clear net beneﬁts were explained
and gastroprotection was offered. The Work Group
some people with CKD without prior
considered that
ischemic coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterial
disease but at increased risk (e.g., due to diabetes) may still
wish to consider using aspirin and accept the risk of major
bleeding.687 Some people with CKD may also have a kidney
diagnosis that indirectly supports considering the use of
aspirin despite a lack of evidence (e.g., presumed or proven
renovascular disease). The Work Group is not aware of any
risk tools that could be used to help counsel such people
with CKD as to their expected net absolute beneﬁts and
risks based on risk factors of
the person with CKD,
including any difference by sex. (Note that scores to predict
cardiovascular risk are considered in Chapter 2.)

Resource use and costs. Low-dose aspirin is available at low

cost and does not require monitoring.

Considerations for implementation. Proton-pump inhibitors
(PPIs) are generally effective,692 safe, and low cost (although

occasionally associated with an interstitial nephritis), and
the Work Group considers that it is prudent to consider
bleeding risk and offers PPIs when prescribing antiplatelet
therapy or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such
therapies are combined.693

Rationale
Meta-analysis of trials has clearly established the cardio-
vascular beneﬁts of low-dose aspirin in people who have
established ASCVD. Any harm of bleeding is far outweighed
by the beneﬁts (unlike the situation for primary prevention,
where bleeding risk has been consistently identiﬁed in
large aspirin trials and cardiovascular beneﬁts to date have
not).

Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy
(e.g., P2Y12 inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance.

Bleeding from gastrointestinal mucosa with antiplatelet
therapy is likely to be due to their effect on hemostasis of pre-
existing mucosal
lesions. This hypothesis is supported by
P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel or ticagrelor) not reducing
the risk of bleeding in trials comparing them to aspirin.694,695
However, if people are aspirin intolerant, a P2Y12 inhibitor is
a noninferior alternative. Note that
the FDA
recommended that the coadministration of clopidogrel and
omeprazole (a PPI) should be avoided because omeprazole
reduces the effectiveness of clopidogrel. There is uncertainty
about the precise effect of omeprazole as pharmacokinetic
data are inconclusive, but PPIs with inhibition of CYP2C19
are preferred when using clopidogrel.696

in 2009,

Guidelines from the cardiology community provide rec-
ommendations for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for a
period after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous
coronary intervention. These guidelines recommend to
apply the same diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in
people with CKD.663 CKD does not modify the beneﬁts of
ticagrelor,697 and antiplatelet therapy doses do not need to
be modiﬁed at decreased eGFR. Note
that other
antithrombotic therapy choices and doses may need to
consider a person’s GFR.

Special considerations

International considerations. Given the clinical effectiveness
of low-dose aspirin and its low cost, there should not be many
barriers to accessing this medication in any setting.

3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary
artery disease

Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable
stress-test conﬁrmed ischemic heart disease, an
initial conservative approach using intensive medi-
cal therapy is an appropriate alternative to an initial
invasive strategy (2D).

This recommendation places high value on the ﬁnding from
recent, large trials in both general and CKD populations that
have suggested that intensive medical therapy is a suitable initial
strategy for the management of stable stress-test conﬁrmed
ischemic heart disease. It places value on the need for in-
terventions, which carry risk to people with CKD and sub-
stantial

cardiovascular outcomes before they are considered a standard of
care. Importantly, this recommendation should not apply to
those with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction
(e.g., ejection fraction <35%), or left main stem disease as they
were excluded from the deﬁnitive trials. It should be noted that
trials in CKD have not ruled out antianginal beneﬁts in people
with CKD (despite negative ﬁndings).

Balance of beneﬁts and harm. Beneﬁts. Beneﬁts should be
considered in the context of the totality of evidence in people
with and without CKD regarding interventions. Comparisons
between aggressive medical therapy alone and invasive in-
terventions do not support invasive strategies to reduce death
or prevent myocardial infarction.707,707a However, those with
frequent
gained
improvement with the invasive strategy707; thus, the beneﬁt
of an invasive strategy might be restricted to those with
angina. The reason for a lack of clear antianginal effect of an
invasive strategy in International Study of Comparative
Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches—
Chronic Kidney Disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD) needs
some
consideration, and key reasons relating to insufﬁcient power
due to protocol differences have been proposed.698 Although
low power to detect an effect on angina is a key potential
explanation for differences in ﬁndings between the 2 trials,
CKD-MBD and coronary calciﬁcation in CKD, which makes
the
microvascular disease more common and increases
technical challenge of revascularization, may also have partly
contributed to these differences.699

The ERT assessed the effects of angiography or coronary
intervention in people with CKD and ischemic heart disease
identiﬁed 4 other trials, but excluded mixed populations,
including ISCHEMIA-CKD, which recruited some people on
dialysis and some people who have received a kidney trans-
plant. The review found no clear beneﬁts on cardiovascular
outcomes in 3 other trials and raised a hypothesis about
beneﬁcial effects on mortality overall (Supplementary Table
S13700–704). Such an effect has not been observed in the
larger general population trials.

Harms. The harms of invasive strategies include the risk of
dialysis initiation, death, and stroke risk (stroke was inter-
estingly not periprocedural).707

Certainty of evidence. The ERT review was limited to trials
only recruiting people with CKD (and did not include the
ISCHEMIA-CKD trial discussed above due to the inclusion of
some people on dialysis and some people who have received a
kidney transplant). The overall certainty of the evidence
comparing coronary revascularization with optimal medical

therapy among people with CKD not undergoing KRT and
ischemic heart disease is very low (Supplementary Table
S13700–704). Most of
the RCTs reporting on the critical
outcomes (all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events,
kidney failure, and AKI) had some concerns regarding the
risk of bias, particularly with lack of blinding for the
outcome assessors, participants crossing over to the other
treatment group, and the selection of
reporting. The
certainty of the evidence was downgraded for all outcomes
because of imprecision. The certainty of the evidence for
cardiovascular mortality

publication bias was strongly suspected.

downgraded

was

Values and preferences. Although this was not conﬁrmed
by ISCHEMIA-CKD, antianginal beneﬁts of an invasive
strategy are apparent in general populations, and people with
symptoms may still elect for an initially invasive approach to
manage stable stress-test conﬁrmed coronary artery disease
after being counseled about the risks.

Resource use and costs. It is not possible to formally assess
the cost-effectiveness of intensive medical therapy versus an
initial invasive strategy due to mixed ﬁndings from the evi-
dence in people with stable ischemic heart disease. However,
invasive strategies will have higher cost
implications to
healthcare systems, people with CKD, or both.

Considerations for implementation. Access and availability
of invasive therapies will vary in different healthcare sys-
tems, as might the availability of medications for maximal
medical therapy. The key to implementation is to encourage
the understanding of the value of full therapy as compared
with invasive therapy so that healthcare providers and
people with CKD understand the risks and beneﬁts of
invasive strategies. Given the costs of invasive strategies,
there may be additional value to implementing this
recommendation.

Rationale
Evidence suggests that the key indication for an initial invasive
strategy to manage stable ischemic heart disease is based on
therapy is a suitable
symptoms, and intensive medical
approach if symptom control is satisfactory in people with or
without CKD. In CKD, the antianginal beneﬁts of an initially
invasive approach have not been demonstrated.

sive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKD
with acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levels

systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main

The ISCHEMIA trial has been described as deeply dis-

recommendation should not

It should also be noted that people with left ventricular
dysfunction (i.e., ejection fraction <35%) or left main
disease were excluded from the deﬁnitive ISCHEMIA
trial.707a The Work Group considers that certain design
the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial may have led to
features of
angina beneﬁts not being detected, and the trial results
should not rule out angina beneﬁts in people with CKD
(see above). If an invasive strategy is pursued, there are
effective strategies to reduce the risk of contrast-induced
AKI (Chapter 4).708

The totality of the evidence from the CKD-speciﬁc trials is
consistent with no net difference between an initial conser-
vative approach using aggressive medical therapy versus an
invasive strategy when treating stable stress-test conﬁrmed
ischemic heart disease. This is consistent with the large gen-
eral population-based ISCHEMIA trial.707a

different diagnostic and management strategies.

In CKD, the same principles to diagnose and manage atrial
ﬁbrillation should be used as in people without CKD.

Prevalence and consequences. Atrial ﬁbrillation is the com-
monest sustained arrhythmia, with risk increasing steeply with
increasing age (earlier in men than women).709 There is a
particularly high prevalence in people with CKD. Crude
prevalence ranging from 16% to 21% has been reported in
people with CKD not requiring KRT.710 In the cohorts
contributing to the CKD-PC, adults with CKD G3, A1 had
an adjusted risk of atrial ﬁbrillation of 1.2–1.5, increasing to
an adjusted risk of 4.2 by CKD stages G5, A3 (Figure 3912).
Atrial ﬁbrillation can directly

perhaps directly or through shared risk factors, with increased

Prophylaxis against stroke and systemic thromboembolism.
Recent cardiology guidelines recommend a risk factor–based
approach to stroke thromboprophylaxis decisions in atrial
ﬁbrillation using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension,
Age $75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular
disease, Age 65 to 74, and Sex category (female) (CHA2DS2-
VASc) stroke risk score. They recommend that only people at
“low stroke risk” (CHA2DS2-VASc score ¼ 0 in men, or 1 in
women) should not be offered antithrombotic therapy. Oral
anticoagulants should be considered for stroke prevention
with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women,
considering net clinical beneﬁt and values and preferences
of people with CKD. Oral anticoagulants are clearly recom-
mended for stroke prevention in people with atrial ﬁbrillation
and a CHA2DS2-VASc score $2 in men or $3 in women.709
Our Work Group considered that oral anticoagulation for
thromboprophylaxis should nearly always be considered for
preventing stroke in people with decreased eGFR and atrial
ﬁbrillation (Figure 40). The presence of decreased GFR is a
risk for
thromboembolic stroke in people with atrial
ﬁbrillation.710–712 It has been estimated that approximately
95% of people with an eGFR of <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2

Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of
non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
(NOACs) in preference to vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,
warfarin) for thromboprophylaxis in atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion in people with CKD G1–G4 (1C).

This recommendation puts high value on the use of NOACs, also
referred to as direct-acting oral anticoagulants or DOACs, in
people with CKD due to their simpler pharmacokinetic proﬁle,
dosing, and monitoring than vitamin K antagonists and due to
their improved efﬁcacy and relatively similar safety proﬁle.
Although people with CKD G4–G5 have been understudied in
RCTs, implementation in such groups can be achieved after
considering choice of NOAC and dosing.

Key information

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. Beneﬁts. Data from 42,411
participants who received NOACs and 29,272 participants
who received warfarin in 4 phase III trials were meta-analyzed
in 2014. Such trials largely excluded people with CKD G4–G5
but did include large numbers of participants with earlier
stages of CKD. Overall, NOACs signiﬁcantly reduced the risk
of stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared with
warfarin (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73–0.91). This beneﬁt was a
result largely from reduced risk of hemorrhagic strokes (RR:
0.49; 95% CI: 0.38–0.64). There were large amounts of data
on stroke in those with a CrCl of <50 ml/min, and the
relative beneﬁts were consistent and clearly evident in people
with CKD. There were also consistent effects in subgroup
analyses by age, sex, prior diabetes, prior stroke, and CHADS2
score.714 A more recent meta-analysis published in 2021 only
focused on subgroups with CKD and included data from 7
trials of NOACs versus warfarin in atrial ﬁbrillation. It also
reported a 19% reduced risk of stroke/thromboembolic
complications in the NOAC group (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:
0.69–0.97).715 Data in CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to
studies.715 Our evidence review aimed to
observational
collect information on subtypes of outcome from subgroup
analyses reporting results speciﬁcally in people with CKD.
Evidence of efﬁcacy in the large trials is mainly for the
outcomes of stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, but our review
only found data from 3 trials for these outcomes resulting

Harms. The 2014 meta-analysis of 4 large phase III trials
found that NOACs reduced the risk of death from any
cause by 10%, conﬁrming net safety (RR: 0.90; 95% CI:
0.85–0.95). Compared with warfarin, NOACs reduced the
intracranial hemorrhage (deﬁned as hemorrhagic
risk of
stroke, epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage)
by about one-half (RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.39–0.59), and the
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was increased by about
one-quarter (RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01–1.55). Overall, there
was no clear effect on the combination of these 2 safety
outcomes referred to as major bleeding (RR: 0.86; 95% CI:
0.73–1.00).714 There were large amounts of data on major
bleeding in those with a CrCl of <50 ml/min,
so
reassuring safety data clearly extended to people with
CKD. There were also consistent safety data in subgroup
analyses by age,
stroke, and
CHADS2 score. There was a suggestion that major bleeding
was signiﬁcantly reduced in people attending centers where
time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) range
was <66% compared with centers with $66% time in range
(interaction P ¼ 0.02). This suggests that beneﬁts of NOACs
are in part a result of their simpler pharmacokinetic proﬁle

sex, prior diabetes, prior

and dosing.714 The 2021 meta-analysis that focused on CKD
subgroups from 7 trials found that bleeding events were also
not signiﬁcantly different among those allocated NOACs
versus warfarin (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.58–1.18).715 Data in
CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to observational studies.715
Our evidence review was again limited to a small number of
studies reporting subtypes of bleeding outcomes, and so
analyses found imprecise estimates of treatment effect. The
ﬁndings were qualitatively consistent with the totality of the
evidence (Figure 42, Supplementary Table S15716–722). The
review raised a hypothesis that some NOACs may be more
likely to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, given the
evidence of effect modiﬁcation by time in therapeutic range in
the warfarin group, we have not provided speciﬁc
recommendations to prefer certain NOACs.

Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of the evidence
comparing NOACs with warfarin among people with CKD
and atrial ﬁbrillation is low (Supplementary Tables S14716–721
and S15716–722). Most of the RCTs evaluating the critical
outcomes were considered to have a low risk of bias. The
critical outcome of stroke was reported as any stroke,
ischemic stroke, and/or hemorrhagic stroke. Because there

Values and preferences. High value on the use of NOACs
included the conclusion that the simple dosing and lack of
INR monitoring compared with vitamin K antagonists would
lead to a substantial reduction in burden for those with an
indication for anticoagulation and their health services. There
is also good evidence for improved efﬁcacy and a relatively
similar safety proﬁle. Most fully informed people with CKD
would be expected to select a NOAC over a vitamin K
antagonist.

Resource use and costs. NOACs have been shown to be
cost-effective for stroke prevention in atrial ﬁbrillation and
may even be cost-saving in people with CKD. Vitamin K
antagonist use may be associated with higher costs and

Considerations for implementation. A decision not to anti-
coagulate for thromboembolic prophylaxis due to low risk
would ideally be re-evaluated at each consultation and at least
every 6 months. When using antithrombotic therapy in
people with CKD, it is prudent to treat modiﬁable risk factors
for bleeding (e.g., alcohol intake) and use gastroprophylaxis
with a PPI, particularly when combined with antiplatelet
therapy.

Rationale
A number of large RCTs demonstrated that NOACs reduce
the risk of intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin and,
overall, modestly reduce mortality in people with atrial

Chapter 4: Medication management and drug
stewardship in CKD

Medication management is an important component of the
care of people with CKD. Medications can be highly beneﬁ-
cial, but some may be toxic, are excreted by the kidney, may
have narrow therapeutic windows, or may have no proven
clear evidence of beneﬁt or indication in people with CKD.
Drug stewardship refers to the effective, safe, and sus-
tainable use of medications by all staff and physicians,
encompassing the whole cycle of medication use. Medica-
tions need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored for efﬁ-
cacy and safety, and when they do not or no longer serve
their intended purpose, discontinued. This chapter discusses
key concepts in the processes of drug stewardship in people
with CKD. It is beyond the scope of this guideline to list all
the medications that may have altered risks/beneﬁts in
people with CKD. Such information is widely available in
documents that may exist at local, regional, or national
bodies (e.g., British National Formulary: www.bnf.org) and
in textbooks of pharmacology. However, we describe case
examples to highlight the key classes of commonly pre-
scribed medications in people with CKD. This guidance is
based on knowledge of pharmacology that has universal
relevance. In many cases, knowledge of altered risks/beneﬁts
of medications comes, however, from observational studies
and case reports from routine care.

4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety

Abnormal kidney function results in alteration in pharma-
cokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and for people with CKD,
as the GFR worsens, so does the prevalence of polypharmacy
and comorbidities.725 People with CKD are at increased risk
of medication errors and inappropriate prescribing (noted
to be up to 37% in ambulatory outpatient studies and up
to 43% in long-term care studies726,727). Thus,
improved
in
understanding
developing care plans and medication review is strongly
recommended.

and collaboration with pharmacists

People with CKD have reduced ability to excrete medica-
tions and/or their metabolites (which may increase adverse
event risk or exaggerate/diminish efﬁcacy) and increased
sensitivity to medications (e.g., those bound to albumin in
hypoalbuminemic
such as nephrotic syndrome).
Additional issues include nephrotoxicity, diminished toler-
ance of side effects in the context of coexisting comorbidities
or older age, and lack of adequate evidence for either beneﬁt
or harm of speciﬁc compounds, due to historical exclusion of
people with (advanced) CKD from most clinical trials.727,728

states

As in all medical decision-making, healthcare providers
should consider the indication, beneﬁt-risk proﬁle, and po-
tential nephrotoxicity while balancing accessibility, availabil-
ity, local health policies, cultural practices, affordability, and
patient preferences. Where available, consultation with
pharmacists as part of the multidisciplinary team is encour-
aged to assure optimized comprehensive medication man-
agement and to improve pharmacoequity.

Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more sus-
ceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. When
prescribing such medications to people with CKD, always
consider the beneﬁts versus potential harms.

Between 18%–20% of people with CKD G3–G5 receive at
least one potentially inappropriate nephrotoxic medication
annually, primarily NSAIDs, nephrotoxic antivirals, and
bisphosphonates.729 Nephrotoxic medications may
be
indicated in people with CKD if expected beneﬁts exceed
potential harms.730 However, whenever possible, healthcare
providers should strive to use non-nephrotoxic alternatives.
Common nephrotoxic medications to be aware of and
potential alternatives that could be prescribed instead are
listed in Table 31.725,731–738 Although some nephrotoxic
medications have viable alternatives, the alternatives may be
less potent or there is limited comparison data on clinical
outcomes, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and ther-
apeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people with
CKD receiving medications with narrow therapeutic win-
dows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity, both in
outpatient practice and in hospital settings.

Ensuring a safe use of medication requires careful moni-
toring for adverse effects and efﬁcacy. A key example includes
the need to monitor potassium and creatinine during the
initial weeks of treatment with ACEi and ARBs (Figure 21).23
Medications such as gentamicin and vancomycin have a
narrow therapeutic
trough levels
commonly associated with AKI, and so require close
monitoring of GFR and medication levels during prolonged
treatment.731 Other medications,

methotrexate,

Kidney disease can be induced or accelerated by the use of
certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal rem-
edies, and other dietary supplements. One of the most used
class of OTC analgesic medications is NSAIDs. NSAIDs are
associated with interstitial nephritis, analgesic nephropathy,
and hypertension.739 Indiscriminate chronic OTC NSAID use
has been associated with a higher risks of kidney failure
compared with nonuse and should be discouraged.740–743
However, judicious NSAID use, under careful supervision of
a nephrologist, may be preferred to other pain medications
such as opioids that have stronger associations with adverse
events.744,745 PPIs are also common OTC medications in
some countries that have been associated with AKI and
CKD due to tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute interstitial
nephritis.733,734

The use of herbal compounds remains highly prevalent in
some countries and cultures.746 These products are often used
in an unmonitored setting without the input of healthcare
providers. Many of these remedies are composed of natural
compounds with complex active ingredients that have not
been evaluated in people with CKD and/or that may lead to
many different adverse effects. The frequency of CKD
associated with herbal remedy use is not known and is
likely different in different parts of the world, depending on
local availability and reasons for use. Examples include
aristolochic acid nephropathy or nephrotoxicity due to
alkaloid compounds often found in Chinese herbal
remedies.747 However, cases of nephrotoxicity have been
reported for many other herbal remedies globally.746,748,749
The potential toxicity of herbal remedies may be enhanced

by coexisting volume depletion and by other illness or
medication use.

Dietary supplements are readily available in most countries
around the world and are usually not classiﬁed as OTC med-
ications. Because of this, their regulation for identity and safety
can vary widely. Although laws pertaining to dietary supple-
ment labeling prohibit speciﬁc claims for the treatment or
prevention of disease,
these products are widely used as
“alternative” or “complementary” therapy. Patients and pro-
viders often assume that these products are at least safe and
possibly effective. Their pharmacokinetics may be unknown
and potential toxicity unstudied. Classic examples include
creatine supplements used for body building that have been
associated with allergic interstitial nephritis.750,751 Another
example is vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements, which in
excess can lead to tubular calcium oxalate crystal deposition.752
Healthcare providers are encouraged to routinely inquire
about the use of herbal remedies and recommend stopping
any unprescribed alternative remedy that may pose a threat
for (kidney) health. Figure 45747,753,754 lists common herbal

There are growing concerns regarding the use of falsiﬁed
and substandard medications in low- to lower-middle–in-
come countries as they pose potential harm, particularly to
those people at risk of and with CKD. Patients and their
families should be aware that medication falsiﬁcation is often
associated with illicit internet supply. Many vulnerable com-
munities and people with low health literacy and those in
countries with less rigorous regulatory systems are more at
risk of medication falsiﬁcation. Therefore, increased global
awareness is important, and people with CKD should be
provided with appropriate education and follow-up with
relevant support in accordance with local health policies.

Medications and pregnancy.

Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications to
people with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, always
review teratogenicity potential and provide regular repro-
ductive and contraceptive counseling in accordance with
the values and preferences of the person with CKD.

When pregnancy is not desired, we note that while the
effect of different forms of contraception on GFR is un-
known,756 oral contraceptives are associated with increased

BP and hypertension.757 Nonoral hormonal contraceptives
have a less clear impact on BP.757

Pregnancy may pose a risk of CKD progression for people
with established CKD. In addition, some recommended medi-
cations to slow or prevent CKD progression are teratogenic (such

4.2 Dose adjustments by level of GFR

Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications
cleared by the kidneys.

Many medications and/or their active metabolites are
excreted by the kidneys. Failure to properly account for the
effect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regi-
mens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverse
events.725,728 Although guidelines for adjustment of
the
dosing regimen at varying severities of CKD provided by
the manufacturer are widely available in pharmacopeias,
textbooks, online references, or local procedures, there may
be signiﬁcant differences in information provided by these
resources.768

Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings,
validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate for
drug dosing.

Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for
drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow
therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situ-
ations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable, use of
equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or
measured GFR may be indicated.

An assessment of GFR is important for guiding decisions
related to the choice and dosing of medications. Section 1.2
addresses the accuracy of validated eGFR equations, as well
as indications for the use of eGFRcr-cys or mGFR.

There is inconsistency between this guidance and those
found in the package inserts or classic source references for
drug dosing. Regulatory agencies have not universally
required pharmacokinetics in abnormal kidney function for
medication approval.769 In addition, although the Cockcroft-
Gault formula for estimating CrCl has been used in many past
pharmacokinetic studies that serve as the basis for the drug
dosing, there are multiple concerns with that equation. It
was developed in an era when the need for standardization
of creatinine measurements was not appreciated, women
and individuals of Black race were not included, and there
are concerns about use of weight, which can be impacted
by edema or obesity.770 However, to date, few studies have
been conducted to compare different equations for eGFR in
the context of drug dosing/kinetics, etc.

There is now a recognition by major regulatory agencies
that “any contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically
applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonable
to assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies.”770,771

Practice Point 4.2.4: In people with extremes of body
weight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) may
be indicated, especially for medications with a narrow
therapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentration
to be effective.

For assessment of CKD, it is relevant to compare the GFR
according to a standard body size. For this reason, GFR
estimating equations have been developed in units of ml/min
per 1.73 m2. However, because drug clearance is more
strongly associated with nonindexed eGFR (ml/min) than
indexed eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m2), in very small or large
individuals, this can result in over- or underdosing, respec-
tively, as well as noninitiation of certain medications.772,773
Nonindexed eGFR can be obtained by multiplying the
indexed eGFR results by the person’s BSA and dividing by
1.73 m2, or by using an appropriate online calculator.

Practice Point 4.2.5: Consider and adapt drug dosing in
people where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the ﬁltration
markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state.
In people with rapidly changing health status, it can be a
challenge to estimate the GFR. Serum concentrations of
ﬁltration markers may be changing because of changes in true
GFR and/or in non-GFR determinants of the marker (Section
1.2). In such settings for people who require medications that
are impacted by or could impact GFR, healthcare providers
should regularly assess risk, beneﬁts, and value of
the
medication, and consider higher or
than
indicated. Where possible, use medication level testing to
guide dosing.730,774

lower doses

Special considerations

Dose adjustments in cancer. GFR plays a large role in
determining anticancer therapy, including anticancer agent
selection, dosing, and eligibility for investigational drugs and
clinical trials.775,776 Notwithstanding its lack of validation and
its relative inaccuracy compared with other validated eGFR
equations, the Cockroft-Gault equation continues to be one
of
the most commonly used eGFR methods for these
people.775,776 An evaluation of eGFR equation performance
against mGFR determined by plasma clearance of 51Cr-
EDTA in 1200 people with solid tumors observed the
eGFRcr
(CKD-EPI)
predicted mGFR with greater accuracy than Cockroft-
Gault.136 We advise that
the same approach to GFR
evaluation described in Section 1.2 be adopted in oncology
practice and clinical trials.136,764 BSA-adjusted eGFR may be
indicated for selected speciﬁc situations like carboplatin

preferred method to guide the initial dosing for a select group
of anticancer drugs including, but not limited to, carboplatin,
cisplatin, and methotrexate (Section 1.2).

Dose adjustment in children/neonates. In addition to the
usual weight-based dosing for children, speciﬁc guidance on
drug dosing should be followed for neonates who have lower
GFR than those outside the neonatal period.

Dose adjustment in pregnancy. Creatinine decreases physi-
ologically during pregnancy due to glomerular hyper-
ﬁltration, and BSA varies. This creates challenges for using
GFR or eGFR equations.54 In such settings for people who

Figure 46 | Suggested steps in the process of medication review and reconciliation. Best practices for medication review and reconciliation
in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) include 8 steps728 and can be summarized as follows: (i) obtain an accurate medication list from the
patient; (ii) evaluate whether all medications are medically necessary or whether any other medications is required; (iii) assess whether current
therapy represents the “drug of choice” for each indication, individualized for each patient; (iv) evaluate the medication dosage and regimen,
taking into consideration related factors such as liver dysfunction, patient size, or weight (e.g., amputation, muscle wasting, and over- or
underweight); (v) review the medication list for drug interactions, including drug-drug, drug-disease, drug-laboratory, and drug-food
interactions; (vi) ensure that proper monitoring takes place; (vii) determine whether there are any barriers to patient adherence, and evaluate
relevant laboratory values; and (viii) identify and resolve any discrepancies between the medications list and the one in the medical record;
communication of performed changes in the medication chart with other physicians is necessary given the role of multiple prescribers involved
in the care of patients with CKD.729

evaluated medication review by clinical practices in people
with CKD, observing reductions in the use of inappropriate
medications and medication-related problems, both in
outpatient and inpatient settings.765,766 The most frequent
involved altering dosage or dose interval and
reviews
discontinuing NSAIDs. More frequent medication reviews
may be needed in older adults with complex medication
regimens compared with younger people with CKD.

In the context of good drug stewardship, healthcare pro-
viders should be aware of the issue of “prescribing cascade.” A
prescribing cascade is a sequence of events that begins when
an adverse event is misinterpreted as a new medical condition
and a subsequent drug is prescribed to treat this adverse
event.779 Before prescribing new medications to address
newly reported symptoms, it is important to ﬁrst assess if
the symptoms represent a side effect
from an existing
medication. An example of a prescribing cascade is as
follows: peripheral edema because of calcium channel
blocker may be managed by initiation of a new medication
(i.e., diuretic), which can lead to additional
adverse
reactions (e.g., hypokalemia and dizziness).

Practice Point 4.3.2: If medications are discontinued during
an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when to
restart the discontinued medications to the affected person
and healthcare providers, and ensure documentation in the
medical record.

Sick day rules have been endorsed as useful guidance to people
with CKD in the setting of acute, dehydrating illness. Speciﬁcally,
patients receive guidance to temporarily stop the following
medications: sulfonylureas, ACEi, diuretics/direct renin in-
hibitors, metformin, ARBs, NSAIDs, and SGLT2i (often described
with the acronym SADMANS).780 However, there is a paucity of
evidence to support sick day rules to prevent AKI or other
relevant outcomes.781,782
suggest

in recognizing
dehydrating illness or about which drugs to stop and when to

for sick day rules to be implemented appropriately. The most
reported problem is failure to restart the medication.784 The
plan to restart medications should be detailed in the medical
records and clearly communicated to the patients. Patients may
additionally beneﬁt from medication review within a month to
ensure appropriate medications are restarted.

Instead, data

Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation of
medications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i)
in the 48–72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the
acute management of adverse effects as a precautionary
measure to prevent complications. However, note that
failure to restart these medications after the event or pro-
cedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point
4.3.2).

Temporary discontinuation of medications to manage
adverse events is indicated in most cases. However, fear for
adverse event recurrence often results in failure to resume
treatments. In CKD, hyperkalemia or AKI are not uncommon
adverse effects of RASi treatment, to which clinical guidelines
recommend discontinuation of RASi and therapy reinitiation
at low dosages when the event is resolved.23,29,790,791 Despite
this advice, permanent discontinuation of RASi seems to be
the most common clinical reaction to occurrence of adverse
events.580,792 Observational studies consistently show that
withholding RASi medication compared with continuing
treatment after these adverse events is associated with a
lower recurrence of adverse events, but conversely a higher
risk of MACE and death, for which prevention is one of the

In all these situations, enhanced communication with the
patients, and between inpatient and outpatient teams, is neces-
sary to ensure resumption of medications in a timely manner.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations. Many children with CKD with un-
derlying tubular disorders have an obligate urine output irre-
spective of their hydration status and are at particularly high risk
of hypotension and AKI during an acute dehydrating illness.
Therefore, temporary discontinuation of medications such as
diuretics and RASi that may lead to serious complications of
volume depletion, such as hypotension and AKI, should be
considered during illnesses. If medications are discontinued
during an illness, a clear plan of when to restart the discontinued
medications should be communicated to people with CKD and
documented in the medical record.

Under-recognition of CKD diagnoses in medical records is
associated with medication errors,
including potentially
inappropriate prescription of nephrotoxic medications.729

Practice Point 4.3.1.2: Establish collaborative relationships
with other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/or
use tools to ensure and improve drug stewardship in people
with CKD to enhance management of
their complex
medication regimens.

Clinical pharmacists are highly qualiﬁed experts in medi-
cines and, as part of the multidisciplinary team, can play a
pivotal role in improving the quality of care and ensuring
patient safety in a range of ways. This includes carrying out
structured medication reviews for people with CKD and
associated health problems and improving patient safety,
outcomes, and value through a person-centered approach.798–
800 In addition and where clinical pharmacists are not avail-
able, clinical decision support systems can optimize this
process through automation and decision support integrated
into the EMRs, supporting drug stewardship through alerts to
healthcare providers on the need for dose adjustment to
prevent adverse effects. In RCTs enrolling people with CKD,
electronic clinical decision support systems have demon-
strated efﬁcacy in reducing medication errors, avoiding drug-
drug interactions, and improving dose adjustment of medi-
cations excreted by the kidneys.801–806 Recognizing that many
of these tools may not be available in all communities, the
concepts of regular review and evaluation of medications by a
knowledgeable healthcare provider are a critical component
of care for people with CKD.

4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship

Special considerations

Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with
CKD regarding the expected beneﬁts and possible risks of
medications so that they can identify and report adverse
events that can be managed.

People with kidney disease have a role in drug stewardship,
and given that they may receive medications from non-
nephrology healthcare providers, people with CKD should be
encouraged to inform those prescribers that they have kidney
disease to facilitate consideration of doses and potential side
effect of medications. Thus, education and information for
people with CKD inclusive for their population (i.e., literacy
level and languages) are encouraged. Although brochures and
conversations may be useful,
interactive electronic health
applications have been shown to be acceptable to patients and
may lead them to apply the knowledge gained more effec-
tively.793–797 Practical implementation tips involve printing
out the results of the most recent eGFR estimation for the
patient to bring along in future healthcare consultations and/
or write down a list of ongoing medications to alert other
healthcare providers of medication risks and beneﬁts.

A diagnosis of CKD should always be reﬂected in medical
records, as this will alert physicians on the need to consider
adjusting or avoiding certain medications or procedures.

Pediatric considerations. Parents and carers should be cen-
tral
to drug stewardship for children with CKD, with
increasing involvement from the young person as they move
toward transition.

4.4 Imaging studies

Practice Point 4.4.1: Consider the indication for imaging
studies in accordance with general population indications.
Risks and beneﬁts of imaging studies should be determined
on an individual basis in the context of their CKD.

The use of iodinated radiocontrast media has been asso-
ciated with the occurrence of AKI, with varying rates reported
in observational studies depending on the population studied,
the type, route and dose of agent being used, and the deﬁ-
nition of nephrotoxicity. The term “contrast-induced AKI”
has been traditionally coined to describe this condition,807 but
subsequent research characterizing this entity suggests causal
links to be weak,807–809 and the term “contrast-associated AKI
(CA-AKI)” has been suggested instead.

procedures using validated tools.

The reported risk of CA-AKI is higher with procedures
involving arterial administration compared with venous
administration of contrast.814 This difference in risk may be
due to differences in patient populations (those who require
arterial contrast are likely to have comorbidities
that
increase the likelihood of AKI) or to differences in the
nephrotoxicity of intra-arterial contrast material.

Known risk factors for CA-AKI are advanced age, heart

glycemia, and use of RASi.815 The highest risk for AKI is

consensus statements from the radiology societies in people

undergoing elective investigation.

The Work Group refers the reader to the most recent
radiology guidelines speciﬁcally noting the difference between
intravenous and intra-arterial radiocontrast:
(cid:3) Use of low-osmolality contrast media and iso-osmolarity

contrast media

(cid:3) Use of minimum radiocontrast dose to achieve a diagnostic

study

(cid:3) Withdrawal of nonessential potentially nephrotoxic medi-
cations (e.g., NSAIDs, diuretics, aminoglycosides, ampho-
tericin, platins, zoledronate, and methotrexate) in people
with AKI or eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for 24–48
hours before and 48 hours after radiocontrast exposure
(cid:3) In people with eGFR >30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and without
evidence of AKI, metformin need not be stopped before
iodinated contrast media (ICM) administration, and there
is no need for testing to evaluate GFR afterward. For people
with AKI or an eGFR #30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, it remains
appropriate to stop metformin at the time of or before ICM
injection and should not be restarted for at least 48 hours
and only then if GFR remains stable and the ongoing use of
metformin has been reassessed by the clinical team.818
(cid:3) Given the lack of strong evidence demonstrating that
continuing RAASi is beneﬁcial, referring healthcare pro-
viders should consider withholding RAASi in people at risk
for $48 hours before elective contrast-enhanced CT to
avoid the potential
for hypotension and hyperkalemia
should CA-AKI develop. RAASi may be restarted if CA-AKI
does not occur or after the return of GFR to baseline.
(cid:3) Consideration of avoiding dehydration for people not un-
dergoing dialysis and who have eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73
m2 or AKI and receiving intravenous contrast.815,819

(cid:3) Use of N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, furosemide, dopa-
mine, fenoldopam, or calcium channel blockers as pre-
ventative measures of CA-AKI has not been shown to be a
consistent beneﬁt.813

(cid:3) Prophylactic pericontrast hemodialysis has been shown to

be potentially harmful and is not recommended.813

Special considerations

Global access to contrast agents. The preference of contrast
agent may depend on availability and cost, particularly in
lower-income countries and lower-middle–income countries.

4.4.2 Gadolinium-containing contrast media
Gadolinium chelates used during magnetic resonance imag-
ing has previously been reported to cause nephrogenic sys-
temic ﬁbrosis (NSF) before 2010, and the mechanisms have
been articulated.820 Note that incidence of this condition has
not been reported later than 2012, thus raising the question as
to the true risk of this condition.821

Practice Point 4.4.2.1: For people with GFR <30 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 (CKD G4–G5) who require gadolinium-con-
taining contrast media, preferentially offer them American
College of Radiology group II and III gadolinium-based
contrast agents.

People who are at greatest risk for NSF include those with
AKI, undergoing KRT, and those with CKD G4–G5. Most
unconfounded cases have been associated with American
College of Radiology group I gadolinium-based contrast

Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314

media (e.g., gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and
gadoversetamide), and there is additional risk with repeated
doses.822,823

Hence, in people with GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the
linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-based
use of newer
contrast media such as gadobenate dimeglumine, gadobutrol,
gadoteridol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoxetate disodium
should be preferred.824,825

Special considerations

Global access to gadolinium-contrast agents. There are cost
implications in lower-income countries and lower-middle–
income countries as the nonlinear-chelated preparations are
more expensive.

Pediatric considerations. Considerations speciﬁc to the use of
gadolinium preparations in young children and neonates must
also be contemplated in addition to the general admonishments
against their use in situations of GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
In particular, the FDA currently does not license any gadolin-
ium-based contrast media product for use in children <2 years
of age and, likewise, the European Medicines Agency cautions
against the use of any gadolinium-based contrast agents in a
child <1 year of age. The risk of NSF in pediatric populations
appears to be low, but data are limited.822,823

In recognition of the inability to accurately measure GFR
in the neonate and, by extension, the clearance of compounds
such as gadolinium, all nephrologists and radiologists must
exercise caution in terms of use of gadolinium-based contrast
media in this potentially high-risk population, and all other
imaging modalities should be considered before choosing one
requiring gadolinium exposure. Although not based on spe-
ciﬁc evidence, some have suggested the avoidance of high-risk
gadolinium agents in very young children (e.g., neonates
younger than 4 weeks of age).826

Moreover because of kidney immaturity in fetuses, neo-
nates, and infants, this population (and consequently preg-
nant women because of the risk to the fetus) is considered
potentially at risk for NSF.827 However, although the data are
limited, the number of reported cases of NSF in the pediatric
population is lower than in the adult population.828 There
is no convincing evidence that pediatric populations have
an increased risk compared with adults. The risk of NSF
in pediatric patients appears to be low, but data are
limited.823

5.1 Referral to specialist kidney care services

Early identiﬁcation and referral to specialist kidney care ser-
vices for people with CKD has the potential to reverse, delay,
or prevent progression of disease and is a key focus of in-
ternational initiatives in the context of the global “epidemic”
of kidney disease. The goals of early identiﬁcation and referral
to specialist kidney care services are several-fold and include:
(cid:3) Ensuring a speciﬁc diagnosis for CKD is sought, where

appropriate

(cid:3) Provision of speciﬁc therapy based on diagnosis
(cid:3) Slowing/arresting CKD progression
(cid:3) Evaluation and management of comorbid conditions
(cid:3) Prevention and management of CVD
(cid:3) Identiﬁcation, prevention, and management of CKD-spe-
ciﬁc complications (e.g., malnutrition, anemia, bone dis-
ease, and acidosis)

(cid:3) Planning and preparation for KRT (e.g., choice of modality,
access-placement and care, and preemptive transplantation)

(cid:3) Psychosocial support
(cid:3) Provision of conservative care and palliative care options

where required.

Referral to specialists for assessment does not necessarily
equate to access to or need for multidisciplinary care, and
differentiation of the value of each is important. Specialist
referral to aid in ascertainment of cause and prognosis can be
seen as separate from care and support services targeted at
complications, and delay of, and preparation for progressive
CKD. Application of risk prediction tools (Chapter 2) may aid
identifying those at risk of
decision-making in terms of
progression and determining action thresholds for multidis-
ciplinary care and placement of access for KRT or referral to
transplantation. Current recommendations to use validated
risk equations to ascertain those at high probability of kidney
failure within 2 years should prompt actions that align with
provision of appropriate education activities, review of un-
derstanding, and decision-making, and prompting referrals to
other healthcare providers (e.g., vascular access surgeons,
transplant teams, etc.).

Risk-based referral was compared with guideline referral
criteria in a cross-sectional study from the UK.829 Analysis
revealed that approximately 40% of patients classiﬁed as at
high risk of progression to kidney failure by KFRE (>3% by 5
years) were missed by guideline referral criteria. Moreover, a
model predicting the timing of clinical outcomes, validated in
a multicenter prospective cohort study of 1517 people aged
$65 years with eGFR 10–30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, showed
good performance for predicting the timing and occurrence
of KRT. Using this prediction model to guide referral for
vascular access preparation resulted in less unnecessary
arteriovenous ﬁstula surgeries than using eGFR thresholds.830
In this section, we consider the evidence relating to timely
referral for planning KRT in people with progressive CKD.
The literature concerning late referral has been remarkably
consistent with both clinical studies and narrative reviews
identifying several adverse consequences of late referral and
related beneﬁts of early referral (Table 34).

Both individual and healthcare system factors are associ-
ated with late referral for KRT planning. A systematic review
of 18 studies and physician surveys identiﬁed speciﬁc factors

responsible for late referral for KRT as shown in Table 35.831
We encourage each nephrology program to explore factors
associated with late referral
to improve referral patterns
appropriately.

People with kidney disease have never been randomized to
early or late referral to nephrology services, and the deﬁnition of
late referral in the published studies varies between 1 and 12
months before the start of KRT. Three months is probably less
than the absolute minimum amount of time required for
assessment, education, preparation for KRT, and creation of
access, but 3 months is the most frequently employed deﬁnition.
A systematic review of 40 studies showed that early referral
was associated with better clinical and biochemical outcomes
such as improvement in mortality at 3 and 5 years, decrease in
hospitalizations, better access to vascular access and KRT with
peritoneal dialysis, as well as improvements in BP, hemoglobin,
and serum albumin (Table 36).832 A retrospective study of
105,219 patients (early referral 21,024 patients and late referral
84,195 patients) showed that early referral to nephrology care
was associated with slower progression of CKD as signiﬁcantly
more patients in early referral group did not change their CKD
stage (65%–72.9% vs. 52%–64.6%, P < 0.05).833

Local practice and resources will dictate local referral
practices. Regardless of the healthcare system, delay, or pre-
vention of progression of both CKD and its complications
will be of value to both individuals and healthcare systems.
Local organizations will determine the best methods of
communication and interaction between people with CKD,
kidney care specialists, the multidisciplinary team, and pri-
mary care physicians.

Technology may be used to promote

appropriate
nephrology referral. Embedding clinical practice guidelines
information systems may effectively create a
into clinical
reminder system for primary care physicians. Clinical deci-
sion support systems could also improve referral criteria
adherence. The smartphone application, Nefroconsultor,
which uses KDIGO referral criteria was shown to increase the
rate of appropriate referral by 28.8%.834

Implementation of referral guidelines will inevitably lead
to an increased workload for specialist kidney care services.
However, introduction of local initiatives in conjunction with
primary care providers can improve the appropriateness and
quality of the referral. A checklist for goal-directed care in
CKD should be considered. Local initiatives combined with
national policy and practice changes can lead to an
improvement in the outcomes for people with CKD regard-
less of the level of resources available.

Children with known or suspected CKD or who are at risk
of CKD (as outlined above) should be referred to specialist
care. This allows for timely investigations and diagnosis. Early
integration of children with CKD into nephrology services
will ensure optimal management of pediatric complications
of CKD (including growth restriction) and will promote ac-
cess to preemptive transplantation (the KRT of choice).

5.2 Symptoms in CKD
5.2.1 Prevalence and severity of symptoms
CKD confers a high burden of uremic symptoms that may be
under-recognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated.835 As
kidney disease progresses, affected people experience an
increasing burden of adverse uremic symptoms. These
symptoms can impair their health-related QoL (HRQoL) by
interfering with social relationships, ﬁnancial instability, and
contributing to overall poor well-being.836 Patient-reported
including HRQoL and symptoms, are often
outcomes,
identiﬁed by people with CKD as more important to them
than clinical outcomes, such as survival.837,838 A recent
systematic review of 126 patient-reported outcome studies
involving people with CKD G1–G5, not on KRT, identiﬁed the
most common symptoms experienced in terms of prevalence
and severity in this population (Figure 49).839 The most
prevalent symptom reported in the CKD population not
on KRT was fatigue at 70% (95% CI: 60%–79%), whereas in
the identiﬁed control population without CKD,
fatigue
prevalence was 34% (95% CI: 0%–70%). In terms of the
symptoms reported as the most severe, sexual dysfunction had
review also looked at
the highest
populations receiving dialysis and/or transplantation, allowing
for
comparison of prevalence and severity across
populations. This provides insight into symptoms that may be
attributable to changing or deteriorating kidney function and
may provide symptom targets for tracking in the care of
people with CKD, especially those with more advanced CKD,
such as CKD G5.

5.2.2 Identiﬁcation and assessment of symptoms

Practice Point 5.2.2.1: Ask people with progressive CKD
about uremic symptoms (e.g., reduced appetite, nausea, and
level of fatigue/lethargy) at each consultation using a stan-
dardized validated assessment of uremic symptoms tool.

The identiﬁcation and assessment of symptoms in people
with progressive CKD are important for highlighting changes
in clinical management,840 redirecting treatment
toward
patient-centered management, and may lead to discussion
about appropriate supportive care options.838 Effective 2-
way communication and shared decision-making should be
key principles between healthcare providers and the people
they treat, allowing them to work in partnership to identify
symptom burden, possible treatment strategies, and person-
centered solutions.835,839,841

In the past, it had been challenging to ﬁnd an accepted
standardized approach to assess and report outcomes for

developed have been for people on dialysis, with little vali-

for musculoskeletal pain.

Consider complementary
therapies such as
acupuncture.838,840,849

Use of an adapted World Health
Organization (WHO) Analgesic
Ladder that takes into account
pharmacokinetic data of analgesics
in CKD.850

Before starting opioids, healthcare
providers should assess risk of
substance abuse and obtain
informed consent after a discussion
around goals, expectations, risks,
and alternatives.

Topical analgesics may be
effective but used with caution
to avoid adverse events due to
systemic absorption. There are
no studies on long-term use of
any analgesics in people with
CKD; therefore, attention should
be paid to issues of efﬁcacy and
safety.

Melatonin851 and simple
sedatives852,853

Referral to a specialist pain
clinic or palliative/
supportive care clinic may
be beneﬁcial for those at risk
of aberrant behaviors,
adverse outcomes, or in
special circumstances such
as end of life.849

In different world regions, 11%–50% of adults and 20%–45%
of children with CKD have malnutrition characterized by pro-
tein energy wasting (PEW).872–874 In a European cohort of 1334
adults over the age of 65 years with CKD G4–G5, 25% were
found to have moderate malnutrition, and the risk was increased
with advancing age, female gender, and psychiatric disease.875
Malnutrition can happen at any stage of CKD and is associated
with a higher morbidity and mortality, loss of muscle mass,
and inﬂammation. It can also be associated with worse
outcomes with kidney transplant.874 The risk of PEW increases

is also inﬂuenced by comorbid
as CKD progresses but
conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and CVD.
PEW is thought to be driven by the damaging effect of uremic
toxins on appetite and chronic inﬂammation.873–875 Given the
impact on prognosis and QoL, nutritional assessment and
intervention (ideally by a renal dietitian or accredited nutrition
provider) using a validated assessment
should be
undertaken for people with CKD who present with frailty, age
>65 years, weight
loss, poor growth (pediatrics), poor
appetite, and all people with CKD G4 and G5 (Table 39876–878).

Validated malnutrition assessment tool

Attributes

7-Point Subjective Global
Assessment (SGA)876

Provides assessment points on weight change, dietary intake, digestive function, functional capacity,
and metabolic stress. A nutrition focused physical examination is also performed. This updated version
of the SGA is more sensitive to short-term nutrition changes. A score of 1–2 indicates severe malnutrition,
3–5 is mild malnutrition, and 6–7 indicates normal nutrition status.

Malnutrition-Inﬂammation Score877

Assesses malnutrition and inﬂammation using 10 parameters including dietary intake, anthropometric
measurements, laboratory indices, and functional capacity. The score ranges from 0 (normal) to
30 (severe malnutrition and inﬂammation).

Mini Nutrition Assessment878

Includes assessment of dietary intake, mobility, neuropsychology, and some anthropometric measurements,
including weight and calf circumference. A score of 12–14 points indicates normal nutrition status,
8–11 indicates at risk for malnutrition, and 0–7 points indicates malnutrition.

5.3 Team-based integrated care

Practice Point 5.3.1: Enable access to a patient-centered
multidisciplinary care team consisting of dietary coun-
seling, medication management, education, and counseling
about different KRT modalities, transplant options, dialysis
access surgery, and ethical, psychological, and social care
for people with CKD.

An optimal care model leads to the best outcomes for the
individual, the population, and the community. The model of
care varies according to CKD severity and risk of progression
to kidney failure, which will determine the target population
and goals (Figure 50).

CKD models of care follow the same principles embodied
in the chronic disease model of care (Figure 51879). Each key

should address 3 main issues:

standardized educational topics and resources,

(i)
(ii) strategy to provide education effectively, and
(iii) patient-centered concept.

to individual needs, circumstances, and resources, see text for
details.

Standardized educational

topics should cover 3 main
subject areas: knowledge about CKD, knowledge about
treatment to slow progression and complications of CKD, and
knowledge about the kidney failure management options.

Educational material should be written and explained
clearly with plain language. Customization of information to
patient needs and literacy level, and sensitive to cultural
norms and needs (i.e., storytelling/videos vs. written mate-
rials). A multidisciplinary approach should be encouraged as
an effective strategy for providing education. Engaging com-
munity healthcare workers and other health education

providers may be an effective strategy for providing patient/
carer education and empowering self-care management.883
Targeting education to people with CKD who are at high
risk of CKD progression might yield a better outcome than
routine care not only to the individual but also to the
healthcare
system. Engaging with family members or
caregivers in a CKD education program will facilitate self-
care management and psychosocial support.

Practice Point 5.3.3: Consider the use of telehealth tech-
nologies including web-based, mobile applications, virtual
visiting, and wearable devices in the delivery of education
and care.

Telehealth has been used increasingly in medicine,
including nephrology, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Telehealth has the potential to augment patient care in CKD
in many aspects such as improving access to CKD care in
increasing patient monitoring ability,
outreach patients,
helping with healthcare provider shortage, and improving
(“Tele-
patient
satisfaction. Telehealth in nephrology
nephrology”) can be categorized into 3 main areas: (i) remote
monitoring, (ii) providing education, and (iii) delivery of
care. These have been implemented in 4 main platforms
including internet web-based,
smartphone applications,
interactive video conferencing, and wearable technology.

Remote monitoring technology has been designed to
promote self-care management through oversight of clinical
parameters so people with CKD can monitor changes at
home, such as BP, body weight, or abnormal symptoms.884,885
This may encourage people with CKD to participate in the
management of CKD.

Telehealth technologies that enhance education in people
with CKD have been reported in various forms. Web-based
applications are probably the most popular platform used to
provide education for people with CKD and their families.886
Systematic reviews suggest that web-based CKD materials are
mostly adequate but not written at a suitable literacy level for
most people with CKD.887,888

Smart phone applications have been increasingly adopted
for patient education in CKD. Educational material can be
installed into smartphone applications as a tool for on-de-
mand knowledge. Moreover, smartphones applications that
provide self-care management support for people with CKD
were reported in a pilot study.889 The application targeted 4
key self-care management parameters: monitoring BP,
and
medication management,
tracking
video
conferencing can provide patient education simultaneously
with a virtual visit.890,891 This
strategy should not be
intended to replace the clinic visit but would be helpful for
dealing with any event
that happens between follow-up
face-to-face visits, such as follow-up of clinical symptoms
adjusting medication. Examples of

Lastly,

telehealth technologies that were studied in people with
CKD are shown in Figure 54.

Standardized and culturally appropriate protocols should
be considered. Although it is recognized that resources may
vary across and within jurisdictions, the recommendations
here are based on principles of care, which should be relevant
across the globe.

conditions. Therefore, models of care should be developed

environment. The principles of care are universal, but
implementation may be customized to speciﬁc circumstances.

Special considerations

Pediatric considerations.

5.3.1 Transition from pediatric to adult care
5.3.1.1 Pediatric providers

Practice Point 5.3.1.1.1: Prepare adolescents and their
families for transfer to adult-oriented care starting at 11–14
years of age by using checklists to assess readiness and
guide preparation, and by conducting part of each visit
without the parent/guardian present (Figure 55).

Practice Point 5.3.1.1.2: Provide a comprehensive written
transfer summary, and ideally an oral handover, to the
receiving healthcare providers including all relevant med-
ical information as well as information about the young
person’s cognitive abilities and social support (Figure 55).

Practice Point 5.3.1.1.3: Transfer young people to adult care
during times of medical and social stability where possible.
Although several organizations have made recommendations
about transition from pediatric to adult care, there have been no
randomized trials to test the effectiveness of speciﬁc ap-
proaches.892–894 Nevertheless, there is general agreement that
preparation for transfer to adult care should start as early as 11
years of age and certainly by 14 years when possible.895 A number
of tools are available to guide preparation. Checklists to assess

readiness (i.e., TRxANSITION, Youth Quiz from the On Trac
program, Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire
(TRAQ), Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ), and
Got Transition tools http://www.gottransition.org) are useful
to identify the areas of weakness.896–899 Young people should
gradually be prepared for full autonomy with medical visits.
Seeing the young person alone before inviting caregivers into
the room allows young people to practice interacting with
healthcare providers independently and provides privacy for
the discussion of sensitive topics.

Good communication between the

transferring and
receiving care teams is a cornerstone of successful transitions.
A comprehensive written medical summary must be provided;
a verbal handover is ideal. Because childhood CKD may be
associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities,
clear
description of the young person’s cognitive abilities, including
strengths and weaknesses that may inﬂuence their ability for
self-care management,
is critical. Information about social
support available to young people is also important.

a

Healthcare transitions are well known to be strongly
associated with adverse outcomes, including loss to follow-up.
Transferring during periods of instability is ill-advised and
may amplify the risk of poor outcomes.894 To minimize the
risk of loss to follow-up, pediatric care providers should
follow-up with patients to ensure that they have engaged
with the new care team.

Transition clinics may improve the outcomes of young
people transitioning from pediatric to adult care.900,901
Transition clinics may be staffed exclusively by pediatric
care providers and focus on preparation, or may be jointly
staffed by pediatric and adult providers.895,902 Although

5.3.1.2 Adult providers

Practice Point 5.3.1.2.1: Recognize that young people under
25 years of age with CKD are a unique population at high
risk for adverse outcomes at least in part due to physiologic
incomplete brain maturation.

Practice Point 5.3.1.2.2: Encourage young people to infor-
mally visit the adult care clinic to which they will be
transferred before the ﬁrst appointment (Figure 55).

Practice Point 5.3.1.2.3: Assess young people with CKD
more frequently than older people with the same stage of
CKD and, with the agreement of the young person, include
the caregivers or signiﬁcant other of the young person in
their care, at least in the ﬁrst 1–3 years following transfer
from pediatric care (Figure 55).

Even for young people without chronic illness, the interval
between 14 and 25 years of age is a period of change and
increasing autonomy. Young people with CKD undergoing
transfer to adult care must navigate 2 transitions simulta-
neously: the transition of care and the larger transition from
childhood to adulthood. Development of the prefrontal cor-
tex, responsible for planning, organization, and impulse
control, continues to approximately 25 years of age. Adult
care providers must recognize that young adults constitute a
high-risk population requiring special care.903 Outcomes are
poorer during this interval than at other times of life.904
Care must reﬂect the fact that this is a high-risk period.

An informal visit to the new clinic setting may help in
reducing stress, improving engagement, and reducing loss to
follow-up.895 In the initial years after transfer, visits should be
more frequent than for older adults with the same stage of
CKD to provide an opportunity for care providers to establish
a relationship with the young person, reduce the risk of loss to
improve adherence to medications, and provide
follow-up,

Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314

enhanced monitoring of a group at high risk of adverse
outcomes. Although young adults must have an opportunity
to meet their care providers alone, many will continue to
desire and need involvement of parents or signiﬁcant others in
their care. This is a normal part of development, is associated
with better outcomes, and should be encouraged.895

Multidisciplinary young adult clinics including youth
workers, social workers, pharmacists, and psychologists in
addition to physicians and nurses may be beneﬁcial.900 Peer-
support programs have also shown promise.904

5.4 Timing the initiation of dialysis

Practice Point 5.4.1: Initiate dialysis based on a composite
assessment of a person’s symptoms, signs, QoL, prefer-
ences, level of GFR, and laboratory abnormalities.

Practice Point 5.4.2: Initiate dialysis if the presence of one
or more of the following situations is evident (Table 41).
This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range
between 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

Practice Point 5.4.3: Consider planning for preemptive
kidney transplantation and/or dialysis access in adults
when the GFR is <15–20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or risk of
KRT is >40% over 2 years.

These statements are worded very precisely to highlight the
need to plan proactively for complex activities related to
initiation of KRT. Also, there is a need to address symptoms
and to avoid the institution of dialysis therapy at an arbitrary
number representing the degree of residual kidney function.
Given the risks and beneﬁts of KRT, as well as the potential
imprecision of measurements, people with CKD need to be
treated according to symptoms and signs, not simply based
on laboratory values. Data from the Initiating Dialysis Early
and Late (IDEAL) RCT show no survival advantage to early
start dialysis (i.e., at higher levels of GFR).905 Thus, the
statement as written should help the healthcare provider to
balance symptoms with laboratory values in decision-making.
Secondary analyses of the IDEAL study showed no signiﬁ-
cant difference in QoL or healthcare–related cost between early
and late start dialysis groups.905,906 Moreover, subgroup
analysis of the IDEAL study revealed no beneﬁts on cardiac
outcome in the early-start dialysis group.907 Since the IDEAL
study, there were a number of large sample size observational
studies with an advanced statistical
technique to reduce
possible confounding factors and biases encountered in
previous observational studies.908–910 The overall results were

Table 41 | Indications for the initiation of dialysis

consistent with the IDEAL study and showed no beneﬁts of
early-start dialysis compared with late-start dialysis in regard
to mortality and hospitalization risk (Table 42905–909).

Factors such as availability of resources, reasons for starting
dialysis, timing of dialysis initiation, patient education and
preparedness, dialysis modality and access, as well as varied
“country-speciﬁc” factors signiﬁcantly affect a person’s expe-
riences and outcomes. As the burden of kidney failure
has increased globally, there has also been a growing recogni-
tion of the importance of patient involvement in determining
the goals of care and decisions regarding treatment. It is
important to move away from a “one-size-ﬁts-all” approach to
dialysis and provide more individualized or personalized care.
The availability of resources for formal multidisciplinary
teams, educational materials, and access to specialized counseling
for diet, advance directives, access planning, and preemptive
transplantation varies around the world. These statements are
proposed so that “best practices” can be documented or aspired
to. The need for education, planning, and appropriate expertise
for the management of this patient group is internationally
relevant. The methods, frequency, and tools with which this can
be accomplished will be region speciﬁc.

There is a need to focus on regular symptom assessment as
part of the CKD review in those with lower eGFR values.
Individual assessment and availability of resources will dictate
speciﬁc timing of therapies. Healthcare providers should be
aware of the impact of early dialysis start on QoL before
recommending this strategy to people with CKD.

Recognition that the planning of smooth transition to
either dialysis or transplantation from advanced CKD re-
quires alignment of multiple different resources and activities,
as such the planning for these will be situation speciﬁc. It is
important to recognize that there is variability in the avail-
ability of vascular access services or peritoneal dialysis cath-
those who choose hemodialysis or
eter
peritoneal dialysis, respectively, and access to preemptive
transplantation. The complexity of the decision-making and
different teams and resources required to effectively transition

begin “planning of KRT” is intentionally advised at a con-

Practice Point 5.4.5: Pursue living or deceased donor pre-
emptive kidney transplantation as the treatment of choice
for children in whom there is evidence of progressive and
irreversible CKD. The eGFR at which preemptive trans-
plantation should be undertaken will depend on multiple
factors including the age and size of the child and the rate
of progression of kidney failure but will usually be between
eGFR 5–15 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

In children, poor growth can also be a reason to initiate
dialysis. The decision to start dialysis should be reached in
discussion with the child (if age appropriate), their caregivers,
and their healthcare providers. Medical and psychosocial
preparations for the initiation of dialysis should begin well
before dialysis is required.

Deferred initiation should not imply deferred preparation,

In children, studies from the USRDS, the European Society

no beneﬁt from starting dialysis early.911–913 Of 15,000 inci-
dent children on dialysis in the USRDS, the mortality risk was
36% higher for those with eGFR >10 ml/min per 1.73 m2
compared with those with lower eGFR at dialysis initiation.912
Mortality risk increased in those starting dialysis with eGFR
<5 and $12 ml/min per 1.73 m2, with a greater risk in
people 6 years and older.914 A retrospective ESPN study of
nearly 3000 children found that mortality did not differ
when dialysis was started with an eGFR above or below 8
ml/min per 1.73 m2.911 These observational data may be
confounded by indication bias.

5.5 Structure and process of supportive care and
comprehensive conservative management

Practice Point 5.5.1: Inform people with CKD about the
options for KRT and comprehensive conservative care.

Practice Point 5.5.2: Support comprehensive conservative
management as an option for people who choose not to
pursue KRT.

Practice Point 5.5.3: Provide access to resources that enable
the delivery of advanced care planning for people with a
recognized need for end-of-life care, including those people
undergoing comprehensive conservative care.

intended to prolong life,

These statements are intended to highlight the importance
of supportive care and the need for comprehensive conser-
vative care processes and resources in the care of this complex
patient group. The term supportive care in nephrology means
care that is focused on improving the HRQoL for people with
CKD at any severity or age and can be provided along with
such as dialysis.838
therapies
Although typically considered in people with advanced
kidney disease, supportive care may be applicable to people
in earlier CKD stages. Whereas comprehensive conservative
management
is usually referred to as active medical
management in people with kidney failure who choose not
to have KRT. There are 3 distinct groups of people with
kidney failure who receive comprehensive conservative care
because provision of supportive care differs for each.915
Descriptions of each group are shown in Table 43.

There is increasing recognition that provision of organized
care to those who are dying or choose to not pursue KRT is of
value to people with CKD and their families. Healthcare
providers involved in caring for these people should be aler-
ted to this need.

Comprehensive conservative care is an alternative treat-
ment to KRT. This is planned, holistic, person-centered care
that includes the full integration of comprehensive conser-
vative care including the following:
(cid:3) Detailed communication including estimating prognosis

and advance care planning

(cid:3) Shared decision-making
(cid:3) Active symptom assessment and management
(cid:3) Psychological, social, family, cultural, and spiritual support

(cid:3) Interventions to delay progression and minimize risks
including

of adverse events or complications, but not
dialysis.
Evaluating the prognosis of each person with CKD is very
important because each person has a different disease pro-
gression pattern. Patient prognosis is the key information for
shared decision-making in CKD G5, which requires unbiased
information on survival and person-centered outcomes
known to matter to people with CKD: QoL, symptom
burden, and support from family and healthcare providers.
Shared decision-making helps healthcare providers, people
with CKD, and family members to reach agreement on the
treatment direction that is appropriate with the person’s
values and preferences and family goals. This process should
be performed in a culturally appropriate way with consider-
ation of appropriate health literacy.

selecting treatment

As CKD progresses, the person with CKD will experi-
ence more symptoms and complications related to CKD.
Therefore, active symptom assessment and management
are the key components of comprehensive conservative
care in CKD G5. Assessing a person’s symptoms on a
regular basis helps redirect management toward a person’s
values and preferences and family goals. There is limited
evidence for
strategies due to the
complexity of CKD and differences in people and the
considerable variation in the management strategies for
different symptoms. Intervention to delay progression of
CKD is still an important component of comprehensive
conservative care in both CKD-related aspects (maintain
cardiovascular
residual
morbidity) and psychospiritual aspects (the person and
their family members do not feel that active CKD treat-
ment is discontinued).

reduce

Advanced care planning (ACP) is a process under the
comprehensive conservative care umbrella that involves un-
derstanding, communication, and discussion between a per-
son with CKD, the family, caregiver, and healthcare providers
for the purpose of clarifying preferences for end-of-life care.
End-of-life care is the treatment during the phase where death
is inevitable. It focuses on QoL not quantity of lifetime.
Functional and cognitive decline that may happen along with
CKD progression results in difﬁcult end-of-life conversations
involving people with CKD, families, and healthcare pro-
viders. Therefore, an integrated approach to timely ACP and

Figure 56 | Relationship between supportive care, comprehensive conservative care, and end-of-life care. Kidney supportive care
emphasizes efforts to optimize quality of life and relieve suffering in people with kidney disease. This emphasis should be present for people
undergoing comprehensive conservative care, as well as those who transition to end-of-life care. CKD, chronic kidney disease

palliative care spanning the continuum of CKD care is
needed. End-of-life care is underused in the management of
people with CKD G5 due to inadequate education during
nephrology training leading to poor end-of-life care discus-
sions with the person. The overall concept of supportive care,
comprehensive conservative care, and end-of-life care is
shown in Figure 56.

In different societies or cultural areas,

the form and
structure of this care may vary tremendously, and families
or religious organizations may be able to deliver suitable
and sensitive care. The details here are listed not to be

prescriptive but rather to articulate the best practices in
communities where resources may be available and to serve
as a construct to review in those locations where resources
are more limited.

ACP is thought to be a component of all comprehensive
chronic disease management. Thus, ACP discussions are not
restricted only to those choosing supportive care.

Chapter 6: Research recommendations

The last 30 years have seen an exponential growth in the
literature relating to kidney disease. However, despite this
inclusion of people with CKD in prospective RCTs, those with
lower GFR remain under-represented. Before the KDIGO
2012 CKD guideline, a low eGFR was an exclusion criterion
for almost every large cardiovascular and BP trial. As a result,
we had a largely opinion-based literature. That is changing,
and although still
low, the proportion of the total CKD
literature that is either an RCT, meta-analysis, or systematic
review has doubled from 3.3% to 6.5% of published articles
in the 5-year period ending December 2022.
large international

interventional studies have
been completed in the last 8 years, either speciﬁcally tar-
geting people with CKD and other comorbidities (most
notably diabetes or CVD), or with CKD deﬁned by eGFR
and ACR criteria (e.g., Canagliﬂozin and Renal Endpoints in
Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation
[CREDENCE],514
EMPA-KIDNEY,403
DAPA-CKD,513
FIGARO-DKD,534 and FIDELIO-DKD533). Interventional

are
increasing as well, though limited in scale due to rarity of

and diseases

targeting

Several

There remain gaps in the evidence base to inform best
diagnostic testing strategies, decision-making, and processes
of care. In addition, some therapies offering promise have not
yet been adequately tested in people deﬁned by speciﬁc
criteria with CKD (i.e., people without diabetes, children,
women, PKD, frail, elderly, etc.) and people from low-income
and low-middle-income countries. We, therefore, begin this
section detailing research recommendations with some gen-
eral guiding principles for those designing studies to consider
when addressing key questions that impact people living with
or at risk for CKD.

Guiding principles for research

1. To ensure that the evidence base is directly applicable to
all people with CKD, future studies should avoid auto-
matic exclusion of older people, children, and young
adults <18 years old, and give consideration to pregnant
and lactating people. The need for contraceptive re-
quirements for trial participation should also be reviewed.
2. Decreased GFR should not be a reason for automatic

exclusion from research studies.

3. Estimating equations equally applicable to those with and
without CKD are required for children and adolescents.

4. For new equations predicting CVD and mortality
risk as well as CKD progression, development and
implementation studies including validation in different
populations
are
required.

demographic)

(geographic

and

5. Beneﬁt-risk ratio assessments of old, new, and future
medications should be performed by levels of GFR and
ACR and/or using validated risk equations.

6. Drug

studies

evaluating pharmacodynamics

should
consider using validated eGFR equations or mGFR for
highly toxic drugs with a narrow therapeutic window,
especially for those frequently used in CKD. As this may
be prohibitively expensive for some medications, epide-
miologic studies may provide information for revisions to
labels for some drugs.

7. Pharmacokinetic studies in people with CKD should not

automatically exclude GFR categories G4 and G5.

8. Studies should consider measurement of ACR in all co-
horts, whether speciﬁcally focused on CKD or not, given
additional prognostic value of this parameter for so many
outcomes.

9. All studies should ensure attention to etiology of CKD,
sex, gender, age, and SES considerations in design and
analysis of results.

10. Use of novel study designs (platform, registry-embedded,
and pragmatic trials), use of large administrative datasets,
and implementation science methodologies (e.g., causal
inference techniques) should be considered to enable the
assessment and evaluation of interventions, processes, and
models of care.

11. People living with CKD should be involved in clinical
studies throughout the research process from identiﬁca-
tion of knowledge gaps to knowledge mobilization and
study design.
The following set of more speciﬁc research recommenda-
tions are organized according to chapter and are not
exhaustive. They are generated in part from identifying gaps
in knowledge during the evidence review and in part from
clinical practice and patient perspectives.

CKD in targeted populations in the community setting will
reduce the incidence of CVD and CKD progression to
kidney failure through earlier intervention of disease-
modifying strategies.

tions may achieve levels of accuracy approaching
that of mGFR.

B Assess the non-GFR determinants of endogenous

ﬁltration markers such as cystatin C.

B Assess the utility of changes in eGFRcr versus
eGFRcys versus eGFRcr-cys over time for clinical
decision-making, enrollment into clinical trials,
and so on.

B Examine the effect of sex hormone status (e.g., pu-
berty, gonadectomy, or menopause), exogenous
hormone use (e.g., contraception, assisted repro-
ductive technologies, menopausal hormone therapy,
testosterone replacement therapy, or gender-afﬁrm-
ing hormone therapy), or sex hormone deprivation
therapy (e.g., antiandrogen or antiestrogen therapy)
on serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C and their
corresponding GFR estimates and mGFR.

B Evaluate the accuracy of the CKiD U25 2021 eGFRcr

in people with CKD:
Improving the accuracy of risk assessment and demon-
strating utility and usefulness of validated risk assessment
tools in clinical practice are critical to uptake.
(cid:3) Determine whether persons who have a >30% decline in
eGFR while using RASi, SGLT2i, and MRAs have better out-
comes if they continue versus discontinue these medications.
(cid:3) Determine the clinical importance/meaning of divergence of
eGFRcys and eGFRcr in clinical practice, and whether the
divergence magnitude and/or direction varies by demography.
(cid:3) Evaluate the clinical and cost utilities of equations guiding
clinical decision-making in people with CKD including
children and young people, for individual people, clini-
cians, and the healthcare system.

(cid:3) Develop implementation strategies and evaluation frame-
works to enable assessment of the potential barriers and
facilitators of validated equations for CKD populations,
including the new equations for CVD and mortality out-
comes as well as for proximal CKD progression.

(cid:3) Risk scores derived from validated equations should be tested
as both inclusion criteria for enrichment of study cohorts as
well as potential surrogate endpoints in clinical trials.

(cid:3) Evaluate the difference in performance characteristics of
validated risk equations for eGFR using endogenous ﬁltration
markers such as cystatin C, creatinine, or both (eGFRcys,
eGFRcr, and eGFRcr-cys) for kidney failure, cardiovascular
events, and all-cause mortality, and pregnancy and fetal out-
comes in a variety of populations (i.e., age, sex, and region).

Chapter 3. Delaying CKD progression and managing its
complications: There is a paucity of well-designed studies
evaluating combination therapies and nutritional strategies
in different populations with CKD and evaluating speciﬁc
target values for interventions in laboratory abnormalities,
which generates uncertainty and confusion for both clini-
cians and patients.
(cid:3) Generate more evidence on the effect of nutritional thera-
pies (e.g., varying levels of protein restriction with and
without supplementation [e.g., ketoanalogs]) documenting
beneﬁts (e.g., delaying progression) versus potential harms
(e.g., patient intolerance and malnutrition).

(cid:3) Evaluate different nutrition regimens in larger, longer-term
RCTs than those performed to date using pragmatic designs
to enable generalizability.

(cid:3) Evaluate the effects of plant-based protein diets and diets such
as the Mediterranean, Okinawan, and DASH diets versus
animal-based protein diets on risk of CKD progression,
metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperkalemia.

(cid:3) Evaluate the beneﬁt-risk ratio and impact on QoL of dietary
restriction (i.e., protein restriction vs. no protein restric-
tion) in people with CKD receiving optimal medical ther-
apy (e.g., ACEi/SGLT2i/ns-MRA).

B Does this vary by age, sex, ACR, initial eGFR, and

etiology of CKD?

optimal medical therapy in prevention of progression of
CKD in people with CKD, including a range of baseline
BPs, ages, sex, and etiology of CKD.

population subgroups understudied in completed large
RCTs (e.g., people with PKD and T1D, children, young or
older adults, transgender, gender-diverse and nonbinary
people, and women at different ages/hormonal status
including pregnancy and lactation).

(cid:3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies to prevent the
progression of CKD in people with relatively low (e.g.,
<5%) risk of kidney failure within 5 years, by etiology, age,
sex, and gender.

biomarkers predict outcomes in people with CKD without
diabetes and with lower ACR <30 mg/g (<3 mg/mmol).
(cid:3) Determine the safety and efﬁcacy of SGLT2i for prevention of
progression of CKD in children and young adults with CKD.

Commissioning of Work Group and ERT. KDIGO and the
Co-Chairs assembled and engaged a Work Group with
expertise in pediatric, adult, and geriatric nephrology,
including both dialysis and transplant specialists; primary
care; internal medicine; dietetics; nursing; women’s health;
clinical trials; epidemiology; medical decision-making; and
public health; as well as people living with CKD. Johns
Hopkins University, with expertise in nephrology, evidence
synthesis, and guideline development, was contracted as the
ERT and was tasked with conducting the evidence reviews.
The ERT coordinated the methodological and analytical
including literature
processes of guideline development,

searching, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, evidence
synthesis and meta-analysis, grading the certainty of the evi-
dence per critical outcome, and grading the overall certainty
of the evidence for the recommendations. The Work Group
was responsible for writing the recommendations and the
underlying rationale, grading the strength of the recom-
mendations, and developing practice points.

Deﬁning scope and topics and formulating key clinical ques-
tions. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was reviewed by the
Co-Chairs to identify topics to be included in the 2024
guideline. Scoping reviews of these topics were conducted by
the ERT to provide an overview of the available evidence base
and to identify existing relevant systematic reviews.

The Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was
used to assess the risk of bias of the existing reviews. When
high-quality systematic reviews were identiﬁed during the
scoping reviews, the ERT conducted an updated search based
on the existing review and extracted information from the
newly identiﬁed studies. This information was added to the
existing review data and analyzed as appropriate.

For topics that did not map to current high-quality re-
views, de novo systematic reviews were undertaken. Protocols
for each review were developed by the ERT and reviewed by
the Work Group. Protocols were registered on PROSPERO
(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/). Systematic reviews
were conducted in accordance with current
standards,
including those from the Cochrane Handbook.919
the Population,

Intervention, Comparator,
Outcome and Study design (PICOS) of the questions are pro-
vided in Table 44.23,316,318,415,511,609,920–926 Information about
existing reviews that were used is included in these tables.

Details of

For some topics not predeﬁned in the Scope of Work, the
ERT extracted the certainty of evidence from existing high-
quality systematic reviews, as available. Details of the PICOS
for these questions are also provided in Table 44.

Literature searches and article selection. Searches for RCTs
were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), and
searches for diagnosis/prognosis studies were conducted on
PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. For topics with available
existing reviews, the review was used and an updated search
was conducted. The search strategies are provided in
Appendix A: Supplementary Table S1.

To improve efﬁciency and accuracy in the title/abstract
screening process and to manage the process, search results
were uploaded to a web-based screening tool, PICO Portal
(www.picoportal.net). PICO Portal uses machine learning to
sort and present those citations most likely to be promoted to
full-text screening ﬁrst. The titles and abstracts resulting from

the searches were initially screened independently by 2
members of the ERT. One screener was used when the recall
rate of citations promoted to full-text screening reached at
least 90% and then title and abstract screening was stopped
when the recall rate of citations promoted to full-text was at
least 95%. Citations deemed potentially eligible at the title
and abstract stage were screened independently by 2 ERT
members at the full-text level. At both title/abstract and full-
text screening disagreements about eligibility were resolved by
consensus, and, as necessary through discussion among the
ERT members.

Supplementary Figures S1–S12 include PRISMA diagrams
for each systematic review.

A total of 30,861 citations were screened. Of these, 145
RCTs and 232 nonrandomized studies were included in the
evidence review (Figure 57).

Data extraction. Data extraction, from studies and existing
systematic reviews, was performed by a member of the ERT
and conﬁrmed by a second member of the ERT. Any differ-
ences among members of the ERT were resolved through
discussion. A third reviewer was included if consensus could
not be achieved.

included RCTs. For these reviews, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2
tool was used to assess risk of bias for RCTs based on the
randomization process, deviations from the intended in-
terventions, missing outcome data, measurement of
the
outcome, and selection of the reported results.927

The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies
(QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess study limitations of
diagnostic studies based on the following items928:
(cid:3) Could the selection of patients have introduced bias (pa-

tient selection)?

(cid:3) Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have

introduced bias (index test)?

(cid:3) Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpre-

tation have introduced bias (reference standard)?

(cid:3) Could the patient ﬂow have introduced bias (ﬂow and timing)?
(cid:3) Applicability

(cid:3) Are there concerns that the included patients and

setting do not match the review question?

(cid:3) Are there concerns that the index test, its conduct,
or interpretation differ from the review question?
(cid:3) Are there concerns that the target condition as
deﬁned by the reference standard does not match
the question?

The ROBIS tool was used to assess risk of bias in sys-
tematic reviews based on study eligibility criteria, identiﬁca-
tion and selection of studies, data collection and study
appraisal, and overall risk of bias.929

All risk-of-bias assessments were conducted independently
by 2 members of the ERT, with disagreements resolved by
internal discussion and consultation with a third ERT mem-
ber, as needed.

Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Measures of treatment
effect. For dichotomous outcomes, a pooled effect estimate
was calculated as the RR between the trial arms of RCTs, with
each study weighted by the inverse variance, using a random-
effects model with the DerSimonian and Laird formula for
continuous
calculating
outcomes, a standardized mean difference was calculated by
using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian and
Laird formula.930

between-study

variance.930

For

Data synthesis. Meta-analysis was conducted if there were 2
or more studies that were sufﬁciently similar with respect to
key variables (population characteristics, study duration, and
comparisons).

We combined studies of interventions in the same class
when reporting outcomes. If there was substantial heteroge-
neity (I2 >50%) in pooled estimates for any outcome, we
stratiﬁed by the type of intervention before conducting the
pooled analyses.

Pooled sensitivity and speciﬁcity was calculated using a
random-effects model in studies addressing biopsy diagnosis
and prognosis using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine
transformation to calculate the pooled estimate.931 The
binomial exact method to calculate the CIs was used.932

graded recommendations, the statements were retained as
graded recommendations; graded recommendations were
updated where appropriate based on new evidence; existing

Policy

Most people in your situation would want
the recommended course of action, and
only a small proportion would not.

Most patients should receive the
recommended course of action.

The recommendation can be evaluated
as a candidate for developing a policy
or a performance measure.

Level 2
“We suggest”

The majority of people in your situation
would want the recommended course
of action, but many would not.

Different choices will be appropriate for
different patients. Each patient needs
help to arrive at a management
decision consistent with their values
and preferences.

The recommendation is likely to require
substantial debate and involvement of
stakeholders before policy can be
determined.

KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes.

Grading the strength of the recommendations. The strength
of a recommendation was graded by the Work Group as Level
1 or Level 2 (Table 47). The strength of a recommendation was
determined by the balance of beneﬁts and harms across all
critical and important outcomes, the grading of the overall
certainty of
the evidence, patient values and preferences,
resource use and costs, and other considerations (Table 48).

Balance of beneﬁts and harms. The Work Group determined
the anticipated net health beneﬁt on the basis of expected
beneﬁts and harms across all critical outcomes from the
underlying evidence review.

The overall certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of
the evidence for each recommendation is determined by the
certainty of evidence for critical outcomes. In general, the
overall certainty of evidence is dictated by the critical
outcome with the lowest certainty of evidence.936 This could
be modiﬁed based on the relative importance of each
outcome to the population of interest. The overall certainty
of the evidence was graded high (A), moderate (B),
low
(C), or very low (D) (Table 46).

Patient values and preferences. The Work Group included 2
people living with CKD. These members’ unique perspectives
and lived experience, in addition to the Work Group under-
standing of patient preferences and priorities, informed de-
cisions about
the recommendations. A
systematic review of qualitative studies on patient priorities
and preferences was not undertaken for this guideline.

Practice points. In addition to graded recommendations,
KDIGO guidelines now include “practice points” to help
healthcare providers better evaluate and implement the guid-
ance from the expert Work Group. Practice points are consensus
statements about a speciﬁc aspect of care and supplement rec-
ommendations. These were developed when no formal sys-
tematic evidence review was undertaken or
there was
insufﬁcient evidence to provide a graded recommendation.
Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guideline
Work Group, and they may be based on limited evidence.
Practice points were sometimes formatted as a table, a ﬁgure, or
an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice.

Format

for guideline recommendations. Each guideline
recommendation provides an assessment of the strength of
the recommendation (Level 1, “we recommend” or Level 2,
“we suggest”) and the overall certainty of the evidence (A, B,
C, D). The recommendation statements are followed by Key
information (Balance of beneﬁts and harms, Certainty of the
evidence, Values and preferences, Resource use and costs,
Considerations for implementation), and Rationale. Each
recommendation is linked to relevant SoF tables. An under-
lying rationale may also support a practice point.

Table 48 | Determinants of the strength of recommendation

Factors

Balance of beneﬁts and harms

The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the more likely a strong recommendation
is provided. The narrower the gradient, the more likely a weak recommendation is warranted.

Comment

Certainty of the evidence

The higher the certainty of evidence, the more likely a strong recommendation is warranted. However, there are
exceptions for which low- or very low-certainty evidence will warrant a strong recommendation.

Values and preferences

The more variability or the more uncertainty in values and preferences, the more likely a weak recommendation is
warranted. Values and preferences were obtained from the literature, where possible, or were assessed by the
judgment of the Work Group, when robust evidence was not identiﬁed.

Resources and other costs

The higher the costs of an intervention—that is, the more resources consumed—the less likely a strong
recommendation is warranted.

Limitations of the guideline development process. Two peo-
ple living with diabetes and CKD were members of the Work
Group and provided invaluable perspectives and lived expe-
riences for the development of these guidelines. However, in
the development of these guidelines, no scoping exercise with

the qualitative literature, or formal
patients, searches of
qualitative evidence synthesis examining patient experiences
and priorities were undertaken. As noted, although resource
implications were considered in the formulation of recom-
mendations, no economic evaluations were undertaken.

Guy Hill was diagnosed with IgAN
in 1996 at the age of 35 and was in
kidney failure within 2 years. After a
2-year period of peritoneal dialysis,
he had a transplant in 2001. This
lasted until 2008 and then he did 4
years of home hemodialysis before a
further transplant in 2012 that failed
to work for a further 9 months. Once
awake, this transplant lasted until 2016 and then followed a
further 4 years of home hemodialysis, which ended with a live
transplant from his brother in 2019, which is working suc-
cessfully today.

He has taken an active interest in patient advocacy and
support since 1999, mainly locally with his Manchester Kid-
ney Patient Association of which he is chair. He is also on the
Patient Advisory Group for the National Kidney Charity,
Kidney Care UK. He has also been patient representative on
several NICE assessments of new devices and drugs for people
with CKD.

He has attended a full range of kidney conferences and
professional discussion groups at a local, regional, and na-
tional level on health service organizations that affect kidney
patients.

His contact with many patients and professionals from all
areas of the kidney service has given him a broad knowledge
of all stages of kidney care and its challenges.

Acknowledgments

A special debt of gratitude is owed to the KDIGO Co-Chairs,
Morgan Grams and Michel Jadoul, and immediate past Co-
Chair Wolfgang Winkelmayer, for their invaluable oversight
throughout the development of this guideline. In particular,
we thank Karen Robinson, Lisa Wilson, Renee Wilson, Dipal
Patel, and the ERT members for their substantial contribution
to the rigorous assessment of the available evidence. We
acknowledge Bertram Kasiske and Marcello Tonelli for their
guidance on strengthening the linkage between the recom-
mendations and evidence base and for striving to improve on
the format to better meet the KDIGO aspiration for a “living
guideline” that is consistently kept up to date, and above all,
useful and informative to practicing healthcare providers. We
also would like to acknowledge Debbie Maizels for her vital
contributions to the artwork presented in this guideline.

We are especially grateful to the Work Group members for
their expertise throughout the entire process of literature
review, data extraction, meeting participation, and the critical
writing and editing of the statements and rationale, which
made the publication of this guideline possible. The generous
gift of their time and dedication is greatly appreciated. Finally,
on behalf of the Work Group, we gratefully acknowledge the
careful assessment of the draft guideline by public external
reviewers. The Work Group considered all of the valuable
comments made, and where appropriate, suggested changes
were incorporated into the ﬁnal publication. The following
