The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” in-
cludes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to
provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guide-
lines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional
Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for
updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a
detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the
evidence-grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full
list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction
and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are
invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

ASSESSMENT OF GLYCEMIC STATUS
Glycemic status is assessed by A1C measurement, blood glucose monitoring (BGM)
by capillary (ﬁnger-stick) devices, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using
time in range (TIR) or mean CGM glucose. Clinical trials of interventions that lower
A1C have demonstrated the beneﬁts of improved glycemia. Glucose monitoring via
CGM or BGM (discussed in detail in Section 7, “Diabetes Technology”) is useful for
diabetes self-management, can provide nuanced information on glucose responses
to meals, physical activity, and medication changes, and may be particularly useful
in individuals taking insulin. CGM serves an increasingly important role in optimiz-
ing the effectiveness and safety of treatment in many people with type 1 diabetes,
type 2 diabetes, or other forms of diabetes (e.g., cystic ﬁbrosis–related diabetes).
Individuals on a variety of insulin treatment plans can beneﬁt from CGM with im-
proved glucose levels, decreased hypoglycemia, and enhanced self-efﬁcacy (Section 7,
“Diabetes Technology”) (1).

Glycemic Assessment

Recommendations
6.1 Assess glycemic status by A1C A and/or continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) metrics such as time in range, time above range, and time below range.
B Fructosamine or CGM can be used for glycemic monitoring when an alterna-
tive to A1C is required. B
6.2 Assess glycemic status at least two times a year, and more frequently (e.g.,
every 3 months) for individuals not meeting glycemic goals or with recent treat-
ment changes, frequent or severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or changes in
health status, or during periods of rapid growth and development in youth. E

Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia

S129

Glycemic Assessment by A1C
The A1C test is the primary tool for assess-
ing glycemic status in both clinical practice
and clinical trials, and it is strongly linked
to diabetes complications (2–4). A1C
reﬂects average glycemia over approxi-
mately 2–3 months. The performance
of laboratory tests for A1C is generally
excellent for National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP)–certiﬁed
assays (ngsp.org). Thus, A1C testing should
be performed routinely in all people with
diabetes at initial assessment and as part
of continuing care. Measurement ap-
proximately every 3 months determines
whether glycemic goals have been
reached and maintained. Adults with
type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have
achieved and are maintaining glucose
levels within their target range may
only need A1C testing or other glucose
assessments twice a year. Individuals
with less stable glucose levels, those
with intensive care plans, or those not meet-
ing their treatment goals may require more
frequent testing, typically every 3 months,
with additional assessments as needed. Poin-
t-of-care A1C testing can offer timely oppor-
tunities for treatment adjustments during
appointments with health care professionals.
The A1C test is an indirect measure of
average glycemia. Factors that affect he-
moglobin or red blood cells may affect
A1C. For example, conditions that affect
red blood cell turnover (hemolytic anemia
and other anemias, glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deﬁciency, recent blood
transfusion, use of drugs that stimulate
erythropoiesis, end-stage kidney disease,
and pregnancy) can interfere with the ac-
curacy of A1C (5). Some hemoglobin var-
iants can interfere with some A1C assays;
however, most assays in use in the U.S.
are accurate in individuals who are het-
erozygous for the most common variants
(6). A1C cannot be measured in individu-
als with sickle cell disease (HbSS) or other
homozygous hemoglobin variants (e.g.,
HbEE), since these individuals lack HbA
(7).
In individuals with conditions that
interfere with the interpretation of A1C,
alternative approaches to monitoring gly-
including
cemic status should be used,
self-monitoring of blood glucose, CGM,
and/or the use of glycated serum protein
assays (discussed below). A1C does not
provide a measure of glycemic variability
or hypoglycemia. For individuals prone to
glycemic variability, especially people with
type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with

insulin deﬁciency and/or treatment with
intensive insulin therapy, glycemic status
is best evaluated by the combination of
results from BGM or CGM and A1C. Dis-
cordant results between A1C and BGM or
CGM can occur due to high glycemic vari-
ability, inaccurate BGM or CGM measure-
ment, or inaccurate A1C due to the factors
discussed above.

As discussed in Section 2, “Diagnosis
and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes,” there is
controversy regarding the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of differences in A1C by self-
reported race and ethnicity (8–11). There
is an emerging understanding of genetic
determinants that may modify the associ-
ation between A1C and glucose levels
(12). However, race and ethnicity are not
good proxies for these genetic differences
that are likely present in a small minority
of individuals of all racial groups. There-
fore, race and ethnicity should not be con-
siderations for how A1C is used clinically for
glycemic monitoring. Limitations of labora-
tory tests and within-person variability in
glucose and A1C underscore the importance
of using multiple approaches to glycemic
monitoring and further evaluation of discor-
dant results in all racial or ethnic groups.

Serum Glycated Protein Assays as
Alternatives to A1C
Fructosamine and glycated albumin are
alternative measures of glycemia that
are approved for clinical use for monitor-
ing glycemic status in people with diabe-
tes. Fructosamine reﬂects total glycated
serum proteins (mostly albumin). Gly-
cated albumin assays reﬂect the propor-
tion of total albumin that is glycated. Due
to the turnover rate of serum protein,
fructosamine and glycated albumin re-
ﬂect glycemia over the past 2–4 weeks, a
shorter-term time frame than that of
A1C. Fructosamine and glycated albumin
are highly correlated in people with dia-
betes, and the performance of modern
assays is typically excellent. Fructosamine
and glycated albumin have been linked
to long-term complications in epidemio-
logic cohort studies (13–17). However,
there have been few clinical trials, and
the evidence base supporting the use of
these biomarkers to monitor glycemic
status is much weaker than that for A1C.
In people with diabetes who have condi-
tions where the interpretation of A1C
may be problematic or when A1C cannot
be measured (e.g., homozygous hemo-
globin variants), fructosamine or glycated

albumin may be useful alternatives to
monitor glycemic status (7).

Correlation Between A1C and Blood
Glucose Monitoring and Continuous
Glucose Monitoring
Table 6.1 provides rough equivalents of
A1C and mean glucose levels based on
data from the international A1C-Derived
Average Glucose (ADAG) study. The ADAG
study assessed the correlation between
A1C and frequent BGM and CGM in 507
adults (83% non-Hispanic White) with
type 1, type 2, and no diabetes (18,19).
The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
and the American Association for Clinical
Chemistry have determined that the cor-
relation (r = 0.92) in the ADAG trial is
strong enough to justify reporting both
the A1C result and the estimated average
glucose (eAG) result when a clinician or-
ders the A1C test. Clinicians should note
that the mean plasma glucose numbers
in Table 6.1 are based on (cid:1)2,700 read-
ings per A1C measurement in the ADAG
trial.

Caveats in interpretation of Table 6.1
include that these data are from a single
study published in 2008. Mean glucose in
the ADAG study was calculated from a
combination of measurements from an
early CGM system and capillary glucose,
intermittently, during a 3-month period.
This older system required calibration sev-
eral times a day using a self-monitoring

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

glucose meter. It is unclear how gener-
alizable these estimates are to mean
glucose measurements obtained using
modern CGM systems. The comparability
of A1C and mean glucose from CGM sys-
tems will depend on the number of days
of CGM wear, timing of the A1C mea-
surement relative to the CGM wear pe-
riod, calibration and accuracy of the CGM
system, lag time between interstitial glu-
cose and venous glucose, and any factors
that affect A1C or red cell turnover (see
Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of
Diabetes”).

Glycemic Assessment by Blood
Glucose Monitoring
For many people with diabetes, glucose
monitoring, either using BGM by capillary
(ﬁnger-stick) devices or CGM in addition
to regular A1C testing, is key for achieving
glycemic goals. Major clinical trials of
insulin-treated individuals have included
BGM as part of multifactorial interven-
tions to demonstrate the beneﬁt of inten-
sive glycemic management on diabetes
complications (20). BGM is thus an inte-
gral component of effective therapy for
individuals taking insulin. In recent years,
CGM has become a standard method for
glucose monitoring for most people with
type 1 diabetes. Both approaches to glu-
cose monitoring allow people with diabe-
tes to evaluate individual responses to
therapy and assess whether glycemic goals
are being safely achieved. The speciﬁc
needs and goals of individuals with dia-
betes should dictate BGM frequency and
timing. Please refer to Section 7, “Diabetes
Technology,” for a more complete discus-
sion of the use of BGM and CGM.

Glycemic Assessment by Continuous
Glucose Monitoring
CGM is particularly useful in people with
diabetes who are at risk for hypoglycemia
and is commonly used in people with
type 1 diabetes (20). Use of CGM in type 2
diabetes (as well as in several other forms
of diabetes) is growing, especially in peo-
ple who are taking insulin. TIR is a useful
metric of glycemic status. A 10- to 14-day
CGM assessment of TIR, with CGM wear
of 70% or higher, and other CGM metrics
can be used to assess glycemic status and
are useful in clinical management (21–25).
TIR, and especially mean CGM glucose,
correlates with A1C (26–30). Time below

range (<70 and <54 mg/dL [<3.9 and
<3.0 mmol/L]) and time above range
(>180 mg/dL [>10.0 mmol/L]) are useful
parameters for insulin dose adjustments
and reevaluation of the treatment plan.

The international consensus on CGM
provides guidance on CGM metrics (Table
6.2) and their clinical interpretation (31).
To make these metrics actionable, stan-
dardized reports with visual summaries,
such as the ambulatory glucose proﬁle
(Fig. 6.1), are recommended (31) and can
help individuals with diabetes and health
care professionals interpret the data to
guide treatment decisions (26,29). BGM
and CGM can be useful to guide medical
nutrition therapy and physical activity, de-
tect and prevent hypoglycemia, and aid
medication management. CGM metrics,
including TIR (with time below range and
time above range), can provide helpful in-
sights to inform a personalized diabetes
management plan. Remote access to glu-
cose data is growing and may help im-
prove diabetes management (32–34).

CGM systems have evolved rapidly
in both accuracy and affordability. As
such, many individuals with diabetes
have these data available to assist with
self-management and their health care
professionals’ assessment of glycemic sta-
tus. Reports generated from CGM will al-
low the health care professional and
person with diabetes to view TIR and a
calculated glucose management indicator
and assess hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia,
and glycemic variability. As discussed in a
2019 consensus report, a report format-
ted as shown in Fig. 6.1 can be generated
(31). Published data from two retrospec-
tive studies suggest a strong correlation
between TIR and A1C, with a goal of
70% TIR aligning with an A1C of (cid:1)7%
(53 mmol/mol) (24,27). Note that the
goals of therapy next to each metric in
Fig. 6.1 (e.g., low, <4%; very low, <1%)
serve as values to guide changes in
therapy. For older adults using CGM,
the recommended percent time spent
in target range of 70–180 mg/dL is 50%
(or 12 h per day) and the recommended
time spent in hypoglycemia of less than
70 mg/dL should not be more than 1%,
or 15 min per day, to minimize hypogly-
cemia risk (35–38). In this population,
more permissive hyperglycemia is al-
lowed (up to 50% of the time in 24 h).

GLYCEMIC GOALS

Recommendations
6.3a An A1C goal of <7% (<53 mmol/
mol) is appropriate for many nonpreg-
nant adults without severe hypoglyce-
mia or frequent hypoglycemia affecting
health or quality of life. A
6.3b A goal time in range of >70% in
people using CGM is appropriate for
many nonpregnant adults. B
6.3c A goal percent time <70 mg/dL
(<3.9 mmol/L) of <4% (or <1% for
older adults) and a goal percent time
<54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) of <1%
are recommended in people using
CGM to prevent hypoglycemia. Dein-
tensify or modify therapy if these
goals are not met. B
6.4 Based on health care professional
judgment and the preference of the
person with diabetes, achievement of
lower A1C levels than the goal of 7%
(53 mmol/mol) may be acceptable and
even beneﬁcial if it can be achieved
safely without frequent or severe hypo-
glycemia or other adverse effects of
treatment. B
6.5 Less stringent glycemic goals may
be appropriate for individuals with
limited life expectancy or where the
harms of treatment are greater than
the beneﬁts. B
6.6 Deintensify hypoglycemia-causing
medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, or
meglitinides), or switch to a medica-
tion class with lower hypoglycemia
risk, for individuals who are at high risk
for hypoglycemia, within individual-
ized glycemic goals. B
6.7 Deintensify diabetes medications for
individuals for whom the harms and/or
burdens of treatment may be greater
than the beneﬁts, within individualized
glycemic goals. B
6.8 Reassess glycemic goals based on
the individualized criteria shown in
Fig. 6.2. E
6.9 Set a glycemic goal during consul-
tations to improve outcomes. A

For all populations, it is critical that the
glycemic goals be woven into an indi-
vidualized, person-centered strategy
(39). The glycemic goals for many non-
pregnant adults are shown in Table 6.3,
and Fig. 6.2 summarizes how A1C goals
should be individualized by an individual’s
health, function, and other modifying

factors. For example, less stringent A1C
goals are appropriate for individuals
with signiﬁcant functional and cognitive
impairments. For more details regarding
glycemic goals in older adults, please refer
to Section 13, “Older Adults.” For glycemic
goals in children, please refer to Section
14, “Children and Adolescents.” For gly-
cemic goals during pregnancy, please
refer to Section 15, “Management of
Diabetes in Pregnancy.”

Health care professionals should en-
gage in shared decision-making with the
individual (as well as with family mem-
bers and caregivers) and should con-
sider adjusting goals for simplifying the
treatment plan if this change is needed
to improve safety and medication-taking
behavior. Setting speciﬁc glycemic (and
other) goals during consultations has
been demonstrated to improve glycemic
outcomes for individuals with diabetes
(40).

Glucose Lowering and Microvascular
Complications
Hyperglycemia deﬁnes diabetes, and
achieving glycemic goals is fundamental to
diabetes management. The level of chronic
hyperglycemia is the best-established con-
comitant risk factor associated with mi-
crovascular complications (i.e., diabetic
retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropa-
thy). This is best understood by the fact
that nerve, retinal, and kidney cells do
not require insulin for intracellular glucose
entry. Consequently,
the exposure of
these cells to elevated ambient glucose
levels even in the presence of insulin

deﬁciency (absolute or relative) will re-
sult in intracellular metabolic dysfunc-
tion and increased risk of microvascular
complications.

The Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial (DCCT) (41), a prospective ran-
domized controlled trial of
intensive
(mean A1C (cid:1)7% [(cid:1)53 mmol/mol]) versus
standard (mean A1C (cid:1)9% [(cid:1)75 mmol/mol])
glycemic management in people with
type 1 diabetes, showed deﬁnitively that
better glycemic status is associated with
50–76% reductions in rates of develop-
ment and progression of microvascular
complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, and
diabetic kidney disease). Follow-up of the
DCCT cohorts in the Epidemiology of
Diabetes Interventions and Complications
(EDIC) study (42,43) demonstrated persis-
tence of these microvascular beneﬁts over
two decades despite the fact that the gly-
cemic separation between the treatment
groups diminished and disappeared during
follow-up.

The Kumamoto study (44) and UK Pro-
spective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (45,46)
examined the effects of “intensive glyce-
mic control” among people with short-
duration type 2 diabetes, although glycemic
lowering in these studies was not intensive
by current standards (mean A1C was
7.1% vs. 9.4% in Kumamoto and 7.0% vs.
7.9% in UKPDS). These trials found lower
rates of microvascular complications in
the intervention arms, with long-term
follow-up of the UKPDS cohorts showing
enduring effects on most microvascular
complications (47). These studies highlight

the long-term beneﬁts of early glycemic
lowering in type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, improved glycemia has been
shown to reduce microvascular complica-
tions of type 1 and type 2 diabetes when
instituted early in the course of disease
(2,48). The DCCT (41) and UKPDS (49)
studies demonstrated a curvilinear rela-
tionship between attained A1C level and
microvascular complications. Such results
suggest that, on a population level, the
greatest number of complications will be
averted by taking individuals with diabe-
tes from very high to moderate A1C lev-
els. These analyses also suggest that
further lowering of A1C from 7% to 6%
(53 mmol/mol to 42 mmol/mol) is asso-
ciated with further reduction in the risk
of microvascular complications, although
the absolute risk reductions become
much smaller. The implication of these
ﬁndings is that there is no need to dein-
tensify therapy for an individual with an
A1C between 6% and 7% in the setting
of low hypoglycemia risk with a long
life expectancy. There are newer phar-
macologic agents that do not cause hypo-
glycemia, making it possible to maintain
glycemic status without the risk of hypo-
glycemia (see Section 9, “Pharmacologic
Approaches to Glycemic Treatment”).
Moreover, CGM use was not as common
when these trials were conducted and
automated insulin delivery systems were
not available; these have been shown to
improve glucose levels without increas-
ing hypoglycemia.

Among individuals with type 2 diabetes,

Figure 6.2—Individualized A1C goals for nonpregnant adults. Select the glycemic goal based on individual health and function as described at the
top of the ﬁgure. Consider modifying to a more or less stringent goal according to the factors listed in the table. Older adults are classiﬁed as
healthy (few coexisting chronic illnesses, intact cognitive and functional status), as having complex/intermediate health (multiple coexisting chronic
illnesses, two or more instrumental impairments to activities of daily living, or mild to moderate cognitive impairment), or as having very complex/
poor health (long-term care or end-stage chronic illnesses, moderate to severe cognitive impairment, or two or more impairments to activities of
daily living). Select glycemic goals that avoid symptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in all individuals. Consider individuals’ resources and
support systems to safely achieve glycemic goals. Incorporate the preferences and goals of people with diabetes through shared decision-making.

intervention arm (50–54).
Importantly,
these landmark studies were conducted
prior to the approval of glucagon-like
peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)
and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitors, and intensive glycemic
management was achieved predominantly
through greater use of insulin. Findings
from these studies, including the concern-
ing increase in mortality in the intensive
treatment arm of ACCORD, suggest cau-
tion is needed in treating diabetes to

near-normal A1C goals in people with
long-standing type 2 diabetes using medi-
cations with a high risk for hypoglycemia.

Glucose Lowering and
Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a more
common cause of death than microvascular
complications in populations with diabetes.
The modern multifaceted management of
diabetes, with a focus on the treatment of
hypertension and the use of statins, has

tions, impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, and individual considerations (per Fig. 6.2).
‡Postprandial glucose may warrant special attention if A1C goals are not met despite

reduced the prevalence of atherosclerotic
CVD to around double compared with that
of people without diabetes (55).

The DCCT in individuals with type 1 dia-
betes and the UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE,
and VADT studies in type 2 diabetes all at-
tempted to address whether intensive gly-
cemic management reduced CVD events
(41,50,51,53). ACCORD, ADVANCE, and
VADT were conducted in relatively older
participants with a longer duration of dia-
betes (mean duration 8–11 years) and ei-
ther CVD or multiple cardiovascular risk
factors. Details of these studies are re-
viewed extensively in the joint ADA po-
sition statement “Intensive Glycemic
Control and the Prevention of Cardio-
vascular Events:
Implications of the
ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VA Diabetes
Trials” (56).

No signiﬁcant reduction in composite
CVD events was demonstrated at the end
of the intervention in any of these stud-
ies, and ACCORD was stopped prema-
turely at 3.5 years because of an increase
in total mortality, particularly sudden CVD
deaths. Serious concerns with the inten-
sive glycemic treatment plan used in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S134 Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

ACCORD included the rapid escalation of
therapies, the early use of large doses of
insulin, substantial weight gain, and
frequent hypoglycemia. These overall
negative results were not unexpected,
as blood glucose has subsequently been
shown to be a relatively weak CVD risk
factor in isolation compared with other
CVD risk factors, such as hypertension or
hypercholesterolemia. Consequently, even
if a wide separation in A1C could be safely
obtained, it would take a long time for the
CVD beneﬁt to accrue. However, a meta-
analysis of individual participant data
from UKPDS, ACCORD, ADVANCE, and
VADT demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in myocardial infarctions and major
CVD events but no difference in stroke,
heart failure, or mortality between in-
tensive and less intensive glycemic man-
agement (57).

Longer-term epidemiological follow-up
has been performed in these studies,
and a clear pattern of CVD beneﬁt has
emerged (58–60).
In the post-DCCT
follow-up of the EDIC cohort, participants
previously randomized to the intensive
arm had a signiﬁcant 57% reduction in
the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction,
stroke, or cardiovascular death compared
with those previously randomized to the
standard arm (58). The beneﬁt of inten-
sive glycemic management in this cohort
with type 1 diabetes has been shown to
persist for several decades (59) and to be
associated with a modest reduction in
all-cause mortality (61).

UKPDS post-trial monitoring, with
20 years of total follow-up, has shown
reductions in myocardial infarctions and
total mortality both in the group of over-
weight individuals treated with metfor-
min and in the group previously treated
intensively with sulfonylureas or insulin
(47). Shorter overall follow-up of the
VADT (10 years) has shown a signiﬁcant
reduction in the primary outcome of major
CVD events, with myocardial
infarctions
and heart failure being the commonest
outcomes (60). In contrast, shorter follow-
up of the ADVANCE study in the Action in
Diabetes and Vascular Disease Preterax
and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation
Post Trial Observational Study (ADVANCE-
ON) demonstrated no signiﬁcant effect on
CVD events (62). Even in the epidemiolog-
ical follow-up of ACCORD in the Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes

Follow-On Study (ACCORDION), the ex-
cess increase in total mortality that was
seen during 3.5 years of intensive treat-
ment was reduced by returning to conven-
tional management, and therefore there
was no difference in total mortality after a
total of 9 years of follow-up (63). Collec-
tively, the results of these studies conﬁrm
that long-term intensive glycemic man-
agement reduces CVD events, particularly
myocardial infarctions.

As discussed above, these landmark
studies in individuals with type 2 diabetes
need to be considered with the important
caveat that GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibi-
tors were not yet in clinical use. These
agents with established cardiovascular
and kidney beneﬁts appear to be safe and
beneﬁcial in this group of individuals at
high risk for cardiovascular and kidney
complications. Randomized clinical trials
examining these agents for cardiovascu-
lar safety were not designed to test
higher versus lower A1C; therefore, be-
yond post hoc analysis of these trials, we
do not have evidence that it is the glu-
cose lowering per se by these agents that
confers the CVD and kidney beneﬁts (64).
Additional beneﬁcial pleotropic effects of
these agents may include weight loss, he-
modynamic effects, blood pressure lower-
ing, and anti-inﬂammatory changes.

As discussed further below, severe hy-
poglycemia is a potent marker of high ab-
solute risk of cardiovascular events and
mortality (65). Therefore, health care pro-
fessionals should be vigilant in preventing
hypoglycemia and should not aggressively
attempt to achieve near-normal A1C levels
in people in whom such goals cannot be
safely and reasonably achieved. As dis-
cussed in Section 9, “Pharmacologic App-
roaches to Glycemic Treatment,” addition
of speciﬁc SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs
that have demonstrated CVD beneﬁt is
recommended in individuals with estab-
lished CVD, chronic kidney disease, and
heart failure. As outlined in more detail in
Section 9, “Pharmacologic Approaches to
Glycemic Treatment,” and Section 10,
“Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Man-
agement,” the cardiovascular beneﬁts of
SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs are not con-
tingent upon A1C lowering; therefore, initi-
ation can be considered in people with
type 2 diabetes and CVD independent of
the current A1C, A1C goal, or metformin

therapy. Based on these considerations,
the following two strategies are offered
(66):

1. If already on dual therapy or multiple
glucose-lowering therapies and not on
an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 RA, con-
sider switching to one of these agents
with proven cardiovascular beneﬁt.
2. Introduce SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs
in people with CVD at A1C goal (indepen-
dent of metformin) for cardiovascular
beneﬁt, independent of baseline A1C
or individualized A1C goal.

Setting and Modifying Glycemic
Goals
Glycemic goals and management should
be individualized and not one size ﬁts all.
To prevent both microvascular and macro-
vascular complications of diabetes, there
is a major call to overcome therapeutic in-
ertia and treat to individualized goals
(56,67).

Numerous factors must be considered
when setting a glycemic goal. The ADA
proposes general goals that are appropri-
ate for many people but emphasizes the
importance of individualization based on
key person characteristics. Glycemic goals
must be individualized in the context of
shared decision-making to address indi-
vidual needs and preferences and con-
sider characteristics that inﬂuence risks
and beneﬁts of therapy; this approach
may optimize engagement and self-
efﬁcacy.

The factors to consider in individualiz-
ing goals are depicted in Fig. 6.2. This ﬁg-
ure is not designed to be applied rigidly in
the care of a given individual but to be
used as a broad framework to guide clini-
cal decision-making (39) and engage peo-
ple with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in
shared decision-making. More aggressive
goals may be recommended if they can
be achieved safely and with an accept-
able burden of therapy and if life expec-
tancy is sufﬁcient to reap the beneﬁts of
stringent goals. Less stringent goals (e.g.,
A1C up to 8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be
recommended if the individual’s life ex-
pectancy is such that the beneﬁts of an
intensive goal may not be realized or if
the risks and burdens outweigh the po-
tential beneﬁts. Severe or frequent hypo-
glycemia is an absolute indication for the
modiﬁcation of treatment plans, includ-
ing setting higher glycemic goals.

Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia

S135

Diabetes is a chronic disease that pro-
gresses over decades. Thus, a goal that
might be appropriate for an individual
early in the course of their diabetes may
change over time. Newly diagnosed indi-
viduals and/or those without comorbid-
ities that limit life expectancy may beneﬁt
from intensive glycemic goals proven to
prevent microvascular complications. Both
DCCT/EDIC and UKPDS suggested that
there is metabolic memory, or a legacy ef-
fect, in which a ﬁnite period of intensive
glucose lowering yielded beneﬁts that
extended for decades after that period
ended. However, there are few recent
data on the effects of long-term glucose
lowering using modern treatment strate-
gies. Thus, a ﬁnite period of intensive
treatment to near-normal A1C may yield
enduring beneﬁts even if treatment is
subsequently deintensiﬁed as character-
istics change. Over time, comorbidities
may emerge, decreasing life expectancy
and thereby decreasing the potential to
reap beneﬁts from intensive treatment.
Also, with longer disease duration, diabe-
tes may become more difﬁcult to man-
age, with increasing risks and burdens of
therapy. Thus, glycemic goals should be
reevaluated over time to balance the risks
and beneﬁts.

Accordingly, clinicians should continue
to evaluate the balance of risks and ben-
eﬁts of diabetes medications for individ-
uals who have achieved individualized
glycemic goals, and they should deinten-
sify (decrease the dose or stop) diabetes
medications where their risks exceed
their beneﬁts. Hypoglycemia is the major
risk to individuals treated with insulin,
sulfonylureas, or meglitinides, and it is
appropriate to deintensify these medica-
tions where there is a high risk for hypo-
glycemia (see HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK ASSESSMENT,
below). Switching a high-hypoglycemia-risk
medication to lower-hypoglycemia-risk
therapy (see Section 9, “Pharmacologic Ap-
proaches to Glycemic Treatment”) should
be considered if needed to achieve individ-
ualized glycemic goals or where individuals
have evidence-based indications for alter-
native medications (e.g., use of SGLT2 in-
hibitors in the setting of heart failure or
diabetic kidney disease and use of GLP-1
RAs in the setting of CVD or obesity). Clini-
cians should also consider medication bur-
dens other than hypoglycemia, including
tolerability, difﬁculties of administra-
tion, impact on education or employ-
ment, and ﬁnancial cost. These factors

should be balanced against beneﬁts from
glycemic lowering and disease-speciﬁc
beneﬁts of newer medications that may
be independent of glycemic lowering
(Section 9, “Pharmacologic Approaches
to Glycemic Treatment”). Multiple trials
have shown that deintensiﬁcation of
diabetes treatment can be achieved
successfully and safely (68–70). It is im-
portant to partner with people with dia-
betes during the deintensiﬁcation process
to understand their goals of diabetes treat-
ment and agree upon appropriate glycemic
monitoring, glucose levels, and goals of
care (71).

HYPOGLYCEMIA ASSESSMENT,
PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT

Recommendations
6.10 Review history of hypoglyce-
mia at every clinical encounter for
all individuals at risk for hypoglycemia,
and evaluate hypoglycemic events as
indicated. C
6.11 Screen individuals at risk for hy-
poglycemia for impaired hypoglyce-
mia awareness at least annually and
when clinically appropriate. E Refer
to a trained health care professional
for evidence-based intervention to
improve hypoglycemia awareness. A
6.12 Screen individuals at high risk
for hypoglycemia or with severe and/or
frequent hypoglycemia for fear of hypo-
glycemia at least annually and when
clinically appropriate. E Refer
to a
trained health care professional for evi-
dence-based intervention. A
6.13 Clinicians should consider an
individual’s risk for hypoglycemia (see
Table 6.5) when selecting diabetes
medications and glycemic goals. E
6.14 Use of CGM is beneﬁcial and
recommended for individuals at high
risk for hypoglycemia. A
6.15 Glucose is the preferred treat-
ment for the conscious individual with
glucose <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L),
although any form of carbohydrate
that contains glucose may be used.
Avoid using foods or beverages high
in fat and/or protein for initial treat-
ment of hypoglycemia. Fifteen mi-
nutes after initial treatment, repeat
the treatment if hypoglycemia per-
sists. B
6.16 Glucagon should be prescribed
for all individuals taking insulin or
at high risk for hypoglycemia. A

Family, caregivers, school person-
nel, and others providing support
to these individuals should know its
location and be educated on how to
administer it. Glucagon preparations
that do not have to be reconstituted
are preferred. B
6.17 All individuals taking insulin A
or at risk for hypoglycemia C should
receive structured education for hy-
poglycemia prevention and treat-
ment, with ongoing education for
those who experience hypoglycemic
events.
6.18 One or more episodes of level 2
or 3 hypoglycemia should prompt
reevaluation of the treatment plan,
including deintensifying or switching
diabetes medications if appropriate. E
6.19 Regularly assess cognitive func-
tion; if impaired or declining cognition
is found, the clinician, person with di-
abetes, and caregiver should increase
vigilance for hypoglycemia. B

Hypoglycemia Deﬁnitions and Event
Rates
Hypoglycemia is often the major limiting
factor in the glycemic management of
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recommen-
dations regarding the classiﬁcation of hy-
poglycemia are outlined in Table 6.4 (72).
Level 1 hypoglycemia is deﬁned as a mea-
surable glucose concentration <70 mg/dL
(<3.9 mmol/L) and $54 mg/dL ($3.0
mmol/L). A blood glucose concentration
of 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) has been rec-
ognized as a threshold for adrenergic re-
sponses to falling glucose in people
without diabetes. Symptoms of hypogly-
cemia include, but are not limited to,
shakiness, irritability, confusion, tachycar-
dia, sweating, and hunger (73). Because
many people with diabetes demonstrate
impaired counterregulatory responses to
hypoglycemia and/or experience impaired
hypoglycemia awareness, a measured glu-
cose level <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) is
considered clinically important, regardless
of symptoms. Level 2 hypoglycemia (de-
ﬁned as a blood glucose concentration
<54 mg/dL [<3.0 mmol/L]) is the thresh-
old at which neuroglycopenic symptoms
begin to occur and requires immediate
action to resolve the hypoglycemic
event. If an individual has level 2 hypogly-
cemia without adrenergic or neuroglyco-
penic symptoms, they likely have impaired

Hypoglycemia Risk Assessment
Assessment of an individual’s risk for hy-
poglycemia includes evaluating clinical
risk factors as well as relevant social, cul-
tural, and economic factors (Table 6.5).
Recommendations 6.10–6.19 group individ-
uals with diabetes into two hypoglycemia
risk categories with clinical signiﬁcance. In-
dividuals at risk for hypoglycemia are those
treated with insulin, sulfonylureas, or megli-
tinides; clinically signiﬁcant hypoglycemia is
rare among individuals taking other diabe-
tes medication classes (95,96). Individuals
at high risk for hypoglycemia are the sub-
set of individuals at risk for hypoglycemia
who either have a major hypoglycemia

represent the vast majority of hypoglyce-
mic events, and they also substantially
underestimate level 3 hypoglycemia
(88,92,93). Nevertheless, they reveal a
substantial burden of hypoglycemia-
related hospital utilization in the community
(88–91). Level 1 and level 2 hypoglycemia
can be ascertained from patient self-report

Major risk factors are those that have a consistent, independent association with a high risk for
level 2 or 3 hypoglycemia. Other risk factors are those with less consistent evidence or a weaker
association. These risk factors are identiﬁed through observational analyses and are intended to
be used for hypoglycemia risk stratiﬁcation. Individuals considered at high risk for hypoglycemia
are those with $1 major risk factor or who have multiple other risk factors (determined by the
judgment) (89,90,95,97–100,120,180). Proximal

insulin therapy (including multiple daily injections of insulin, continuous subcutaneous insulin in-
fusion, or automated insulin delivery systems), followed by basal insulin, followed by sulfonylur-

hypoglycemia risk. †Accounting for treatment plan and diabetes subtype, the oldest individuals

hypoglycemia awareness (discussed
further in HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK ASSESSMENT,
below). This clinical scenario warrants
investigation and review of the treat-
ment plan (74,75). Lastly, level 3 hypo-
glycemia is deﬁned as a severe event
characterized by altered mental and/or
physical functioning that requires assis-
tance from another person for recov-
ery, irrespective of glucose level.

Hypoglycemia has a broad range of
negative health consequences (76). Level
3 hypoglycemia may be recognized or un-
recognized and can progress to loss of
consciousness, seizure, coma, or death.
Level 3 hypoglycemia was associated with
mortality in both the standard and the in-
tensive glycemia arms of the ACCORD
trial, but the relationships between hypo-
glycemia, achieved A1C, and treatment
intensity were not straightforward (77).
An association of level 3 hypoglycemia
with mortality was also found in the
ADVANCE trial and in clinical practice
(78,79). Hypoglycemia can cause acute
harm to the person with diabetes or
others, especially if it causes falls, motor
vehicle accidents, or other injury (80).
Hypoglycemia may also cause substantial
anxiety that can reduce the quality of life
of individuals with diabetes and their
caregivers and may contribute to prob-
lems with diabetes self-management
and treatment (81–83). Recurrent level 2
hypoglycemia and/or level 3 hypoglyce-
mia is an urgent medical
issue and
requires intervention with medical treat-
ment plan adjustment, behavioral inter-
vention, delivery of diabetes
self-
management education and support,
and use of technology to assist with
hypoglycemia prevention and identiﬁ-
cation (75,84–87).

Studies of rates of hypoglycemia pre-
dominantly rely on claims data for hospital-
izations and emergency department visits
(88–91). These studies do not capture the
level 1 and level 2 hypoglycemia that

risk factor or have multiple other risk fac-
tors (determined by the health care pro-
fessional incorporating clinical judgment)
(Table 6.5). This risk stratiﬁcation is based
on epidemiologic studies of hypoglycemia
risk (89,90,95,97–101). Validated tools have
been developed to estimate hypoglyce-
mia risk using predominantly electronic
health record data (102–104). However,
these tools do not include all of the im-
portant hypoglycemia risk factors, and
more research is needed to determine
how they can best be incorporated into
clinical care.

Among individuals at risk for hypo-
glycemia, prior hypoglycemic events,
especially level 2 or 3 events, are the
strongest risk factors for hypoglycemia re-
currence (96,99,105–107). Hypoglycemia
history should be assessed at every clinical
encounter and should include hypoglyce-
mic event frequency, severity, precipi-
tants, symptoms (or lack thereof), and
approach to treatment. It is essential to
correlate home glucose readings, both
from glucose meters and CGM systems,
with symptoms and treatment, as individ-
uals may experience and treat hypoglyce-
mic symptoms without checking their
glucose level (108), treat normal glucose
values as hypoglycemic, or tolerate hy-
poglycemia without treatment either
because of lack of symptoms or to
avoid hyperglycemia.

Individuals at risk for hypoglycemia
should also be screened for impaired hy-
poglycemia awareness (also called hypo-
glycemia unawareness or hypoglycemia-
associated autonomic failure) at least
yearly. Impaired hypoglycemia awareness
is deﬁned as not experiencing the typical
counterregulatory hormone release at
low glucose levels or the associated symp-
toms, which often occurs in individuals
with long-standing diabetes or recurrent
hypoglycemia (109). Individuals with im-
paired hypoglycemia awareness may ex-
perience confusion as the ﬁrst sign of
hypoglycemia, which can create fear of
hypoglycemia and severely impact qual-
ity of life (110). Impaired hypoglycemia
awareness dramatically increases the
risk for level 3 hypoglycemia (111). Vali-
dated questionnaires for assessing im-
paired hypoglycemia awareness include
the single-question Pedersen-Bjergaard
(112) and Gold (113) tools; the Clarke
(114) and HypoA-Q (115) tools are
longer questionnaires that evaluate

multiple domains of impaired hypoglyce-
mia awareness. Comparisons between
these tools largely yield good agreement
(116,117). To efﬁciently screen for im-
in
paired hypoglycemia awareness
clinical practice, clinicians can ask a
single question based on these tools
such as “Can you always feel when your
blood sugar is low?” and follow up
“No” responses with a more detailed
evaluation.

Other notable clinical and biological
risk factors for hypoglycemia are older
age, multimorbidity, cognitive impairment,
chronic kidney disease and end-stage kid-
ney disease in particular, CVD, depression,
and neuropathy (95,96). Female sex has
also been found to be an independent
risk factor for hypoglycemia in multiple
studies, although the mechanisms of this
relationship are unclear and require fur-
ther research (95). Cognitive impairment
has a strong bidirectional association with
hypoglycemia, and recurrent severe hypo-
glycemic episodes were associated with a
greater decline in psychomotor and men-
tal efﬁciency after long-term follow-up of
the DCCT/EDIC cohort (118). Therefore,
cognitive function should be routinely as-
sessed among older adults with diabetes.

There are a number of important so-
cial, cultural, and economic hypoglycemia
risk factors that should be considered.
Food insecurity is associated with increased
risk of hypoglycemia-related emergency de-
partment visits and hospitalizations in low-
income households, and this was shown
to be mitigated by increased federal nutri-
tion program beneﬁts (119). In general,
individuals with low annual household
incomes (96), individuals who live in socio-
economically deprived areas (99), and indi-
viduals who are underinsured (100) or
experiencing housing instability (120) ex-
perience higher rates of emergency de-
partment visits and hospitalizations for
hypoglycemia. Clinicians should also be
aware of cultural practices that may inﬂu-
ence glycemic management (which are dis-
cussed in detail in Section 5, “Facilitating
Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being
to Improve Health Outcomes”), such as
fasting as part of religious observance. Fast-
ing may increase the risk for hypoglycemia
among individuals treated with insulin
or insulin secretagogues if not properly
planned for, so clinicians need to engage
these individuals to codevelop a diabe-
tes treatment plan that is safe and re-
spectful of their traditions (121).

Young children with type 1 diabetes
and older adults, including those with
type 1 and type 2 diabetes (122,123), are
noted as being particularly vulnerable to
hypoglycemia because of their reduced
ability to recognize hypoglycemic symp-
toms and effectively communicate their
needs. Individualized glycemic goals, edu-
cation, nutrition intervention (e.g., bedtime
snack to prevent overnight hypoglycemia
when speciﬁcally needed to treat low blood
glucose), physical activity management,
medication adjustment, glucose monitor-
ing, and routine clinical surveillance may
improve outcomes (109). Insulin pumps
with automated low-glucose suspend and
automated insulin delivery systems have
been shown to be effective in reducing
hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes (124).
For people with type 1 diabetes with level 3
hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unaware-
ness that persists despite medical treat-
ment, pancreas transplant alone or human
islet transplantation may be an option,
but these approaches remain experimen-
tal (125,126).

Hypoglycemia Treatment
Health care professionals should counsel
individuals with diabetes to treat hypogly-
cemia with fast-acting carbohydrates at
the hypoglycemia alert value of 70 mg/dL
(3.9 mmol/L) or less (127–129). Individuals
should be counseled to recheck their glucose
15 min after ingesting carbohydrates and to
repeat carbohydrate ingestion and seek care
for ongoing hypoglycemia.These instructions
should be reviewed at each clinical visit.

For most individuals, 15 g carbohy-
drates should be ingested. Individuals us-
ing automated insulin delivery systems
should ingest 5–10 g carbohydrates un-
less there is hypoglycemia in conjunction
with exercise or there has been signiﬁcant
overestimation of a carbohydrate/meal
bolus (130). The acute glycemic response
to food correlates better with the glucose
content than with the total carbohydrate
content. Pure glucose is the preferred ini-
tial treatment, but any form of carbohy-
drate that contains glucose will raise blood
glucose. Added fat may slow and then pro-
long the acute glycemic response. Dietary
protein intake may increase insulin secre-
tion and should not be used to treat hypo-
glycemia (131). Ongoing insulin activity or
insulin secretagogues may lead to recur-
rent hypoglycemia unless more food is in-
gested after recovery.

S138 Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Glucagon
The use of glucagon is indicated for the
treatment of hypoglycemia in people un-
able or unwilling to consume carbohy-
drates by mouth. All individuals treated
with insulin or who are at high risk of hy-
poglycemia as discussed above should be
prescribed glucagon. For these individuals,
clinicians should routinely review their ac-
cess to glucagon, as appropriate glucagon
prescribing is very low in current practice
(132–134). An individual does not need to
be a health care professional to safely ad-
minister glucagon. Those in close contact
with, or having custodial care of, these in-
dividuals (family members, roommates,
school personnel, childcare professionals,
correctional institution staff, or coworkers)
should be instructed on the use of gluca-
gon, including where the glucagon product
is kept and when and how to administer it.
It is essential that they be explicitly edu-
cated to never administer insulin to individ-
uals experiencing hypoglycemia. Glucagon
was traditionally dispensed as a powder
that requires reconstitution prior to injec-
intranasal and ready-to-
tion. However,
inject glucagon preparations are now
widely available and are preferred due
to their ease of administration resulting
in more rapid correction of hypoglycemia
(135–137). Although the physical and
chemical stability of glucagon has im-
proved with newer formulations, care
should be taken to replace glucagon
products when they reach their expira-
tion date and to store glucagon based on
speciﬁc product instructions to ensure
safe and effective use. For currently avail-
able glucagon products and associated
costs, see Table 6.6. Health insurance

providers may prefer only select glucagon
products, so it is important to check indi-
viduals’ insurance coverage and prescribe
formulary products whenever possible.

Hypoglycemia Prevention
A multicomponent hypoglycemia preven-
tion plan (Table 6.7) is critical to caring for
individuals at risk for hypoglycemia. Hypo-
glycemia prevention begins by establishing
an individual’s hypoglycemia history and
risk factors, as discussed in HYPOGLYCEMIA RISK
ASSESSMENT above. Structured education for
hypoglycemia prevention and treatment is
critical and has been shown to improve hy-
poglycemia outcomes (138,139). Educa-
tion should ideally be provided through a
diabetes self-management education and
support program or by a trained diabetes
care and education specialist, although
these services are not available in many
areas (140,141). If structured education is
not available, clinicians should educate in-
dividuals at risk for hypoglycemia on hypo-
glycemia deﬁnitions, situations that may
precipitate hypoglycemia (fasting, delayed
meals, physical activity, and illness), blood
glucose self-monitoring, avoidance of driv-
ing with hypoglycemia, step-by-step in-
structions on hypoglycemia treatment as
discussed above, and glucagon use as ap-
propriate (138).

CGM can be a valuable tool for detect-
ing and preventing hypoglycemia in many
individuals with diabetes, and it is recom-
mended for insulin-treated individuals,
especially those using multiple daily insu-
lin injections or continuous subcutaneous
insulin infusion. There is clinical trial evi-
dence that CGM reduces rates of hypo-
glycemia in these populations. CGM can

reveal asymptomatic hypoglycemia and
help identify patterns and precipitants of
hypoglycemic events (142,143). Real-time
CGM can provide alarms that can warn
individuals of falling glucose so that they
can intervene (142,143). For more infor-
mation on using BGM and CGM for hy-
poglycemia prevention, see Section 7,
“Diabetes Technology.”

An essential component of hypoglyce-
mia prevention is appropriate modiﬁca-
tion to diabetes treatment in the setting
of intercurrent illness (discussed in detail
below) or to prevent recurrent hypoglyce-
mic events. Level 2 or 3 hypoglycemic
events especially should trigger a reevalua-
tion of the individual’s diabetes treatment
plan, with consideration of deintensiﬁca-
tion of therapy within individualized glyce-
mic goals.

Individuals with impaired awareness
should be offered training to reestablish
awareness of hypoglycemia. Fear of hypo-
glycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness
often co-occur, so interventions aimed at
treating one often beneﬁt both (144).
Several evidence-based training programs
have been developed for this purpose
and have been demonstrated to reduce
rates of hypoglycemia and improve quality
of life among people with type 1 diabetes
and impaired hypoglycemia awareness
(75,145,146). However, these programs
are not currently available for clinical use.
Similar training can be provided through
qualiﬁed behavioral health professionals,
diabetes care and education specialists,
or other professionals with experience in
this area, although this approach has not
been evaluated in clinical trials. In addi-
tion, several weeks of avoidance of hypo-
glycemia, typically accomplished through
a temporary relaxation of glycemic goals,
can improve counterregulation and hypo-
glycemia awareness in many people with
diabetes (147). Hence,
individuals with
impaired hypoglycemia awareness and re-
current hypoglycemic episodes may bene-
ﬁt from short-term relaxation of glycemic
goals.

INTERCURRENT ILLNESS
Stressful events (e.g., illness, trauma, and
surgery) increase the risk for both hyper-
glycemia and hypoglycemia among individ-
uals with diabetes. In severe cases, they
may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis
or a nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperos-
molar state, which are life-threatening

Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia

S139

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hy-
perglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)
are serious, acute, and life-threatening
hyperglycemic emergencies in individu-
als with diabetes (151) that incur sub-
stantial morbidity, mortality, and costs
(152). Approximately 1% of all hospital-
izations in people with diabetes are for
hyperglycemic crises. The diagnostic cri-
teria for DKA and HHS are summarized
in Table 6.8; all criteria must be met to
establish these diagnoses. Importantly,
approximately 10% of people experiencing
DKA present with euglycemic DKA (plasma
glucose <200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]);
therefore, DKA diagnosis requires either
the presence of hyperglycemia or prior
history of diabetes (151). Euglycemic
DKA requires insulin deﬁciency and
can be associated with a variety of
factors including reduced food intake,
liver failure,
pregnancy, alcohol use,
and/or SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (153).
Additionally, DKA and HHS often pre-
sent concurrently (154),
though few
studies have examined mixed DKA-HHS
events.

There has been a concerning rise in
the rate of hyperglycemic crises in peo-
ple with both type 1 diabetes and type 2
diabetes over the past decade (91,155–
161). Recent data suggest hyperglycemic
crisis rates of up to 44.5–82.6 per 1,000
person-years among people with type 1 di-
abetes (91,159) and up to 3.2 per 1,000
person-years among people with type 2 di-
abetes (91). While DKA mortality de-
creased in the ﬁrst decade of the 21st
century (156), these improvements have

conditions that require immediate medi-
cal care. Any individuals with diabetes
experiencing illness or other stressful
events should be assessed for the need
for more frequent monitoring of glucose;
ketosis-prone individuals also require urine
or blood ketone monitoring. Clinicians
should reevaluate diabetes treatment dur-
ing these events and make adjustments
as appropriate. Clinicians should be aware
of medication interactions that may pre-
cipitate hypoglycemia. Notably, sulfonylur-
eas interact with a number of commonly
used antimicrobials (ﬂuoroquinolones, cla-
rithromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,
metronidazole, and ﬂuconazole) that can
dramatically increase their effective dose,
leading to hypoglycemia (148–150). Clini-
cians should consider temporarily de-
creasing or stopping sulfonylureas when
these antimicrobials are prescribed.

of hyperglycemia in the hospital, see Sec-
tion 16, “Diabetes Care in the Hospital.”

plateaued in the past decade (155,
159,162). Most recently available data for
inpatient mortality during hospital admis-
sion for DKA ranges from 0.2% in type 1 di-
abetes (163) to 1.0% in type 2 diabetes
(156,164). Inpatient mortality among peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes hospitalized for
HHS decreased from 1.44% in 2008 to
0.77% in 2018 (165). The only study to
have examined inpatient mortality for
mixed DKA-HHS found it to be higher than
mortality for HHS or DKA alone (154). Mor-
tality rates reported in low- and middle-
income countries are much higher than
those in developed countries, potentially
because of delayed diagnosis and treat-
ment (151). People discharged after an ep-
isode of DKA have a 1-year age-corrected
mortality rate that is 13 times higher than
the general population (166).

There are a number of clinical factors
associated with an increased risk of hy-
perglycemic crises (Table 6.9). In addition,
several studies have reported DKA at the
presentation of newly diagnosed type 1
diabetes during or after a coronavirus dis-
ease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The pre-
cise mechanisms for new-onset diabetes
in people with COVID-19 are not known,
but several complex interrelated processes
may be involved. Some drug classes can
affect carbohydrate metabolism and
precipitate the development of DKA
and HHS, including glucocorticoids, an-
tipsychotic medications, checkpoint in-
hibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors. The risk
of DKA in people with type 1 diabetes
using SGLT2 inhibitors can be 5–17
times higher than that in nonusers. In

contrast, observational studies and
randomized controlled trials have shown
that DKA is uncommon in people with
type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT2 in-
hibitors (0.6–4.9 events per 1,000
patient-years) (167). A meta-analysis
of four randomized controlled trials
found the relative risk of DKA in par-
ticipants with type 2 diabetes treated
with SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo
or active comparator arm to be 2.46
(95% CI 1.16–5.21), while a meta-analysis
of ﬁve observational studies found the
relative risk to be 1.74 (95% CI 1.07–2.83)
(168). Risk factors for DKA in individuals
with type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT2
inhibitors include very-low-carbohydrate
diets and prolonged fasting, dehydration,
excessive alcohol
intake, and the pres-
ence of autoimmunity, in addition to typi-
cal precipitating factors (168,169). Up to
2% of pregnancies with pregestational di-
abetes (most often type 1 diabetes) are
complicated by DKA. The incidence of
DKA in gestational diabetes is low
(<0.1%) (170). Pregnant individuals may
present with euglycemic DKA (glucose
<200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]), and the di-
agnosis of DKA may be hindered by the
presence of mixed acid-based disturban-
ces, particularly in the setting of hyper-
emesis. Due to signiﬁcant risk of feto-
maternal harm, pregnant individuals at
risk for DKA should be counseled on the
signs and symptoms suggestive of DKA
and seek immediate medical attention if
concern for DKA is present.

Hyperglycemic crisis should be consid-
ered in all
individuals presenting with
polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, vomit-
ing, dehydration, and change in cognitive
state (Table 6.10). Individuals at risk for
DKA should be counseled on the early
signs and symptoms of DKA, provided
with appropriate tools for accurate ke-
tone measurement (urine and/or blood
ketone tests), and educated on timely
self-management of hyperglycemia and
ketonemia (“sick day advice”) (171–173)
to prevent clinical deterioration and need
for acute care. Individuals treated with in-
tensive insulin therapy should not stop or
hold their basal insulin even if not eating,
and clinicians should provide detailed in-
structions on insulin dose adjustments in
the setting of illness or fasting to prevent
DKA occurrence and worsening. Individu-
als concerned about or experiencing DKA
should be encouraged to contact their di-
abetes care team immediately. Readily
available clinical support can help individ-
uals self-manage hyperglycemia during ill-
ness and prevent emergency department
and hospital care (174). Individuals at risk
for DKA should measure urine or blood
ketones in the presence of symptoms and
potential precipitating factors (e.g., illness,
missed insulin doses), particularly if glucose
levels exceed 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).
When hemodynamically and cognitively
intact, able to tolerate oral hydration, and
able to administer subcutaneous insulin, in-
dividuals may treat mild DKA with frequent
blood glucose and urine or blood ketone
monitoring, noncaloric hydration, and sub-
cutaneous insulin administration. However,
individuals should seek immediate medical
attention if unable to tolerate oral hydra-
tion, blood glucose levels do not improve
with insulin administration, altered mental
status is present, or any signs of worsening
illness occur. Because HHS is associated
with greater volume depletion and is
typically triggered by an acute illness, in-
dividuals with suspected HHS should be
immediately evaluated and treated in
the inpatient setting.

A substantial proportion of individuals
hospitalized with DKA experience recurrent
episodes (175,176), which underscores
the importance of engaging individuals
experiencing these events to identify trig-
gers and prevent recurrence. Structured
diabetes self-management education and
support that includes problem-solving is
effective at reducing DKA admissions,
as are psychological interventions, peer

support, individual coaching, and behav-
ioral family systems therapy (177,178). In-
dividuals who have experienced DKA or
HHS should be screened for social deter-
minants of health that can contribute to
or trigger these complications, including
inadequate access to insulin, other glu-
cose-lowering medications, and diabetes
durable medical equipment (i.e., glucose
monitoring and insulin administration
devices), and referred to appropriate
health care and/or community services
to mitigate these barriers to care (see
Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health
Behaviors and Well-being to Improve
Health Outcomes,” for additional details).
Access to CGM may also decrease risk of
DKA recurrence (179).
