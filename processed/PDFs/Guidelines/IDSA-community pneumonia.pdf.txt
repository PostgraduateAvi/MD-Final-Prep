THIS OFFICIAL CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE WAS APPROVED BY THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY MAY 2019 AND THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AUGUST 2019

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical
practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with
community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic
systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
methodology for clinical recommendations.

Results: The panel addressed 16 speciﬁc areas for recommendations
spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of
care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent

management decisions. Although some recommendations remain
unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from
new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to
revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and
additional management decisions.

Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for
recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies
for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Overview

In the more than 10 years since the last
American Thoracic Society(ATS)/Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
guideline (1), there have been changes in
the process for guideline development, as
well as generation of new clinical data. ATS
and IDSA agreed on moving from the
narrative style of previous documents to the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)
format. We thus developed this updated
CAP guideline as a series of questions
answered from available evidence in an “is
option A better than option B” format
using the Patient or Population,
Intervention, Comparison, Outcome
(PICO) framework (2).

Given the expansion in information
related to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and
management decisions for the care of
patients with CAP, we have purposely
narrowed the scope of this guideline to
address decisions from the time of clinical
diagnosis of pneumonia (i.e., signs and
symptoms of pneumonia with radiographic
conﬁrmation) to completion of
antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest

imaging. The document does not address
either the initial clinical diagnostic criteria
or prevention of pneumonia.

CAP is an extraordinarily

heterogeneous illness, both in the range
of responsible pathogens and the host
response. Thus, the PICO questions we
identiﬁed for this guideline do not represent
the full range of relevant questions about the
management of CAP but encompass a set of
core questions identiﬁed as high priority by
the panel. In addition, although each
question was addressed using systematic
reviews of available high-quality studies,
the evidence base was often insufﬁcient,
emphasizing the continued importance of
clinical judgment and experience in treating
patients with this illness and the need for
continued research.

Introduction

This guideline addresses the clinical entity of
pneumonia that is acquired outside of the
hospital setting. Although we recognize that
CAP is frequently diagnosed without the use
of a chest radiograph, especially in the
ambulatory setting, we have focused on
studies that used radiographic criteria for

Therapy Instead of Standard
CAP Regimens?

Conclusions

deﬁning CAP, given the known inaccuracy
of clinical signs and symptoms alone for
CAP diagnosis (3). This guideline focuses
on patients in the United States who have
not recently completed foreign travel,
especially to regions with emerging
respiratory pathogens. This guideline also
focuses on adults who do not have an
immunocompromising condition, such as
inherited or acquired immune deﬁciency or
drug-induced neutropenia, including
patients actively receiving cancer
chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV
with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid
organ or bone marrow transplant
recipients.

Antibiotic recommendations for the
empiric treatment of CAP are based on
selecting agents effective against the major
treatable bacterial causes of CAP.
Traditionally, these bacterial pathogens
include Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus,
Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae,
and Moraxella catarrhalis. The microbial
etiology of CAP is changing, particularly
with the widespread introduction of the
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and there
is increased recognition of the role of viral

pathogens. The online supplement contains
a more detailed discussion of CAP
microbiology. As bacterial pathogens often
coexist with viruses and there is no current
diagnostic test accurate enough or fast
enough to determine that CAP is due solely
to a virus at the time of presentation (see
below), our recommendations are to
initially treat empirically for possible
bacterial infection or coinfection. In
addition, the emergence of multidrug-
resistant pathogens, including methicillin-
resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, requires separate
recommendations when the risk of
each of these pathogens is elevated. We
acknowledge that other multidrug-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae can cause CAP,
including organisms producing extended-
spectrum b-lactamase, but we do not
discuss them separately because they are
much less common and are effectively
covered by the strategies presented for
P. aeruginosa. Therefore, throughout this
document when discussing P. aeruginosa
we are also referring to other similar
multiresistant gram-negative bacteria.

We have maintained the convention

of separate recommendations on the
basis of the severity of illness. Although
historically site of care (outpatient,
inpatient general ward, or ICU) has served
as a severity surrogate, decisions about site
of care may be based on considerations
other than severity and can vary widely
between hospitals and practice sites.
We have therefore chosen to use the
IDSA/ATS CAP severity criteria that have
been validated and deﬁne severe CAP as
present in patients with either one major
criterion or three or more minor criteria.
(Table 1)

This guideline reafﬁrms many

recommendations from the 2007 statement.
However, new evidence and a new process
have led to signiﬁcant changes, which are
summarized in Table 2.

Methods

The guideline development methodology
and how conﬂict of interest was managed
are presented in the online supplement. In
brief, the list of PICO questions was ﬁnalized
based on a prioritization of the most
important management decisions balanced
against the decision to reduce the overall
length of the document and total number of

recommendations to maximize readability
and usability. We followed the GRADE
standards for evaluating the evidence for
each PICO and assigned a quality of
evidence rating of high, moderate, low, or
very low. On the basis of the quality of
evidence, recommendations were assigned
as strong or conditional. In some cases,
strong recommendations were made in the
setting of low or very low quality of evidence
in accordance with the GRADE rules for
when such recommendations are allowable
(e.g., when the consequences of the
recommendation were high, such as
preventing harm or saving life). In all other
cases, recommendations that were based on
low or very low quality of evidence and not
believed to represent standards of care were
labeled as conditional recommendations.
Statements in favor of strong
recommendations begin with the words
“We recommend . . .”; statements in favor
of conditional recommendations begin
with the words “We suggest . . . .”
Although we speciﬁed pairwise PICO
questions for all antibiotic options in the
outpatient and inpatient settings, we
summarized the recommendations using
lists of treatment options, in no preferred
order, rather than retain the PICO format
for this section.

Recommendations

Question 1: In Adults with CAP,
Should Gram Stain and Culture of
Lower Respiratory Secretions Be
Obtained at the Time of Diagnosis?

Recommendation. We recommend not
obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture
routinely in adults with CAP managed in the
outpatient setting (strong recommendation,
very low quality of evidence).

We recommend obtaining pretreatment

Gram stain and culture of respiratory
secretions in adults with CAP managed in
the hospital setting who:
1. are classiﬁed as severe CAP (see Table 1),
especially if they are intubated (strong
recommendation, very low quality of
evidence); or

2.

a. are being empirically treated for
MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong
recommendation, very low quality
of evidence); or

b. were previously infected with MRSA
or P. aeruginosa, especially those
with prior respiratory tract infection
(conditional recommendation, very
low quality of evidence); or
c. were hospitalized and received

parenteral antibiotics, whether during the
hospitalization event or not, in the last
90 days (conditional recommendation,
very low quality of evidence).

Summary of the evidence. Arguments
for trying to determine the etiology of CAP
are that 1) a resistant pathogen may be
identiﬁed; 2) therapy may be narrowed; 3)
some pathogens, such as Legionella, have
public health implications; 4) therapy may
be adjusted when patients fail initial
therapy; and 5) the constantly changing
epidemiology of CAP requires ongoing
evaluation.

These arguments stand in contrast to

the lack of high-quality evidence
demonstrating that routine diagnostic
testing improves individual patient
outcomes. Studies that speciﬁcally evaluated
the use of sputum Gram stain and culture
alone (4–7), or in combination with other
microbiological testing (8–11), also did not
demonstrate better patient outcomes.
The overall poor yield of sputum
evaluation for detecting organisms causing
CAP limits its impact on management and
patient outcomes. Obtaining a valid sputum
specimen can be challenging because of
patient-related characteristics (12–17).
Performance characteristics of testing also
vary by organism, receipt of prior
antibiotics, and setting. For example, in
patients with bacteremic pneumococcal
pneumonia who have not received
antibiotics, microscopic examination and
culture of a good-quality sputum sample
detects pneumococci in 86% of cases (18).
Rationale for the recommendation. In
balancing the lack of evidence supporting
routine sputum culture with the desire for
improved antimicrobial stewardship, the
committee voted to continue the stance of
previous guidelines in recommending
neither for nor against routinely obtaining
sputum Gram stain and culture in all adults
with CAP managed in the hospital setting.
Whether to culture patients or not should be
determined by individual clinicians on the
basis of clinical presentation, local
etiological considerations, and local
antimicrobial stewardship processes.
The committee identiﬁed two

situations in which we recommend sputum

Gram stain and culture: in hospitalized
patients with severe CAP, and when strong
risk factors for MRSA and P. aeruginosa are
identiﬁed, unless local etiological data have
already shown these pathogens are very
infrequently identiﬁed in patients with CAP.
Patients who have severe CAP requiring
intubation should have lower respiratory tract
samples, such as endotracheal aspirates, sent
for Gram stain and culture promptly after
intubation, particularly as these patients may
be more likely to have pneumonia due to
MRSA or P. aeruginosa, and endotracheal
aspirates have a better yield of microbiological
organisms than sputum culture (19).

We recommend obtaining sputum for
Gram stain and culture in situations when
risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa are
present, both when initial empiric therapy
is expanded to cover these pathogens and
when it is not expanded. In the former case,
negative microbiological test results may be
used to deescalate therapy, and in the latter
case, positive microbiological test results
may be used to adjust therapy. As discussed
later, although there are numerous studies
identifying individual risk factors for MRSA
and P. aeruginosa, many of these
associations are weak and vary across sites.

AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY DOCUMENTS

The most consistently strong risk factor to
consider is prior infection with either
MRSA or P. aeruginosa. In addition,
hospitalization and treatment with
parenteral antibiotics in the last 90 days is
associated with an increased risk of these
pathogens, and so we recommend
sputum culture in this situation. These
recommendations are not based on high-
grade evidence but reﬂect the committee’s
desire to improve antibiotic use as well as
improve clinicians’ understanding of their
local pathogen prevalences and resistance
patterns, which we believe are key to
selecting appropriate empiric antibiotic
therapy.

Research needed in this area. Rapid,

cost-effective, sensitive, and speciﬁc
diagnostic tests to identify organisms
causing CAP have potential to improve
routine care by supporting the use of
targeted therapy, especially when there
are risk factors for antibiotic-resistant
pathogens. All new diagnostic tests should
be assessed in high-quality research studies
that address the impact of testing strategies
on treatment decisions and patient
outcomes.

Question 2: In Adults with CAP,
Should Blood Cultures Be Obtained at
the Time of Diagnosis?

Recommendation. We recommend not
obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP
managed in the outpatient setting (strong
recommendation, very low quality of
evidence).

We suggest not routinely obtaining blood
cultures in adults with CAP managed in the
hospital setting (conditional recommendation,
very low quality of evidence).

We recommend obtaining

pretreatment blood cultures in adults with
CAP managed in the hospital setting who:
1. are classiﬁed as severe CAP (see Table 1)
(strong recommendation, very low
quality of evidence); or

2.

a. are being empirically treated for
MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong
recommendation, very low quality of
evidence); or

b. were previously infected with MRSA
or P. aeruginosa, especially those
with prior respiratory tract infection
(conditional recommendation, very
low quality of evidence); or

c. were hospitalized and received

parenteral antibiotics, whether during
the hospitalization event or not,
in the last 90 days (conditional
recommendation, very low quality of
evidence).
Summary of the evidence. There are no

high-quality studies that speciﬁcally
compared patient outcomes with and
without blood culture testing. One large
observational study found lower mortality
for hospitalized patients associated with
obtaining blood cultures at the time of
admission (20). Three subsequent (smaller)
observational studies found similar
associations between in-hospital mortality
and having blood cultures within 24 hours
of admission, but the results were not
statistically signiﬁcant (8, 21, 22).

The yield of blood cultures in most
series of adults with nonsevere CAP is low,
ranging from 2% (outpatients) to 9%
(inpatients) (14, 21, 23, 24); furthermore,
blood cultures rarely result in an
appropriate change in empiric therapy (25),
and blood specimens that include skin
contaminants can generate false-positive
test results. Growth of organisms such as
coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are
not recognized as CAP pathogens (26), may
lead to inappropriate antimicrobial use that
increases the risk for adverse drug effects.
A study of adults hospitalized with CAP
found blood cultures were associated with
a signiﬁcant increase in length of stay and
duration of antibiotic therapy (27). Given the
observational nature of these studies, it is
unknown whether the associations found with
blood cultures and patient outcomes were
causal or due to unmeasured confounding
factors, including severity of illness.

Rationale for the recommendation.
Although additional diagnostic information
could improve the quality of treatment
decisions, support for routine collection of
blood cultures is reduced by the low quality of
studies demonstrating clinical beneﬁt. Routinely
obtaining blood cultures may generate false-
positive results that lead to unnecessary
antibiotic use and increased length of stay.

In severe CAP, delay in covering less-

common pathogens can have serious
consequences. Therefore, the potential beneﬁt
of blood cultures is much larger when results
can be returned within 24 to 48 hours.

The rationale for the recommendation

for blood cultures in the setting of risk
factors for MRSA and P. aeruginosa is the
same as for sputum culture.

Question 3: In Adults with CAP,
Should Legionella and Pneumococcal
Urinary Antigen Testing Be Performed
at the Time of Diagnosis?

Recommendation. We suggest not
routinely testing urine for pneumococcal
antigen in adults with CAP (conditional
recommendation, low quality of
evidence), except in adults with severe
CAP (conditional recommendation, low
quality of evidence).

We suggest not routinely testing urine

for Legionella antigen in adults with CAP
(conditional recommendation, low quality
of evidence), except

in cases where indicated by
epidemiological factors, such as
association with a Legionella outbreak
or recent travel (conditional
recommendation, low quality of

2.

in adults with severe CAP (see Table 1)
(conditional recommendation, low
quality of evidence).

We suggest testing for Legionella

urinary antigen and collecting lower
respiratory tract secretions for Legionella
culture on selective media or Legionella
nucleic acid ampliﬁcation testing in
adults with severe CAP (conditional
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Summary of the evidence. Falguera and
colleagues (28) randomized 177 patients to
pathogen-directed treatment (targeted
treatment) on the basis of results of urinary
antigen testing for S. pneumoniae and
Legionella versus empirical guideline-
directed treatment. Of the 88 patients in the
targeted treatment arm, 25% had a positive
urinary antigen test and received pathogen-
directed therapy. There were no statistical
differences in death, clinical relapse, ICU
admission, length of hospitalization, or

length of antibiotic treatment (28). A
second trial of 262 patients included
a broader range of microbiological testing
(sputum and blood cultures) and only
Legionella urinary antigen testing, but
patients receiving pathogen-directed
therapy had similar clinical outcomes to
patients receiving empirical, guideline-
directed therapy, including mortality, rates
of clinical failure, and length of
hospitalization (10).

One observational study evaluated cost
and antibiotic selection in patients during
two time periods, with and without
pneumococcal urinary antigen testing, but
found no differences during the two
time periods (29). In contrast, other
observational studies that have evaluated
the impact of prior CAP guideline
concordance (including initial diagnostic
testing with urinary antigen tests and
blood cultures, along with site of care

stratiﬁcation and guideline-concordant
therapy) have reported reduced mortality
for patients receiving prior CAP guideline-
concordant care, including diagnostic
testing. Costantini and colleagues reported
a 57% statistically signiﬁcant reduced odds
of in-hospital mortality for patients
receiving pneumococcal and Legionella
urinary antigen testing compared with
patients not tested, adjusting for baseline
demographic and clinical differences (27).
Uematsu and colleagues reported 25%
reduced odds of 30-day mortality in patients
receiving urinary antigen tests but no impact
on length of hospitalizations (7). However,
neither study distinguished whether the
mortality beneﬁts attributed to testing were
a direct consequence of the test results or
a marker of other improved processes of care.
Rationale for the recommendation.

Randomized trials have failed to identify
a beneﬁt for urinary antigen testing for S.
pneumoniae and Legionella. Concern has
also been raised that narrowing therapy in
response to positive urinary antigen tests
could lead to increased risk of clinical
relapse (28). In large observational studies,
these diagnostic tests have been associated
with reduction in mortality; therefore, we
recommend testing in patients with severe

disease. An increase in Legionella infections
in the United States in the past decade
highlights the importance of this diagnosis
especially among severely ill patients,
particularly in the setting of potential
outbreaks due to a common source, although
most cases are not associated with a known
outbreak and remain sporadic (30, 31).

Research needed in this area. Newer

nucleic acid ampliﬁcation systems for
sputum, urine, and blood are being developed
and require rigorous testing to assess the
impact on treatment decisions and clinical
outcomes for patients with CAP, as well as
the public health beneﬁt in terms of
prevention of additional cases and informing
primary prevention strategies. In particular,
we acknowledge the emergence of rapid, low-
cost genomic sequence detection assays that
have the potential to greatly improve
pathogen-directed therapy and thereby
improve antimicrobial stewardship.

Question 4: In Adults with CAP,
Should a Respiratory Sample Be
Tested for Inﬂuenza Virus at the Time
of Diagnosis?

Recommendation. When inﬂuenza viruses
are circulating in the community, we

recommend testing for inﬂuenza with
a rapid inﬂuenza molecular assay
(i.e., inﬂuenza nucleic acid ampliﬁcation
test), which is preferred over a rapid
inﬂuenza diagnostic test (i.e., antigen test)
(strong recommendation, moderate quality
of evidence).

Summary of the evidence. Rapid
inﬂuenza tests have become increasingly
available, moving from earlier antigen-based
detection tests to nucleic acid ampliﬁcation
tests. We were unable to identify any studies
that evaluated the impact of inﬂuenza
testing on outcomes in adults with CAP.
In contrast, a substantial literature has
evaluated the importance of inﬂuenza
testing in the general population, speciﬁcally
among patients with inﬂuenza-like illness
(32). Our recommendations for inﬂuenza
testing in adults with CAP are consistent
with testing recommendations for the
broader population of adults with suspected
inﬂuenza, as summarized in the recent
IDSA Inﬂuenza Clinical Practice Guideline
(33).

Rationale for the recommendation. The
beneﬁts of antiviral therapy support testing
of patients during periods of high inﬂuenza
activity. During periods of low inﬂuenza
activity, testing can be considered but
may not be routinely performed. Of note,
this testing recommendation has both
therapeutic and infection-control
implications in the hospital setting. Updated

Question 5: In Adults with CAP,
Should Serum Procalcitonin plus
Clinical Judgment versus Clinical
Judgment Alone Be Used to Withhold
Initiation of Antibiotic Treatment?

Recommendation. We recommend that
empiric antibiotic therapy should be
initiated in adults with clinically suspected
and radiographically conﬁrmed CAP
regardless of initial serum procalcitonin
level (strong recommendation, moderate
quality of evidence).

Summary of the evidence. Several

studies have assessed the ability of
procalcitonin to distinguish acute
respiratory infections due to pneumonia
(which are of viral or bacterial etiology)
from acute bronchitis or upper respiratory
tract infections (which are almost

exclusively viral in etiology). However, for
the purposes of this guideline, the question
is whether, among patients with clinically
conﬁrmed CAP, measurement of
procalcitonin can distinguish patients with
viral versus bacterial etiologies and guide the
need for initial antibiotic therapy. Some
investigators have suggested that
procalcitonin levels of <0.1 mg/L indicate
a high likelihood of viral infection, whereas
levels >0.25 mg/L indicate a high likelihood
of bacterial pneumonia (34–36). However,
a recent study in hospitalized patients with
CAP failed to identify a procalcitonin
threshold that discriminated between viral
and bacterial pathogens, although higher
procalcitonin strongly correlated with
increased probability of a bacterial infection
(37). The reported sensitivity of
procalcitonin to detect bacterial infection
ranges from 38% to 91%, underscoring that
this test alone cannot be used to justify
withholding antibiotics from patients with
CAP (38).

Rationale for the recommendation.

Procalcitonin has been used to guide
initiation of antibiotics in patients with
lower respiratory infections, but many of
these studies are not restricted to patients
with radiographically conﬁrmed
pneumonia. Some patients with low
procalcitonin levels have CAP and have
been safely treated without antibiotics (35),
but these represent small subgroups, raising
concerns about the safety of widely using
such a strategy.

Research needed in this area. Given the
epidemiological evidence that viruses are an
important cause of CAP, there is a critical
need to validate the use of current rapid
laboratory tests, including point-of-care
tests, to accurately identify situations in
which antibacterial therapy can be safely
withheld among adults with CAP.

Question 6: Should a Clinical
Prediction Rule for Prognosis plus
Clinical Judgment versus Clinical
Judgment Alone Be Used to
Determine Inpatient versus
Outpatient Treatment Location for
Adults with CAP?

Recommendation. In addition to clinical
judgement, we recommend that clinicians
use a validated clinical prediction rule
for prognosis, preferentially the
Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (strong
recommendation, moderate quality of

evidence) over the CURB-65 (tool based
on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate,
blood pressure, and age >65) (conditional
recommendation, low quality of evidence),
to determine the need for hospitalization in
adults diagnosed with CAP.

Summary of the evidence. Both the PSI
and CURB-65 were developed as prognostic
models in immunocompetent patients with
pneumonia, using patient demographic and
clinical variables from the time of diagnosis
to predict 30-day mortality (39, 40). When
compared with CURB-65, PSI identiﬁes
larger proportions of patients as low risk
and has a higher discriminative power in
predicting mortality (41).

Two multicenter, cluster-randomized

trials demonstrated that use of the PSI safely
increases the proportion of patients who can
be treated in the outpatient setting (42, 43).
These trials and one additional randomized
controlled trial (RCT) support the safety of
using the PSI to guide the initial site of
treatment of patients without worsening
mortality or other clinically relevant
outcomes (42–44). Consistent evidence
from three pre–post intervention
studies and one prospective controlled
observational study support the
effectiveness and safety of using the PSI to
guide the initial site of treatment (45–48).
Clinical severity is not the only
consideration in determining the need for
hospital admission (49, 50). Some patients
have medical and/or psychosocial
contraindications to outpatient therapy,
such as inability to maintain oral intake,
history of substance abuse, cognitive
impairment, severe comorbid illnesses, and
impaired functional status.

The PSI may underestimate illness

severity among younger patients and
oversimplify how clinicians interpret
continuous variables (e.g., all systolic blood
pressures ,90 mm Hg are considered
abnormal, regardless of the patient’s
baseline and actual measurement).
Therefore, when used as a decision aid, the
PSI should be used in conjunction with
clinical judgment.

In comparison to the PSI, there is less

evidence that CURB-65 is effective as
a decision aid in guiding the initial site of
treatment. One pre–post, controlled
intervention study using an electronically
calculated version of CURB-65,
PaO2/FIO2
effusion, and fewer than three minor ATS
severity criteria observed no signiﬁcant

, 300, absence of pleural

increase in the use of outpatient treatment
for adults with CAP (51). A randomized
trial compared the safety of inpatient versus
outpatient treatment of 49 patients with
CURB-65 scores of less than 2 (52) but had
limited power to detect differences in
patient outcomes; furthermore, outpatient
treatment included daily nursing visits and
parenteral antibiotic therapy that is
typically restricted to inpatient care.

Rationale for the recommendation. Our

recommendation to use the PSI as an
adjunct to clinical judgment to guide the
initial site of treatment is based on
consistent evidence of the effectiveness and
safety of this approach. Using a safe and
effective decision aid to increase outpatient
treatment of patients with CAP has potential
to decrease unnecessary variability in
admission rates, the high cost of inpatient
pneumonia treatment (53, 54), and the
risk of hospital-acquired complications.
Providing a conditional recommendation
to use CURB-65 considers its greater
simplicity of use relative to the PSI despite
the paucity of evidence regarding its
effectiveness or safety.

Research needed in this area. It is
important to study the effectiveness and
safety of using CURB scores or new
prediction rules for prognosis as decision
aids to guide the initial site of treatment for
patients with CAP compared with the PSI.
Future studies of prediction rules should
also test electronic versions generated in real
time from data routinely recorded in the
electronic medical record and assess their
performance in patient populations
excluded from the development of existing
prediction rules (55, 56).

Question 7: Should a Clinical
Prediction Rule for Prognosis plus
Clinical Judgment versus Clinical
Judgment Alone Be Used to
Determine Inpatient General Medical
versus Higher Levels of Inpatient
Treatment Intensity (ICU, Step-
Down, or Telemetry Unit) for
Adults with CAP?

Recommendation. We recommend direct
admission to an ICU for patients with
hypotension requiring vasopressors or
respiratory failure requiring mechanical
ventilation (strong recommendation, low
quality of evidence).

For patients not requiring vasopressors
or mechanical ventilator support, we suggest

e52

using the IDSA/ATS 2007 minor severity
criteria (Table 1) together with clinical
judgment to guide the need for higher levels
of treatment intensity (conditional
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Summary of the evidence. The PSI and
CURB-65 were not designed to help select
the level of care needed by a patient who is
hospitalized for CAP. Several prognostic
models have been designed to predict the
need for higher levels of inpatient treatment
intensity using severity-of-illness
parameters based on patient outcomes (ATS
2001, IDSA/ATS 2007, SMART-COP, and
SCAP score). Studies of prognostic models
have used different end points, including
inpatient mortality (57, 58), ICU admission
(57–59), receipt of intensive respiratory or
vasopressor support (59, 60), or ICU
admission plus receipt of a critical therapy
(61). In comparative studies, these
prognostic models yield higher overall
accuracy than the PSI or CURB-65 when
using illness outcomes other than mortality
(58, 59, 61).

The 2007 IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines

recommended a set of two major and nine
minor criteria to deﬁne severe pneumonia
requiring ICU admission (Table 1). These
criteria were based on empirical evidence
from published studies and expert
consensus. All elements are routinely
available in emergency department settings
and are electronically calculable (51, 61).
Several groups have validated these criteria
in pneumonia cohorts from different
countries (57–59, 61), with a meta-analysis
reporting one major or three minor criteria
had a pooled sensitivity of 84% and
a speciﬁcity of 78% for predicting ICU
admission (62). Without the major criteria,
a threshold of three or more minor criteria
(recommended in the 2007 IDSA/ATS
guideline) had a pooled sensitivity of 56%
and speciﬁcity of 91% for predicting ICU
admission (63).

SMART-COP is an alternative,
validated prediction rule for identifying
patients with pneumonia who need
vasopressor support and/or mechanical
ventilation. The eight SMART-COP criteria
and the nine 2007 IDSA/ATS minor criteria
have ﬁve overlapping elements: hypoxia,
confusion, respiratory rate, multilobar
radiographic opacities, and low systolic
blood pressure. SMART-COP had a pooled
sensitivity of 79% and speciﬁcity of 64% in
predicting ICU admission using a threshold
of three or more criteria but uses albumin,

PaO2, and pH, which are not universally
available for real-time clinical decision-
making (60). For predicting ICU admission,
one comparison reported equivalence of the
IDSA/ATS minor criteria and SMART-
COP (63) and another reported
a signiﬁcantly greater performance of the
IDSA/ATS minor criteria (61). No
randomized studies have evaluated the
effectiveness or safety of an illness severity
tool as a decision aid to guide the intensity
of inpatient treatment for patients
hospitalized with CAP.

Rationale for the recommendation.

Patients transferred to an ICU after
admission to a hospital ward experience
higher mortality than those directly
admitted to the ICU from an emergency
department (64–67). This higher mortality
may in part be attributable to progressive
pneumonia, but “mis-triage” of patients
with unrecognized severe pneumonia may
be a contributing factor (64). It seems
unlikely that physician judgment alone
would be equivalent to physician judgment
together with a severity tool to guide the
site-of-care decision. We recommend the
2007 IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria over
other published scores, because they are
composed of readily available severity
parameters and are more accurate than the
other scores described above.

Research needed in this area.

Controlled studies are needed to study the
effectiveness and safety of using illness
severity tools as decision aids to guide the
intensity of treatment in adults hospitalized
for pneumonia.

Question 8: In the Outpatient Setting,
Which Antibiotics Are Recommended
for Empiric Treatment of CAP in
Adults?

Recommendation.
1. For healthy outpatient adults without

comorbidities listed below or risk factors
for antibiotic resistant pathogens, we
recommend (Table 3):
d amoxicillin 1 g three times daily

(strong recommendation, moderate
quality of evidence), or

d doxycycline 100 mg twice daily

(conditional recommendation, low
quality of evidence), or

d a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg on

ﬁrst day then 250 mg daily or
clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily or

clarithromycin extended release
1,000 mg daily) only in areas with
pneumococcal resistance to
macrolides ,25% (conditional
recommendation, moderate quality of
evidence).

2. For outpatient adults with comorbidities
such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or
renal disease; diabetes mellitus;
alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia we
recommend (in no particular order of
preference) (Table 3):
d Combination therapy:

B amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125
mg three times daily, or amoxicillin/
clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice
daily, or 2,000 mg/125 mg twice
daily, or a cephalosporin
(cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily or
cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily);
AND

B macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg
on ﬁrst day then 250 mg daily,
clarithromycin [500 mg twice daily
or extended release 1,000 mg once
daily]) (strong recommendation,
moderate quality of evidence for
combination therapy), or doxycycline
100 mg twice daily (conditional
recommendation, low quality of
evidence for combination therapy);
OR

d Monotherapy:

B respiratory ﬂuoroquinolone
(levoﬂoxacin 750 mg daily,
moxiﬂoxacin 400 mg daily, or
gemiﬂoxacin 320 mg daily) (strong
recommendation, moderate quality
of evidence).

Summary of the evidence. RCTs of
antibiotic treatment regimens for adults
with CAP provide little evidence of either
superiority or equivalence of one antibiotic
regimen over another, because of small
numbers and the rare occurrence of
important outcomes such as mortality
or treatment failure resulting in
hospitalization. Several published trials
included comparators that are no longer
available (e.g., ketolides). This paucity of
data was noted in a 2014 Cochrane review
(68).

We identiﬁed 16 relevant RCTs
comparing two antibiotic regimens for the
treatment of outpatient CAP (69–84). Meta-
analyses of each of these groups of studies
revealed no differences in relevant
outcomes between any of the compared
regimens. Similar ﬁndings have been

e53

reported in a 2008 meta-analysis of
antibiotic treatment for outpatient CAP (85).

assessing whether such an approach is
associated with improved outcomes.

The committee also considered

whether to accept data regarding oral
antibiotics given to inpatients with CAP. We
believed that this evidence, albeit indirect,
could be reasonably extended to outpatients,
because inpatients are generally higher risk
and more severely ill. As observational data
suggest that inpatient and outpatient CAP
are due to the same pathogens (69, 71–73,
82), except for Legionella and gram-negative
bacilli, which are rarely documented in
outpatient settings, it seems reasonable that
an antibiotic regimen that was effective for
inpatients would be effective for outpatients.
Studies of high-dose oral amoxicillin
have demonstrated efﬁcacy for inpatients
with CAP (86–88). Similarly, there is
evidence supporting amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid in outpatient CAP (71, 73) and
inpatient CAP (89, 90).

There are limited data regarding oral
doxycycline for pneumonia, mostly involving
small numbers of patients (81). Intravenous
doxycycline 100 mg twice daily compared
favorably to intravenous levoﬂoxacin 500 mg
daily in 65 in patients with CAP (91). In an
open-label randomized trial of intravenous
doxycycline 100 mg twice daily compared
with standard antibiotics, doxycycline was
associated with a quicker response and less
change in antibiotics (92).

Rationale for the recommendation. Given
the paucity of RCT data in the outpatient
setting, the committee considered all
available evidence. The data included the
few RCTs of outpatient CAP, observational
studies, RCTs of inpatient CAP treatment,
antimicrobial resistance data from
surveillance programs, and data regarding
antibiotic-related adverse events.

For patients without comorbidities that

increase the risk for poor outcomes, the
panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every
8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.
The recommendation for amoxicillin was
based on several studies that showed efﬁcacy
of this regimen for inpatient CAP despite
presumed lack of coverage of this antibiotic
for atypical organisms. This treatment also
has a long track record of safety. The
recommendation for doxycycline was based
on limited clinical trial data, but a broad
spectrum of action, including the most
common relevant organisms. Some experts
recommend that the ﬁrst dose of oral
doxycycline be 200 mg, to achieve adequate
serum levels more rapidly. There are no data

In a departure from the prior CAP
guidelines, the panel did not give a strong
recommendation for routine use of
a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for
outpatient CAP, even in patients without
comorbidities. This was based on studies
of macrolide failures in patients with
macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae (93, 94),
in combination with a macrolide resistance
rate of .30% among S. pneumoniae isolates
in the United States, most of which is high-
level resistance (95). However, in settings
where macrolide resistance is documented
to be low and there are contraindications
to alternative therapies, a macrolide as
monotherapy is a treatment option.

Patients with comorbidities should
receive broader-spectrum treatment for two
reasons. First, such patients are likely more
vulnerable to poor outcomes if the initial
empiric antibiotic regimen is inadequate.
Second, many such patients have risk factors
for antibiotic resistance by virtue of previous
contact with the healthcare system
and/or prior antibiotic exposure (see
Recommendation 10) and are therefore
recommended to receive broader-spectrum
therapy to ensure adequate coverage. In
addition to H. inﬂuenzae and M. catarrhalis
(both of which frequently produce
b-lactamase), S. aureus and gram-negative
bacilli are more common causes of CAP in
patients with comorbidities, such as COPD.

Regimens recommended for patients
with comorbidities include a b-lactam or
cephalosporin in combination with either
a macrolide or doxycycline. These
combinations should effectively target
macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant
S. pneumoniae (as b-lactam resistance in
S. pneumoniae remains less common), in
addition to b-lactamase–producing strains
of H. inﬂuenzae, many enteric gram-
negative bacilli, most methicillin-
susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae
and C. pneumoniae. The monotherapies
listed also are effective against most
common bacterial pathogens.

Both sets of treatment recommendations

contain multiple antibiotic options
without specifying a preference order.
The choice between these options requires
a risk–beneﬁt assessment for each individual
patient, weighing local epidemiological
data against speciﬁc risk factors that
increase the risk of individual choices,
such as documented b-lactam or macrolide

allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides),
vascular disease (ﬂuoroquinolones),
and history of infection with Clostridium
difﬁcile. In particular, despite the concern
regarding adverse events associated with
ﬂuoroquinolones, the panel believed that
ﬂuoroquinolone therapy was justiﬁed for
adults with comorbidities and CAP
managed in the outpatient setting.
Reasons included the performance of
ﬂuoroquinolones in numerous studies of
outpatient CAP (70, 72, 75, 77, 80, 83)
and inpatient CAP (see inpatient CAP
section), the very low resistance rates
in common bacterial causes of CAP,
their coverage of both typical and
atypical organisms, their oral bioavailability,
the convenience of monotherapy, and the
relative rarity of serious adverse events related
to their use. However, there have been
increasing reports of adverse events related to
ﬂuoroquinolone use as summarized on the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
website (96).

Of note, we adopt the convention of
prior guidelines to recommend that patients
with recent exposure to one class of antibiotics
recommended above receive treatment with
antibiotics from a different class, given
increased risk for bacterial resistance to the
initial treatment regimen. We also highlight
that although patients with signiﬁcant risk
factors for CAP due to MRSA or P. aeruginosa
(see Recommendation 11) are uncommonly
managed in the outpatient setting, these
patients may require antibiotics that include
coverage for these pathogens.

Research needed in this area. There is
a need for head-to-head prospective RCTs
of outpatient CAP treatment, comparing
clinical outcomes, including treatment
failure, need for subsequent visits,
hospitalization, time to return to usual
activities and adverse events. Furthermore,
the prevalence of speciﬁc pathogens and
their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in
outpatients with pneumonia should be
monitored. Newer agents, including
lefamulin and omadacycline, need further
validation in the outpatient setting.

Question 9: In the Inpatient Setting,
Which Antibiotic Regimens Are
Recommended for Empiric Treatment
of CAP in Adults without Risk Factors
for MRSA and P. aeruginosa?

Recommendation 9.1. In inpatient adults
with nonsevere CAP without risk factors for

e54

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Volume 200 Number 7 | October 1 2019

 AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY DOCUMENTS

MRSA or P. aeruginosa (see Recommendation
11), we recommend the following empiric
treatment regimens (in no order of
preference) (Table 4):
d combination therapy with a b-lactam
(ampicillin 1 sulbactam 1.5–3 g every
6 h, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 h,
ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline
600 mg every 12 h) and a macrolide
(azithromycin 500 mg daily or
clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily)
(strong recommendation, high quality of
evidence), or

d monotherapy with a respiratory

ﬂuoroquinolone (levoﬂoxacin 750 mg
daily, moxiﬂoxacin 400 mg daily) (strong
recommendation, high quality of
evidence).

A third option for adults with CAP who
have contraindications to both macrolides
and ﬂuoroquinolones is:
d combination therapy with a b-lactam
(ampicillin 1 sulbactam, cefotaxime,
ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone, doses as
above) and doxycycline 100 mg twice
daily (conditional recommendation, low
quality of evidence).

Summary of the evidence. Most

randomized controlled studies of
hospitalized adults with CAP comparing
b-lactam/macrolide therapy versus
ﬂuoroquinolone monotherapy were
designed as noninferiority trials and had
limited sample sizes (97–103). These data
suggested that patients treated with
b-lactam/macrolide therapy have similar
clinical outcomes compared with those
treated with ﬂuoroquinolone monotherapy.
A systematic review of 16 RCTs in 4,809
patients found ﬂuoroquinolone
monotherapy resulted in signiﬁcantly fewer
incidences of clinical failure, treatment
discontinuation, and diarrhea than
b-lactam/macrolide combination (104).
However, mortality rates were low overall,
and there were no signiﬁcant differences in
mortality between groups. Another
systematic review of 20 experimental and
observational studies in adults hospitalized
with radiographically conﬁrmed CAP,
b-lactam plus macrolide combination
therapy, or ﬂuoroquinolone monotherapy
were generally associated with lower
mortality than b-lactam monotherapy
(105). Therefore, the panel recommends
a b-lactam (ampicillin plus sulbactam,
cefotaxime, ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone) plus

macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin)
or monotherapy with a respiratory
ﬂuoroquinolone (levoﬂoxacin,
moxiﬂoxacin) for the management of
inpatients with nonsevere CAP. (Of note,
azithromycin but not clarithromycin is
available in parenteral formulation.) In
choosing between these two options,
clinicians should weigh the risks and
beneﬁts of the drugs, particularly in light of
individual risk factors, such as a history of
C. difﬁcile infection or risk factors related to
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
warnings (96). The panel recommends
using doxycycline as an alternative to
a macrolide in combination with a b-
lactam as a third option in the presence of
documented allergies or contraindications
to macrolides or ﬂuoroquinolones or
clinical failure on one of those agents. Of
note, a newer member of the tetracycline
class, omadacycline, was recently reported
to be equivalent to moxiﬂoxacin as
monotherapy for adults with nonsevere
CAP and is effective in the setting of
tetracycline resistance (106). However, as
this is a single published report and the
safety information is less well established,
the committee decided to not list this new
agent as an alternative to the currently
recommended treatment options.

The panel also considered b-lactam
monotherapy as an option for inpatients
with nonsevere CAP. An RCT in 580
patients with CAP could not rule out the
possibility that b-lactam monotherapy was
inferior to b-lactam/macrolide therapy for
inpatients with CAP (107). Nie and
colleagues identiﬁed several cohort (n = 4)
and retrospective observational (n = 12)
studies addressing this question and found
that b-lactam/macrolide therapy reduced
mortality in patients with CAP compared
with patients treated with b-lactam
monotherapy (108). Similarly, Horita
and colleagues demonstrated that
b-lactam/macrolide combinations may
decrease all-cause death, but mainly for
patients with severe CAP (109). Therefore,
we suggest that b-lactam monotherapy
should not be routinely used for inpatients
with CAP over ﬂuoroquinolone
monotherapy or b-lactam/macrolide
combination therapy.

Rationale for the recommendation. As

summarized in Table 4, the empiric
antibiotic coverage recommendations for
patients hospitalized with CAP remain
aligned to cover the most likely pathogens

causing CAP. There is a paucity of RCTs to
favor the recommendation of combination
b-lactam plus macrolide versus
monotherapy with a respiratory
ﬂuoroquinolone versus combined therapy
with b-lactam plus doxycycline.

Research needed in this area. There is

a need for higher-quality evidence in
support of the use of combination therapy
with a b-lactam and doxycycline. Given
concerns over increasing drug resistance
(macrolides) and safety issues (macrolides,
ﬂuoroquinolones), there is a need for
research on new therapeutic agents for
adults with CAP including omadacycline
(see above) and lefamulin, a new
pleuromutilin antibiotic that was recently
demonstrated to be noninferior to
moxiﬂoxacin in hospitalized adult patients
with CAP (110).

Recommendation 9.2. In inpatient
adults with severe CAP (see Table 1)
without risk factors for MRSA or P.
aeruginosa, we recommend (Table 4) (note,
speciﬁc agents and doses are the same as
9.1):
d a b-lactam plus a macrolide (strong

recommendation, moderate quality of
evidence); or

d a b-lactam plus a respiratory
ﬂuoroquinolone (strong
recommendation, low quality of
evidence).

Summary of the evidence. In the
absence of RCTs evaluating therapeutic
alternatives in severe CAP, the evidence is
from observational studies that used
different deﬁnitions of illness severity to
address this question. Sligl and colleagues
found in a meta-analysis of observational
studies with almost 10,000 critically ill
patients with CAP that macrolide-
containing therapies (often in combination
with a b-lactam) were associated with
a signiﬁcant mortality reduction (18%
relative risk, 3% absolute risk) compared
with non–macrolide-containing therapies
(111). A mortality beneﬁt from macrolides
has been observed mainly in cohorts
with a large number of patients with
severe CAP. In a systematic review,
Vardakas and colleagues compared a
b-lactam/ﬂuoroquinolone versus a
b-lactam/macrolide combination for the
treatment of patients with CAP (112). The
authors found 17 observational studies and
no RCTs addressing this comparison. The
combination of b-lactam/ﬂuoroquinolone

American Thoracic Society Documents

e55

 AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY DOCUMENTS

therapy was associated with higher
mortality than b-lactam/macrolide
combination therapy, but the overall quality
of the studies was judged to be low,
precluding a deﬁnitive recommendation
(112).

Rationale for the recommendation. In

the absence of data from clinical trials
demonstrating the superiority of any
speciﬁc regimen for patients with severe
CAP, the committee considered
epidemiological data for severe CAP
pathogens and observational studies
comparing different regimens. As a result,
we recommend that combination therapy
with a b-lactam plus a macrolide or a b-
lactam plus a respiratory ﬂuoroquinolone
should be the treatment of choice for
patients with severe CAP. Both
ﬂuoroquinolone monotherapy and the
combination of b-lactam plus
doxycycline have not been well studied in
severe CAP and are not recommended as
empiric therapy for adults with severe
CAP.

Research needed in this area. Future

well-designed RCTs should focus on
therapies for patients at highest risk of
death with severe pneumonia, as these
are needed to assess the beneﬁts and
risks of combination b-lactam and
macrolide therapy compared with
b-lactam and respiratory ﬂuoroquinolone
therapy. Studies of ﬂuoroquinolone
monotherapy in severe CAP are also needed.

Question 10: In the Inpatient Setting,
Should Patients with Suspected
Aspiration Pneumonia Receive
Additional Anaerobic Coverage
beyond Standard Empiric Treatment
for CAP?

Recommendation. We suggest not routinely
adding anaerobic coverage for suspected
aspiration pneumonia unless lung abscess or
empyema is suspected (conditional
recommendation, very low quality of
evidence).

Summary of the evidence. Aspiration is
a common event, and as many as half of all
adults aspirate during sleep (113). As
a result, the true rate of aspiration
pneumonia is difﬁcult to quantify, and
there is no deﬁnition that separates patients
with aspiration pneumonia from all others
diagnosed with pneumonia. Some have
estimated that 5% to 15% of pneumonia

hospitalizations are associated with
aspiration (114). Rates are higher in
populations admitted from nursing homes
or extended care facilities (115).

Patients who aspirate gastric contents

are considered to have aspiration
pneumonitis. Many of these patients have
resolution of symptoms within 24 to
48 hours and require only supportive
treatment, without antibiotics (116).

Studies evaluating the microbiology of
patients with aspiration pneumonia in the
1970s showed high rates of isolation of
anaerobic organisms (117, 118); however,
these studies often used trans-tracheal
sampling and evaluated patients late in
their disease course, two factors that may
have contributed to a higher likelihood of
identifying anaerobic organisms (114).
Several studies of acute aspiration events in
hospitalized patients have suggested that
anaerobic bacteria do not play a major role
in etiology (119–121).

With increasing rates of C. difﬁcile
infections (frequently associated with use
of clindamycin), the question of adding
empiric anaerobic coverage (clindamycin
or b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors) in
addition to routine CAP treatment in
patients with suspected aspiration is an
important one. However, there are no
clinical trials comparing treatment
regimens with and without anaerobic
coverage for patients hospitalized with
suspected aspiration. Most recent studies
are small, retrospective, and provide only
observational data on microbiologic
patterns and treatment regimens for
patients hospitalized with suspected
aspiration pneumonia.

Rationale for the recommendation.
Although older studies of patients with
aspiration pneumonia showed high
isolation rates of anaerobic organisms,
more recent studies have shown that
anaerobes are uncommon in patients
hospitalized with suspected aspiration
(119, 120). Increasing prevalence of
antibiotic-resistant pathogens and
complications of antibiotic use
highlight the need for a treatment
approach that avoids unnecessary use
of antibiotics.

Research needed in this area. Clinical
trials evaluating diagnostic and treatment
strategies in patients with suspected
aspiration are needed, especially in terms of
the ability to distinguish micro- and macro-
aspiration events that lead to lower

respiratory tract infection from those that
do not result in infection.

Question 11: In the Inpatient Setting,
Should Adults with CAP and Risk
Factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa Be
Treated with Extended-Spectrum
Antibiotic Therapy Instead of
Standard CAP Regimens?

Recommendation. We recommend
abandoning use of the prior categorization of
healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to
guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage
in adults with CAP (strong recommendation,
moderate quality of evidence).

We recommend clinicians only cover
empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in
adults with CAP if locally validated risk
factors for either pathogen are present
(strong recommendation, moderate quality
of evidence). Empiric treatment options for
MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg
every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or
linezolid (600 mg every 12 h). Empiric
treatment options for P. aeruginosa include
piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h),
cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g
every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h),
meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem
(500 mg every 6 h).

If clinicians are currently covering
empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in
adults with CAP on the basis of published
risk factors but do not have local etiological
data, we recommend continuing empiric
coverage while obtaining culture data to
establish if these pathogens are present to
justify continued treatment for these
pathogens after the ﬁrst few days of empiric
treatment (strong recommendation, low
quality of evidence).

Summary of the evidence. HCAP, as
a distinct clinical entity warranting unique
antibiotic treatment, was incorporated into
the 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines for
management of hospital-acquired and
ventilator-associated pneumonia (122).
HCAP was deﬁned for those patients who
had any one of several potential risk factors
for antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including
residence in a nursing home and other
long-term care facilities, hospitalization for
>2 days in the last 90 days, receipt of home
infusion therapy, chronic dialysis, home
wound care, or a family member with
a known antibiotic-resistant pathogen. The
introduction of HCAP was based on studies
identifying a higher prevalence of

e56

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Volume 200 Number 7 | October 1 2019

 AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY DOCUMENTS

pathogens that are not susceptible to
standard ﬁrst-line antibiotic therapy, in
particular MRSA and P. aeruginosa, in
some subsets of patients with CAP (123).
Since then, many studies have
demonstrated that the factors used to
deﬁne HCAP do not predict high
prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens
in most settings. Moreover, a signiﬁcant
increased use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics (especially vancomycin and
antipseudomonal b-lactams) has resulted,
without any apparent improvement in
patient outcomes (124–133).

Studies have identiﬁed risk factors for
antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and in some
cases the risk factors are distinct for MRSA
versus P. aeruginosa (134–154). However,
most of these individual risk factors are
weakly associated with these pathogens.
The most consistently strong individual risk
factors for respiratory infection with MRSA
or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these
organisms, especially from the respiratory
tract, and/or recent hospitalization and
exposure to parenteral antibiotics (134, 155,
156). Therefore, we have highlighted these
individual risk factors to help guide initial
microbiological testing and empiric
coverage for these pathogens.

Unfortunately, no validated scoring
systems exist to identify patients with MRSA
or P. aeruginosa with sufﬁciently high
positive predictive value to determine the
need for empiric extended-spectrum
antibiotic treatment. Scoring system
development and validation are complicated
by varying prevalence of MRSA and
P. aeruginosa in different study populations.
Moreover, no scoring system has been
demonstrated to improve patient outcomes
or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

Although there is limited evidence to

support the use of a speciﬁc set of risk
factors to identify patients with sufﬁciently
high risk of MRSA or P. aeruginosa to
warrant extended-spectrum therapy,
a stronger evidence base guides
deescalation of therapy after extended-
spectrum therapy is initially prescribed.
Although no randomized prospective
studies have been reported, recent
observational (157) and retrospective
(158–161) studies in patients with CAP
provide strong evidence that deescalation of
antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord
with microbiological results that do not
yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is safe and

reduces duration of antibiotic treatment,
length of hospitalization, and complications
of broad-spectrum therapy. These results are
reinforced by retrospective (162) and
prospective and randomized but not blinded
(163) studies of patients with severe sepsis,
the majority of whom had pneumonia, as
well as by a recent meta-analysis of
deescalation in adults with sepsis (164).
We propose that clinicians need to
obtain local data on whether MRSA or
P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with
CAP and what the risk factors for infection
are at a local (i.e., hospital or catchment
area) level. We refer to this process as “local
validation.” This recommendation is based
on the absence of high-quality outcome
studies, the very low prevalence of MRSA
or P. aeruginosa in most centers, and
signiﬁcant increased use of anti-MRSA and
antipseudomonal antibiotics for treatment
of CAP (142, 155, 165). Although we
acknowledge that centers may not currently
have local prevalence data, adopting the
recommendations for culture of sputum
and blood when risk factors for MRSA or P.
aeruginosa are present will enable clinicians
to generate these local data over time. We
recommend analyzing the frequency of
MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen
relative to the number of all cases of CAP,
not just those for whom cultures are sent.
Finally, routine cultures in patients
empirically treated for MRSA or P.
aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard
CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal
a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is
clinically improving at 48 hours.

Rationale for the recommendation. Our
approach to treating inpatient adults with
CAP is summarized in Table 4. Our
recommendation against using the former
category of HCAP as a basis for selecting
extended-spectrum therapy is based on
high-quality studies of patient outcomes.
Although we understand that clinicians
would prefer a simple rule that does not
require incorporating site-speciﬁc data, the
current evidence does not permit
endorsement of a simple and accurate rule
to determine which patients with CAP
should be covered for MRSA and/or P.
aeruginosa. However, the alternative
approach to MRSA and P. aeruginosa that
we propose as a replacement is not based
on high-quality studies, because such
studies do not exist. The lack of adequate
outcome data and marked variation
between sites in prevalence of MRSA and

P. aeruginosa make generalizing any ﬁndings
extremely difﬁcult. We hope that future
research will improve our understanding of
this challenging clinical problem.

Our ﬁrst principle was to maintain the

distinction between severe and nonsevere
pneumonia as per prior guidelines, because
the risk of inadequate empiric antibiotic
therapy is much greater in severe CAP. As
noted previously, severity is deﬁned by the
degree of physiological impairment, as
classiﬁed by the IDSA/ATS 2007 criteria.

The second principle was that there is
sufﬁcient evidence that prior identiﬁcation
of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory
tract within the prior year predicts a very
high risk of these pathogens being
identiﬁed in patients presenting with CAP
(139, 141, 143, 150, 155, 165), and therefore
these were sufﬁcient indications to
recommend blood and sputum cultures and
empiric therapy for these pathogens in
patients with CAP in addition to coverage
for standard CAP pathogens, with
deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are
negative. We endorse the empiric treatment
recommendations for MRSA and P.
aeruginosa provided by the 2016 Clinical
Practice Guideline from IDSA and ATS for
the management of adults with hospital-
acquired and ventilator-associated
pneumonia (166).

The major additional risk factors for
MRSA and P. aeruginosa identiﬁed in the
literature are hospitalization and parenteral
antibiotic exposure in the last 90 days
(136–138, 140, 142–151, 153). In patients
with recent hospitalization and exposure to
parenteral antibiotics, we recommend
microbiological testing without empiric
extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of
nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing
with extended-spectrum empiric therapy in
addition to coverage for standard CAP
pathogens for treatment of severe CAP, with
deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are
negative and the patient is improving.

The data supporting rapid MRSA nasal
testing are robust (167, 168), and treatment
for MRSA pneumonia can generally be
withheld when the nasal swab is negative,
especially in nonsevere CAP. However, the
positive predictive value is not as high;
therefore, when the nasal swab is positive,
coverage for MRSA pneumonia should
generally be initiated, but blood and
sputum cultures should be sent and therapy
deescalated if cultures are negative.
However, this latter strategy of deescalation

in the face of a positive nasal swab will vary
depending on the severity of CAP and the
local prevalence of MRSA as a pathogen.

Question 12: In the Inpatient Setting,
Should Adults with CAP Be Treated
with Corticosteroids?

Recommendation. We recommend not
routinely using corticosteroids in
adults with nonsevere CAP (strong
recommendation, high quality of evidence).
We suggest not routinely using
corticosteroids in adults with severe CAP
(conditional recommendation, moderate
quality of evidence).

We suggest not routinely using
corticosteroids in adults with severe
inﬂuenza pneumonia (conditional
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
We endorse the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign recommendations on the use of
corticosteroids in patients with CAP and
refractory septic shock (169).

Summary of the evidence. Two

randomized controlled studies of
corticosteroids used for treatment of CAP
have shown signiﬁcant reductions in
mortality, length of stay, and/or organ
failure. The ﬁrst study found a large
magnitude of mortality beneﬁt that has not
been replicated in other studies, raising
concerns that the results overestimated the
true effect (170). In the second study, there
were baseline differences in renal function
between groups (171). Other RCTs of
corticosteroids in the treatment of CAP
have not shown signiﬁcant differences in
clinically important endpoints. Differences
have been observed in the time to
resolution of fever and other features of
clinical stability, but these have not
translated into differences in mortality,
length of stay, or organ failure (172, 173).
Some (174, 175), but not all (176, 177),

meta-analyses of published corticosteroid
studies have shown a mortality beneﬁt in
patients with severe CAP, although no
consistent deﬁnition of disease severity was
used. Side effects of corticosteroids (on the
order of 240 mg of hydrocortisone per
day) include signiﬁcant increases in
hyperglycemia requiring therapy and
possible higher secondary infection rates
(178, 179). No reported study has shown
excess mortality in the corticosteroid-
treated group.

In pneumonia due to inﬂuenza, a meta-

analysis (180) of predominantly small

retrospective studies suggests that mortality
may be increased in patients who receive
corticosteroids. This ﬁnding might reﬂect
the importance of innate immunity in
defense against inﬂuenza as opposed to
bacterial pneumonia.

Rationale for the recommendation.
There are no data suggesting beneﬁt of
corticosteroids in patients with nonsevere
CAP with respect to mortality or organ
failure and only limited data in patients with
severe CAP. The risk of corticosteroids in
the dose range up to 240 mg of
hydrocortisone equivalent per day for
a maximum of 7 days is predominantly
hyperglycemia, although rehospitalization
rates may also be higher (176), and
more general concerns about greater
complications in the following 30 to 90
days have been raised (179). At least one
large trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01283009)
has been completed but not reported and
may further inform which subgroups of
patients beneﬁt from steroids. We also
endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign
recommendations on the use of steroids in
patients with septic shock refractory to
adequate ﬂuid resuscitation and
vasopressor support (169).

Of note, there is no intent that our
recommendations would override clinically
appropriate use of steroids for comorbid
diseases, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, asthma, and
autoimmune diseases, where corticosteroids
are supported as a component of treatment.
Research needed in this area. Large,
multicenter, randomized trials with well-
deﬁned inclusion and exclusion criteria and
measurement of multiple relevant clinical
outcomes are needed to deﬁne the subsets of
patients (if any) who beneﬁt or are
potentially harmed from corticosteroid
therapy. The trial should also make
extensive efforts to deﬁne causative
pathogens, to deﬁne whether there are
clear pathogen-speciﬁc indications or
contraindications for corticosteroid therapy
(especially disease due to S. pneumoniae
and inﬂuenza).

Question 13: In Adults with CAP Who
Test Positive for Inﬂuenza, Should the
Treatment Regimen Include Antiviral
Therapy?

Recommendation. We recommend that
antiinﬂuenza treatment, such as oseltamivir,
be prescribed for adults with CAP who test

positive for inﬂuenza in the inpatient
setting, independent of duration of illness
before diagnosis (strong recommendation,
moderate quality of evidence).

We suggest that antiinﬂuenza

treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP
who test positive for inﬂuenza in the
outpatient setting, independent of duration
of illness before diagnosis (conditional
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Summary of the evidence. No clinical
trials have evaluated the effect of treatment
with antiinﬂuenza agents in adults with
inﬂuenza pneumonia, and data are lacking
on the beneﬁts of using antiinﬂuenza agents
in the outpatient setting for patients with
CAP who test positive for inﬂuenza virus.
Several observational studies suggest that
treatment with oseltamivir is associated
with reduced risk of death in patients
hospitalized for CAP who test positive for
inﬂuenza virus (181, 182). Treatment
within 2 days of symptom onset or
hospitalization may result in the best
outcomes (183, 184), although there may be
beneﬁts up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms
begin (181, 185).

The use of antiinﬂuenza agents in the

outpatient setting reduces duration of
symptoms and the likelihood of lower
respiratory tract complications among
patients with inﬂuenza (186), with most
beneﬁt if therapy is received within
48 hours after onset of symptoms (187).

Rationale for the recommendation.

For inpatients, a substantial body of
observational evidence suggests that
giving antiinﬂuenza agents reduces
mortality risk in adults with inﬂuenza
infection. Although beneﬁts are strongest
when therapy is started within 48 hours of
symptom onset, studies also support starting
later (185). These data underlie our strong
recommendation for using antiinﬂuenza
agents for patients with CAP and inﬂuenza in
the inpatient setting, consistent with the
recently published IDSA Inﬂuenza Clinical
Practice Guideline (33).

Although we did not identify studies

that speciﬁcally evaluated antiinﬂuenza
agents for treating outpatients with CAP
who test positive for inﬂuenza, we make the
same recommendation as for inpatients, on
the basis of the inpatient data and on
outpatient data showing better time to
resolution of symptoms and prevention
of hospitalization among those with
inﬂuenza but without pneumonia. Our
recommendations are consistent with the

e58

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Volume 200 Number 7 | October 1 2019

 AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY DOCUMENTS

IDSA inﬂuenza guidelines, which were
recently released (33).

Research needed in this area.

Randomized controlled studies are needed to
support the recommendation for use of
antiinﬂuenza agents to treat for inﬂuenza
pneumonia in the outpatient setting. In
particular, knowing whether therapy is
valuable when started more the 48 hours after
symptom onset would help guide clinical
decision-making.

Question 14: In Adults with CAP Who
Test Positive for Inﬂuenza, Should the
Treatment Regimen Include
Antibacterial Therapy?

Recommendation. We recommend that
standard antibacterial treatment be initially
prescribed for adults with clinical and
radiographic evidence of CAP who test
positive for inﬂuenza in the inpatient
and outpatient settings (strong
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Summary of the evidence. Bacterial
pneumonia can occur concurrently with
inﬂuenza virus infection or present later as
a worsening of symptoms in patients who were
recovering from their primary inﬂuenza virus
infection. As many as 10% of patients
hospitalized for inﬂuenza and bacterial
pneumonia die as a result of their infection
(188). An autopsy series from the 2009 H1N1
inﬂuenza pandemic found evidence of bacterial
coinfection in about 30% of deaths (189).

S. aureus is one of the most common
bacterial infections associated with inﬂuenza
pneumonia, followed by S. pneumoniae, H.
inﬂuenzae, and group A Streptococcus; other
bacteria have also been implicated (188,
190–192). Given this spectrum of pathogens,
appropriate agents for initial therapy include
the same agents generally recommended for
CAP. Risk factors and need for empiric
coverage for MRSA would follow the
guidelines included earlier in this document.
Rapidly progressive severe pneumonia with
MRSA has been described in previously
healthy young patients, particularly in the
setting of prior inﬂuenza; however, it is
typically readily identiﬁed in the nares or
sputum and should be identiﬁed by following
the recommendations of earlier
recommendations in this guideline.

Rationale for the recommendation. The

recommendation to routinely prescribe
antibacterial agents in patients with
inﬂuenza virus infection and pneumonia
was based on evidence suggesting that

bacterial coinfections are a common and
serious complication of inﬂuenza, as well as
the inability to exclude the presence of
bacterial coinfection in a patient with CAP
who has a positive test for inﬂuenza virus.
Although low levels of biomarkers such as
procalcitonin decrease the likelihood that
patients have bacterial infections, these
biomarkers do not completely rule out
bacterial pneumonia in an individual patient
with sufﬁcient accuracy to justify initially
withholding antibiotic therapy, especially
among patients with severe CAP (37, 38, 193).
We have provided a strong recommendation
because of the signiﬁcant risk of treatment
failure in delaying appropriate antibacterial
therapy in patients with CAP. However in
patients with CAP, a positive inﬂuenza test,
no evidence of a bacterial pathogen
(including a low procalcitonin level), and
early clinical stability, consideration could be
given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic
treatment at 48 to 72 hours.

Research needed in this area. Randomized

controlled studies are needed to establish
whether antibacterial therapy can be
stopped at 48 hours for patients with
CAP who test positive for inﬂuenza and
have no biomarker (e.g., procalcitonin) or
microbiological evidence of a concurrent
bacterial infection.

Question 15: In Outpatient and
Inpatient Adults with CAP Who Are
Improving, What Is the Appropriate
Duration of Antibiotic Treatment?

Recommendation. We recommend that the
duration of antibiotic therapy should be
guided by a validated measure of clinical
stability (resolution of vital sign
abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate,
blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and
temperature], ability to eat, and normal
mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be
continued until the patient achieves stability
and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong
recommendation, moderate quality of
evidence).

Summary of the evidence. A small
number of randomized trials address the
appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy in
CAP, and randomized placebo-controlled
trials of high quality are mostly limited to
the inpatient setting. In these trials, no
difference was observed between 5
additional days of oral amoxicillin
compared with placebo in patients who had
clinically improved on 3 days of intravenous

amoxicillin (194), or between 2 days of
intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days
versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime (195).
Similar results were obtained with 5 days of
levoﬂoxacin 750 mg daily compared with
10 days of levoﬂoxacin 500 mg daily (196) and
5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared
with 10 days (197). Several recent meta-
analyses similarly demonstrate the efﬁcacy of
shorter courses of antibiotic therapy of 5 to
7 days (198–200).

Several studies have demonstrated that

the duration of antibiotic therapy can be
reduced in patients with CAP with the use of
a procalcitonin-guided pathway and serial
procalcitonin measurement compared with
conventional care, but in most cases the
average length of treatment was greatly in
excess of current U.S. standards of practice
as well as the recommendations of these
current guidelines. Concern has also been
raised that procalcitonin levels may not be
elevated when there is concurrent viral and
bacterial infection (201, 202) or with
important pathogens such as Legionella and
Mycoplasma spp (37, 201, 203). Serial
procalcitonin measurement is therefore
likely to be useful primarily in settings
where the average length of stay for
patients with CAP exceeds normal practice
(e.g., 5–7 d).

It is recognized that some patients do

not respond to a standard duration of
therapy. A variety of criteria for determining
clinical improvement have been developed
for patients with CAP and validated in
clinical trials, including resolution of vital
sign abnormalities (heart rate, respiratory
rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and
temperature), ability to eat, and normal
mentation (204). Failure to achieve clinical
stability within 5 days is associated with
higher mortality and worse clinical
outcomes (205–207). Such failure should
prompt assessment for a pathogen resistant
to the current therapy and/or complications
of pneumonia (e.g., empyema or lung
abscess) or for an alternative source of
infection and/or inﬂammatory response
(208, 209). When assessment of clinical
stability has been introduced into clinical
practice, patients have shorter durations of
antibiotic therapy without adverse impact
on outcome (210). All clinicians should
therefore use an assessment of clinical
stability as part of routine care of patients
with CAP.

Longer courses of antibiotic therapy

are recommended for 1) pneumonia

American Thoracic Society Documents

e59

 AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY DOCUMENTS

complicated by meningitis, endocarditis,
and other deep-seated infection; or 2)
infection with other, less-common
pathogens not covered in these guidelines
(e.g., Burkholderia pseudomallei,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis or endemic
fungi).

Rationale for the recommendation.

As recent data supporting antibiotic
administration for ,5 days are scant, on
a risk–beneﬁt basis we recommend treating
for a minimum of 5 days, even if the patient
has reached clinical stability before 5 days.
As most patients will achieve clinical
stability within the ﬁrst 48 to 72 hours,
a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be
appropriate for most patients. In switching
from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either
the same agent or the same drug class
should be used.

We acknowledge that most studies in

support of 5 days of antibiotic therapy
include patients without severe CAP, but we
believe these results apply to patients with
severe CAP and without infectious
complications. We believe that the duration
of therapy for CAP due to suspected or
proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa should be 7
days, in agreement with the recent hospital-
acquired pneumonia and ventilator-
associated pneumonia guidelines (166).

Research needed in this area. Controlled

studies are needed to establish the
duration of antibiotic therapy for adults
with complications of CAP, including
empyema, and adults with prolonged time
to achieving clinical stability.

Question 16: In Adults with CAP Who
Are Improving, Should Follow-up
Chest Imaging Be Obtained?

Recommendation. In adults with CAP
whose symptoms have resolved within 5 to
7 days, we suggest not routinely obtaining
follow-up chest imaging (conditional
recommendation, low quality of evidence).
Summary of the evidence. There are
limited data on the clinical usefulness of
reimaging patients with pneumonia. Most
available data have evaluated whether
reimaging patients detects lung malignancy
not recognized at the time of treatment for
pneumonia. Reported rates of malignancy in
patients recovering from CAP range from
1.3% to 4% (211–214). When unsuspected

nonmaligant pathology is included, the
rate of abnormal ﬁndings may reach 5%.

Almost all patients with malignancy in
reported series were smokers or ex-smokers.
One longer-term study found 9.2% of CAP
survivors in the Veterans Affairs system
(with a predominantly male population and
high smoking prevalence) had a new
diagnosis of cancer, with a mean time to
diagnosis of 297 days. However, only 27%
were diagnosed within 90 days of discharge
from hospital, suggesting the yield of routine
follow-up post discharge would be low
(215).

Rationale for the recommendation.

Available data suggest the positive yield
from repeat imaging ranges from 0.2% to
5.0%; however many patients with new
abnormalities in these studies meet criteria
for lung cancer screening among current or
past smokers (216).

Research needed in this area. Further
research may clarify subgroups of patients
who may beneﬁt from further radiological
assessment after initial therapy for
pneumonia.

Conclusions

Recommendations to help clinicians
optimize therapy for their patients with CAP
have been revised in light of new data.
Methods of quality improvement are critical
to the implementation of guideline
recommendations. It remains disappointing
how few key clinical questions have been
studied adequately enough to allow for
strong recommendations regarding the
standard of care. We hope that the research
priorities outlined in this document will
prompt new investigations addressing key
knowledge gaps.

Despite substantial concern over the

rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens,
most patients with CAP can be adequately
treated with regimens that have been
used for multiple decades. It is also true
that the subset of patients with CAP who
have signiﬁcant comorbidities and
frequent contact with healthcare
settings and antibiotics is increasing,
and, in some settings, the rates of
infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa
are high enough to warrant empiric
treatment.

Unfortunately, microbiological testing

has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and
affordable testing that results in proven
beneﬁt for patients with CAP in terms of
more rapid delivery of targeted therapy or
safe deescalation of unnecessary therapy.
Exceptions include rapid testing for MRSA
and inﬂuenza. Until we have such widely
available (and affordable) tests, therapy for
many or most patients with CAP will
remain empiric. Therefore, clinicians need
to be aware of the spectrum of local
pathogens, especially if they care for
patients at a center where infection with
antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as
MRSA and P. aeruginosa are more
common.

A difference between this guideline and
previous ones is that we have signiﬁcantly
increased the proportion of patients in
whom we recommend routinely obtaining
respiratory tract samples for microbiologic
studies. This decision is largely based on
a desire to correct the overuse of anti-MRSA
and antipseudomonal therapy that has
occurred since the introduction of the
HCAP classiﬁcation (which we recommend
abandoning) rather than high-quality
evidence. We expect this change will
generate signiﬁcant research to prove or
disprove the value of this approach. As
it is not possible to create a “one size
ﬁts all” schema for empiric therapy for
CAP, clinicians must validate any
approach taking into account their local
spectrum and frequency of resistant
pathogens, which is another driver for
recommending increased testing. We
similarly expect our move against
endorsing monotherapy with macrolides,
which is based on population resistance
data rather than high-quality clinical
studies, will generate future outcomes
studies comparing different treatment
strategies.

We hope that clinicians and researchers

will ﬁnd this guideline useful, but the
recommendations included here do not
obviate the need for clinical assessment and
knowledge to ensure each individual patient
receives appropriate and timely care.
However, this guideline delineates
minimum clinical standards that are
achievable and will help drive the best
patient outcomes on the basis of currently
available data. n
