The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes
the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the
components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to
evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an
interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of
Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA
standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for
ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice
Committee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers
who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES

Recommendations
9.1 Treat most adults with type 1 diabetes with continuous subcutaneous insulin in-
fusion or multiple daily doses of prandial (injected or inhaled) and basal insulin. A
9.2 For most adults with type 1 diabetes, insulin analogs (or inhaled insulin)
are preferred over injectable human insulins to minimize hypoglycemia risk. A
9.3 Early use of continuous glucose monitoring is recommended for adults
with type 1 diabetes to improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to
minimize hypoglycemia. B
9.4 Automated insulin delivery systems should be offered to all adults with
type 1 diabetes. A
9.5 To improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to minimize hypogly-
cemia risk, most adults with type 1 diabetes should receive education on how
to match mealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate intake and fat and protein in-
take. They should also be taught how to modify the insulin dose (correction
dose) based on concurrent glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day man-
agement, and anticipated physical activity. B
9.6 Insulin treatment plan and insulin-taking behavior should be reevaluated
at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted to incorporate spe-
ciﬁc factors that impact choice of treatment and ensure achievement of indi-
vidualized glycemic goals. E

Insulin Therapy
Insulin treatment is essential for individuals with type 1 diabetes because the hallmark
of type 1 diabetes is absent or near-absent b-cell function. In addition to hyperglycemia,

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

insulinopenia can contribute to other met-
abolic disturbances like hypertriglyceride-
mia and ketoacidosis as well as tissue
catabolism that can be life threatening.
Severe metabolic decompensation can be,
and was, mostly prevented with once- or
twice-daily insulin injections for the six or
seven decades after the discovery of insu-
lin. Over the past four decades, evidence
has accumulated supporting more inten-
sive insulin replacement, using multiple
daily injections of insulin or continuous
subcutaneous administration through an
insulin pump, as providing the best com-
bination of effectiveness and safety for
people with type 1 diabetes.

The Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive
therapy with multiple daily injections or
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
(CSII) reduced A1C and was associated
with improved long-term outcomes (1–3).
The study was carried out with short-acting
(regular) and intermediate-acting (NPH)
human insulins. In this landmark trial,
lower A1C with intensive management
(7%) led to (cid:1)50% reductions in micro-
vascular complications over 6 years of
treatment. However, intensive therapy was
associated with a higher rate of severe
hypoglycemia than conventional treat-
ment (62 compared with 19 episodes per
100 person-years of therapy) (1). Follow-
up of participants from the DCCT demon-
strated fewer macrovascular and micro-
vascular complications in the group that
received intensive treatment. Achieving
intensive glycemic goals during the active
treatment period of the study had a per-
sistent beneﬁcial impact over the 20 years
after the active treatment component of
the study ended (1–3).

Insulin replacement plans typically con-
sist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, and
correction insulin (Fig. 9.1) (4). Basal insu-
lin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insu-
lin analogs, and continuous delivery of
rapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump.
Basal insulin analogs have longer duration
of action with ﬂatter, more constant and
consistent plasma concentrations and
activity proﬁles than NPH insulin; rapid-
acting analogs (RAA) have a quicker onset
and peak and shorter duration of action
than regular human insulin. In people
with type 1 diabetes, treatment with ana-
log insulins is associated with less hypo-
glycemia and weight gain and lower A1C
compared with injectable human insulins
(5–7). Two injectable ultra-rapid-acting

Figure 9.1—Choices of insulin plans in people with type 1 diabetes. Continuous glucose moni-
toring improves outcomes with injected or infused insulin and is superior to blood glucose
monitoring. Inhaled insulin may be used in place of injectable prandial insulin in the U.S. The
number of plus or dollar signs is an estimate of relative association of the plan with greater
ﬂexibility, lower risk of hypoglycemia, and higher costs between the different plans. LAA,
long-acting insulin analog; MDI, multiple daily injections; RAA, rapid-acting insulin analog;
URAA, ultra-rapid-acting insulin analog. Adapted from Holt et al. (4).

analog (URAA) insulin formulations are
available that contain excipients that ac-
celerate absorption and provide more ac-
tivity in the ﬁrst portion of their proﬁle
compared with the other RAA (8,9). In-
haled human insulin has a rapid peak and
shortened duration of action compared
with RAA (10) (see also subsection ALTERNA-
TIVE INSULIN ROUTES IN PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR
ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES). These newer for-
mulations may cause less hypoglycemia
while improving postprandial glucose
excursions and administration ﬂexibility (in
relation to prandial intake) compared with
RAA (10–12). In addition, longer-acting
basal analogs (U-300 glargine or deglu-
dec) may confer a lower hypoglycemia
risk compared with U-100 glargine in in-
dividuals with type 1 diabetes (13,14).

Despite the advantages of insulin ana-
logs in individuals with type 1 diabetes,
the expense and/or complexity of treat-
ment required for their use may be pro-
hibitive (Table 9.1). There are multiple
approaches to insulin treatment. The cen-
tral precept in the management of type 1
diabetes is that some form of insulin be

given in a deﬁned treatment plan tailored
to the individual to prevent diabetic ke-
toacidosis (DKA) and minimize clinically
relevant hypoglycemia while achieving the
individual’s glycemic goals. The impact of
the introduction of interchangeable biosi-
milars and unbranded versions of some
analog products as well as current and up-
coming price reductions on insulin access
need to be evaluated. Reassessment of in-
sulin-taking behavior and adjustment of
treatment plans to account for speciﬁc fac-
tors, including cost, that impact choice of
treatment is recommended at regular in-
tervals (every 3–6 months).

Most studies comparing multiple daily
injections with CSII have been relatively
small and of short duration. A systematic
review and meta-analysis concluded that
CSII via pump therapy has modest advan-
tages for lowering A1C ((cid:3)0.30% [95% CI
(cid:3)0.58 to (cid:3)0.02]) and for reducing severe
hypoglycemia rates in children and adults
(15). Use of CSII is associated with im-
provement in quality of life, particularly in
areas related to fear of hypoglycemia and
diabetes distress, compared with multiple

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

S185

daily injections of insulin (16,17). How-
ever, there is no consensus to guide the
choice of injection or pump therapy in a
given individual, and research to guide
this decision-making is needed (4). Inte-
gration of continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) into the treatment plan soon after
diagnosis improves glycemic outcomes,
decreases hypoglycemic events, and im-
proves quality of life for individuals with
type 1 diabetes (18–23). Its use is now
considered standard of care for most peo-
ple with type 1 diabetes (4) (see Section 7,
“Diabetes Technology”). Reduction of noc-
turnal hypoglycemia in individuals with
type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with
CGM is improved by automatic suspen-
sion of insulin delivery at a preset glucose
level, with further improvements when
using devices with predictive low-glucose
insulin delivery suspension (24,25).

Automated insulin delivery (AID) sys-
tems are safe and effective for people
with type 1 diabetes. Randomized con-
trolled trials and real-world studies have
demonstrated the ability of commercially
available systems to improve achievement
of glycemic goals while reducing the risk of
hypoglycemia (26–31). Data are emerging
on the safety and effectiveness of do-it-
yourself systems (32,33). Evidence sug-
gests that an AID hybrid closed-loop sys-
tem is superior to AID sensor-augmented
pump therapy for increased percentage
of time in range and reduction of hypogly-
cemia (34,35).

Intensive insulin management using a
version of CSII and CGM should be con-
sidered in individuals with type 1 diabetes
whenever feasible. AID systems are pre-
ferred and should be considered for indi-
viduals with type 1 diabetes who are
capable of using the device safely (either
by themselves or with a caregiver) to im-
prove time in range and reduce A1C and
hypoglycemia (26,28–31,36–42). When
choosing among insulin delivery systems,
individual preferences, cost, insulin type,
dosing plan, and self-management capabil-
ities should be considered. See Section 7,
“Diabetes Technology,” for a full discussion
of insulin delivery devices.

In general, individuals with type 1 dia-
betes require approximately 30–50% of
their daily insulin as basal and the remain-
der as prandial (43). This proportion de-
pends on several factors, including but
not limited to carbohydrate consumption,
age, pregnancy status, and puberty stage
(4,44–48). Total daily insulin requirements

can be estimated based on weight, with
typical doses ranging from 0.4 to 1 unit/
kg/day. Higher amounts may be required
during puberty, menses, and medical ill-
ness. The American Diabetes Association/
JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook notes
0.5 units/kg/day as a typical starting dose
in adults with type 1 diabetes who are
metabolically stable, with approximately
one-half administered as prandial insulin
given to manage blood glucose after meals
and the remaining portion as basal insulin
to manage glycemia in the periods be-
tween meal absorption (49). Starting doses
and those soon after diagnosis may be
higher, if an individual presents with ketoa-
cidosis, or lower (0.2–0.6 units/kg), particu-
larly in young children and those with
continued endogenous insulin production
(during the partial remission phase or
“honeymoon period,” or in people who
present with type 1 diabetes in adult-
hood) (49–51). This guideline provides
detailed information on intensiﬁcation
of therapy to meet individualized needs.
In addition, the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (ADA) position statement “Type 1
Diabetes Management Through the Life
Span” provides a thorough overview of
type 1 diabetes treatment (52).

Typical multidose treatment plans for
individuals with type 1 diabetes combine
premeal use of prandial insulins with a
longer-acting formulation. The long-acting
basal dose is titrated to regulate over-
night and fasting glucose. Postprandial
glucose excursions are best managed by a
well-timed injection or inhalation of pran-
dial insulin. Prandial insulin should ideally
be administered prior to meal consump-
tion; however, the optimal time to admin-
ister varies based on the pharmacokinetics
of the formulation (regular, RAA, or inhaled),
the premeal blood glucose level, and carbo-
hydrate consumption. Recommendations
for prandial
insulin dose administration
should therefore be individualized. Physi-
ologic insulin secretion varies with glyce-
mia, meal size, meal composition, and
tissue demand for glucose. To address
this variability in people treated with insu-
lin, strategies have evolved to adjust
prandial doses based on predicted needs.
Thus, education on how to adjust pran-
dial insulin to account for nutritional in-
take and the correction dose based on
premeal glucose levels, anticipated activ-
ity, and sick-day management can be ef-
fective and should be offered to most
individuals (53–58). Education regarding

insulin dose for
adjustment of prandial
glycemic trends should be provided to in-
dividuals who are using CGM alone or an
AID system (59–62). Further adjustment
of prandial insulin doses for nutritional in-
take of protein and fat, in addition to car-
bohydrates, is recommended but may be
more feasible for individuals using CSII
than for those using multiple daily injec-
tions (55). With some AID systems, use of
a simpliﬁed meal announcement method
may be an alternative for prandial insulin
dosing (31,63). Assessment and educa-
tion tailored to improve health literacy
and numeracy may be necessary for indi-
viduals to effectively use various insulin
dosing strategies and tools (64,65) (see
Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health
Behaviors and Well-being to Improve
Health Outcomes,” and Section 7, “Diabetes
Technology”).

The 2021 ADA/European Association
for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consen-
sus report on the management of type 1
diabetes in adults summarizes different in-
sulin plans and glucose monitoring strate-
gies in individuals with type 1 diabetes
(Fig. 9.1 and Table 9.1) (4).

Insulin Administration Technique
Ensuring that individuals and/or caregivers
understand correct insulin administration
technique is important to optimize glyce-
mic management and insulin use safety.
Recommendations have been published
elsewhere outlining best practices for in-
sulin administration (66). Proper insulin
administration technique includes the
following: injection, insertion of patch or
infusion (for CSII or AID systems) into ap-
propriate body areas, or oral inhalation
(inhaled human insulin); injection or in-
fusion site rotation; appropriate care of
injection or infusion sites to avoid infec-
tion or other complications; avoidance of
intramuscular (IM) insulin delivery; and
ﬁlling of the reservoir (for bolus patch,
CSII, or AID systems) or inhaler (for in-
haled human insulin) depending on the
method of administration. Selection of
method of administration (vial and sy-
ringe, insulin pen, insulin patch, inhaled
insulin, connected insulin pens/devices,
or insulin pumps) will depend on a vari-
individual-speciﬁc factors and
ety of
needs, cost and coverage, and individual
preferences. Reassessment of the appro-
priate administration technique should
be completed during routine follow-up.

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Exogenously delivered insulin should
be injected or infused into subcutaneous
tissue, not intramuscularly. Recommended
sites for insulin administration include the
abdomen, thigh, buttock, and upper arm.
Insulin absorption from IM sites differs
from that in subcutaneous sites and is also
inﬂuenced by the activity of the muscle.
Inadvertent IM injection can lead to un-
predictable insulin absorption and variable
effects on glucose and is associated with
frequent and unexplained hypoglycemia.
Risk for IM insulin delivery is increased in
younger, leaner individuals when injecting
into the limbs rather than truncal sites
(abdomen and buttocks) and when using
longer needles. Recent evidence supports
the use of short needles (e.g., 4-mm pen
needles) as effective and well tolerated
compared with longer needles, including
a study performed in adults with obesity
(67).

Injection or infusion site rotation is ad-
ditionally necessary to avoid lipohypertro-
phy, an accumulation of subcutaneous fat
in response to the adipogenic actions of
insulin at a site of multiple injections. Lipo-
hypertrophy appears as soft, smooth raised
areas several centimeters in breadth and
can contribute to erratic insulin absorption,
increased glycemic variability, and unex-
plained hypoglycemic episodes. People
treated with insulin and/or caregivers
should receive education about proper
injection or infusion site rotation and how
to recognize and avoid injecting in areas of
lipohypertrophy. As noted in Table 4.1, ex-
amination of insulin administration sites
for the presence of lipohypertrophy, as
well as assessment of administration de-
vice use and injection technique, are key
components of a comprehensive diabetes
medical evaluation and treatment plan.
Proper insulin injection, infusion, or inha-
lation technique may lead to more effec-
tive use of this therapy and, as such,
holds the potential for improved clinical
outcomes.

Noninsulin Treatments for Type 1
Diabetes
Injectable and oral noninsulin glucose-
lowering medications have been studied
for their efﬁcacy as adjuncts to insulin
treatment of type 1 diabetes. Pramlintide
is based on the naturally occurring b-cell
peptide amylin and is approved for use in
adults with type 1 diabetes. Clinical trials
have demonstrated a modest reduction
in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight

loss ((cid:1)1 kg) with pramlintide (68). Similar
results have been reported for several
agents currently approved only for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. The addi-
tion of metformin in adults with type 1
diabetes was associated with small re-
ductions in body weight,
insulin dose,
and lipid levels but did not sustainably
improve A1C (69,70). The largest clinical
trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor
agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes
have been conducted with liraglutide
1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest
A1C reductions ((cid:1)0.4%), decreases in
weight ((cid:1)5 kg), and reductions in insulin
doses (71,72). Liraglutide was also as-
sessed for impact on C-peptide in individu-
als with type 1 diabetes and residual
b-cell function. During treatment there
was no impact, and with liraglutide dis-
continuation there was worsening of C-
peptide loss compared with placebo
(73). Retrospective case series have re-
vealed potential beneﬁts on body weight
and glycemic metrics with addition of
semaglutide or tirzepatide for individuals
with type 1 diabetes and obesity (74,75).
Prospective studies using semaglutide
are ongoing (76,77).

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors have been studied in clinical
trials in people with type 1 diabetes, and
results showed improvements in A1C, re-
duced body weight, and improved blood
pressure (78); however, SGLT2 inhibitor
use in type 1 diabetes was associated
with an increased rate of DKA (79). The
SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliﬂozin has been
studied in clinical trials in people with
type 1 diabetes, and results showed im-
provements in A1C and body weight (80);
however, sotagliﬂozin use was associated
with an eightfold increase in DKA com-
pared with placebo (81). The studies that
led to the approved indication for heart
failure (HF) excluded individuals with type 1
diabetes or a history of DKA (82,83). See
SGLT INHIBITION AND RISK OF KETOSIS, later in this
section, and PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF
HEART FAILURE in Section 10, “Cardiovascular
Disease and Risk Management,” for infor-
mation on risk mitigation with the use of
SGLT inhibitors in those with type 1 dia-
betes. The risks and beneﬁts of adjunctive
agents continue to be evaluated, with
consensus statements providing guidance
on selection of candidates for treatment
and precautions (84).

There are currently no approved thera-
pies for preservation of C-peptide or

delaying the progression of symptomatic
type 1 diabetes. Higher C-peptide levels
have been associated with better A1C,
lower risk of retinopathy, lower risk of
nephropathy, and lower risk of severe
hypoglycemia (85). Various therapies,
including verapamil, menin inhibitors,
Janus kinase inhibitors, antithymocyte
globulin, several monoclonal antibodies
including teplizumab, and cell therapies,
are currently under active investigation.

gate microvascular complications of type 1
diabetes. However, people receiving these
treatments require lifelong immunosup-
pression to prevent graft rejection and/or
recurrence of autoimmune islet destruc-
tion. Given the potential adverse effects
of immunosuppressive therapy, pancreas
transplantation should be reserved for
people with type 1 diabetes undergoing
simultaneous kidney transplantation,
following kidney transplantation, or for
those with recurrent ketoacidosis or
severe hypoglycemia despite optimized
glycemic management (86). In much of
the world, allogenic islet transplantation
is regulated as an organ transplant. How-
ever, in the U.S., allogenic islet transplan-
tation is regulated as a cell therapy, and
the ﬁrst such allogeneic islet cell therapy,
donislecel-jujn, was approved in 2023.
Donislecel is indicated for the treatment
of adults with type 1 diabetes who are
unable to reach their A1C goals because of
repeated episodes of severe hypoglyce-
mia despite intensive diabetes manage-
ment and education (87). Alternative
islet sources are currently under active
investigation.

The 2021 ADA/EASD consensus report
on the management of type 1 diabetes in
adults offers a simpliﬁed overview of indi-
cations for b-cell replacement therapy in
people with type 1 diabetes (Fig. 9.2) (4).

Figure 9.2—Simpliﬁed overview of indications for b-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. The two main forms of b-cell replace-
ment therapy are whole-pancreas transplantation and islet cell transplantation. b-Cell replacement therapy can be combined with kidney trans-
plantation if the individual has end-stage kidney disease, which may be performed simultaneously or after kidney transplantation. All decisions
about transplantation must consider the surgical risk, metabolic need, and the choices of the individual with diabetes. GFR, glomerular ﬁltration

be included in the glucose-lowering
management of type 2 diabetes. A
9.8 A person-centered shared decision-
making approach should guide the
choice of glucose-lowering medica-
tions for adults with type 2 diabetes.
Use medications that provide sufﬁcient
effectiveness to achieve and maintain
intended treatment goals with consid-
eration of the effects on cardiovascu-
lar, kidney, weight, and other relevant
comorbidities; hypoglycemia risk; cost
and access; risk for adverse reactions
and tolerability; and individual prefer-
ences (Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2). E
9.9 Combination therapy can be con-
sidered in adults with type 2 diabetes
at treatment initiation to shorten time
to attainment of individualized treat-
ment goals. A
9.10 In adults with type 2 diabetes
and established or high risk of athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease, the
treatment plan should include medica-
tions with demonstrated beneﬁts to
reduce cardiovascular events
(e.g.,
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ago-
nist [GLP-1 RA] and/or sodium–glucose
cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitor) for

glycemic management and compre-
hensive cardiovascular risk reduction
(irrespective of A1C) (Fig. 9.3 and
Table 9.2). A
9.11 In adults with type 2 diabetes
who have heart failure (HF) (with either
reduced or preserved ejection fraction),
an SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended for
both glycemic management and pre-
vention of HF hospitalizations (irre-
spective of A1C) (Fig. 9.3). A
9.12 In adults with type 2 diabetes
and symptomatic heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
and obesity, a GLP-1 RA with dem-
onstrated beneﬁts for both glycemic
management and reduction of HF-
related symptoms (irrespective of A1C)
is recommended. A
9.13 In adults with type 2 diabetes
who have CKD (with conﬁrmed esti-
mated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR]
20–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or albu-
minuria), an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1
RA with demonstrated beneﬁt in this
population should be used for both
glycemic management (irrespective of
A1C) and for slowing progression of
CKD and reduction in cardiovascular

events (Fig. 9.3). The glycemic beneﬁts
of SGLT2 inhibitors are reduced at
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. A
9.14 In adults with type 2 diabetes and
advanced CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min/
1.73 m2), a GLP-1 RA is preferred for
glycemic management due to lower
risk of hypoglycemia and for cardio-
vascular event reduction. B
9.15 In adults with type 2 diabetes,
metabolic dysfunction–associated stea-
totic liver disease (MASLD), and over-
weight or obesity, consider using a
GLP-1 RA or a dual glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and
GLP-1 RA with potential beneﬁts in
metabolic dysfunction–associated stea-
for glycemic
tohepatitis (MASH)
management and as an adjunctive
to healthy interventions for weight
loss. B
9.16a In adults with type 2 diabetes
and biopsy-proven MASH or those at
high risk for liver ﬁbrosis (based on
noninvasive tests), pioglitazone, a GLP-1
RA, or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is
preferred for glycemic management
due to potential beneﬁcial effects on
MASH. B

9.16b Combination therapy with
pioglitazone plus a GLP-1 RA can be
considered for the treatment of hy-
perglycemia in adults with type 2
diabetes with biopsy-proven MASH
or those at high risk of liver ﬁbrosis
(identiﬁed with noninvasive tests)
due to potential beneﬁcial effects
on MASH. B
9.17 Medication plan and medication-
taking behavior should be reevalua-
ted at regular intervals (e.g., every
3–6 months) and adjusted as needed
to incorporate speciﬁc factors that
impact choice of treatment (Fig. 4.1
and Table 9.2). E
9.18 Treatment modiﬁcation (in-
tensiﬁcation or deintensiﬁcation)
for adults not meeting individual-
ized treatment goals should not be
delayed. A
9.19 Choice of glucose-lowering ther-
apy modiﬁcation should take into con-
sideration individualized glycemic and
weight goals, presence of comorbidities
(cardiovascular, kidney, liver, and other
metabolic comorbidities), and the risk
of hypoglycemia. A
9.20 When initiating a new glucose-
lowering medication, reassess the need
for and/or dose of medications with
higher hypoglycemia risk (i.e., sulfo-
nylureas, meglitinides, and insulin) to
minimize the risk of hypoglycemia
and treatment burden. A
9.21 Concurrent use of dipeptidyl pep-
tidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors with a GLP-1
RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is
not recommended due to lack of ad-
ditional glucose lowering beyond that
of a GLP-1 RA alone. B
9.22 In adults with type 2 diabetes
who have not achieved their individu-
alized weight goals, additional weight
management interventions (e.g.,
in-
tensiﬁcation of lifestyle modiﬁcations,
structured weight management pro-
grams, pharmacologic agents, or met-
abolic surgery, as appropriate) are
recommended. A
9.23 In adults with type 2 diabetes,
initiation of insulin should be consid-
ered regardless of background glucose-
lowering therapy or disease stage if
symptoms of hyperglycemia are pre-
sent or when A1C or blood glucose
levels are very high (i.e., A1C >10%
[>86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose
$300 mg/dL [$16.7 mmol/L]). E

9.24 In adults with type 2 diabetes
and no evidence of insulin deﬁciency,
a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and
GLP-1 RA,
is preferred to insulin
(Fig. 9.4). A
9.25 If insulin is used, combination ther-
apy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual
GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for
greater glycemic effectiveness as well
as beneﬁcial effects on weight and hy-
poglycemia risk for adults with type 2
diabetes. Insulin dosing should be re-
assessed upon addition or dose escala-
tion of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and
GLP-1 RA. A
9.26 In adults with type 2 diabetes
who are initiating insulin therapy, con-
tinue glucose-lowering agents (unless
contraindicated or not tolerated) for
ongoing glycemic and metabolic bene-
ﬁts (i.e., weight, cardiometabolic, or
kidney beneﬁts). A

A holistic, multifaceted, person-centered
approach that accounts for the complexity
of managing type 2 diabetes and its
complications across the life span is rec-
ommended. Person-speciﬁc factors that
affect choice of treatment include indi-
vidualized glycemic goals (see Section 6,
“Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia”), in-
dividualized weight goals (see Section 8,
“Obesity and Weight Management for
the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2
Diabetes”), the individual’s risk for hypo-
glycemia, and the individual’s history of
or risk factors for cardiovascular, kidney,
liver, and other comorbidities and com-
plications of diabetes (see Section 4,
“Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and
Assessment of Comorbidities,” Section 10,
“Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Man-
agement,” and Section 11, “Chronic Kid-
ney Disease and Risk Management”). In
addition, treatment decisions must con-
sider the tolerability and side effect pro-
ﬁles of medications, complexity of the
medication plan and the individual’s
capacity to implement it given their
speciﬁc situation and context, and the
access, cost, and availability of medica-
tions. Lifestyle modiﬁcations and health
behaviors that improve health (see Sec-
tion 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Be-
haviors and Well-being to Improve Health
Outcomes”) should be emphasized along
with any pharmacologic therapy. Section 13,
“Older Adults,” and Section 14, “Children
and Adolescents,” have recommendations

speciﬁc for older adults and for children
and adolescents with type 2 diabetes,
respectively. Section 10, “Cardiovascular
Disease and Risk Management,” and
Section 11, “Chronic Kidney Disease and
Risk Management,” have recommenda-
tions for the use of glucose-lowering
drugs in the management of cardio-
vascular disease and kidney disease,
respectively.

Choice of Glucose-Lowering Therapy
Healthy lifestyle behaviors, diabetes self-
management education and support
(DSMES), avoidance of therapeutic inertia,
and social determinants of health should
be considered in the glucose-lowering
management of type 2 diabetes. Phar-
macologic therapy should be guided by
person-centered treatment factors,
in-
cluding comorbidities, considerations of
adverse effects (including hypoglycemia)
and treatment burden, and treatment
goals and preferences. Shared decision-
making can be facilitated during clinical
encounters through use of decision aides
and has been shown to improve A1C in
adults with type 2 diabetes, though in
clinical trials the beneﬁts of shared deci-
sion-making were limited to face-to-face
discussions (not online encounters) and
to individuals with elevated A1C (>8%)
(88). Pharmacotherapy should be started
at the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed,
without delay, unless there are contrain-
dications. Medication plans should have
adequate efﬁcacy to achieve and main-
tain individualized treatment goals with
respect to glucose lowering, reduction of
cardiovascular and kidney disease risks,
weight management, and impacts on
other health conditions and treatment
burden. In adults with type 2 diabetes
and established or high risk of atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), HF,
and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the
treatment plan should include agents
that reduce cardiovascular and kidney
disease risk (Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2) (see
also Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease
and Risk Management,” and Section 11,
“Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk
Management”).

In individuals without ASCVD, HF, or
CKD, choice of therapy should be informed
by considerations of weight management
(see Section 8, “Obesity and Weight Man-
agement for the Prevention and Treat-
ment of Type 2 Diabetes”), mitigation of

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

metabolic dysfunction–associated liver dis-
ease (MASLD) or metabolic dysfunction–
associated steatohepatitis (MASH) risk (see
Section 4, “Comprehensive Medical Evalu-
ation and Assessment of Comorbidities”),
and achievement and maintenance of
individualized glycemic goals. In general,
higher-efﬁcacy approaches,
including
combination therapy, have greater likeli-
hood of achieving treatment goals. Weight
management is a distinct treatment goal,
along with glycemic management, as it
has multifaceted beneﬁts, including reduc-
tion of A1C, reduction in hepatic steatosis,
and improvement in cardiovascular risk
factors (89–91). For individuals with type 2
diabetes who require initiation or intensi-
ﬁcation of glucose-lowering therapy to
achieve and/or maintain individualized
glycemic goals and who do not have addi-
tional considerations informing choice of
therapy beyond need for glucose lower-
ing, metformin is a commonly used
medication that historically has been the
ﬁrst-line treatment for type 2 diabetes
(92,93). Metformin is effective and safe,
is inexpensive and widely available, and
reduces risks of microvascular complica-
tions, cardiovascular events, and death
(92,94,95). Metformin is available in an
immediate-release form for twice-daily
dosing or as an extended-release form
that can be given once daily. Compared
with sulfonylureas, metformin as ﬁrst--
line therapy has beneﬁcial effects on
A1C, is weight neutral, does not cause
hypoglycemia, and reduces cardiovascu-
lar mortality (96). Metformin is also more
effective than dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DPP-4) inhibitors in lowering A1C and
weight when used as monotherapy (97).

The principal side effects of metfor-
min are gastrointestinal intolerance due
to bloating, abdominal discomfort, and
diarrhea; these can be mitigated by grad-
ual dose titration and/or using extended-
release formulation. The drug is cleared
by kidney ﬁltration, and metformin may
be safely used in people with estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate $30 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (98). Very high circulating levels
(e.g., as a result of overdose or acute kid-
ney injury) have been associated with lac-
tic acidosis (99). However, the occurrence
of this complication is very rare (100) and
primarily occurs when the estimated glo-
merular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) is <30 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (101). For people with an
eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m2, there is
an increased risk for periodic decreases

of eGFR to #30 mL/min/1.73 m2 which
heightens the risk of lactic acidosis. Met-
formin use is also associated with in-
creased risk of vitamin B12 deﬁciency and
worsening of symptoms of neuropathy
(102,103), suggesting periodic testing of
vitamin B12 levels (see Section 3,
“Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and
Associated Comorbidities”).

The comparative glucose-lowering efﬁ-
cacy of different pharmacologic agents
has been examined primarily in network
meta-analyses, as few prospective clinical
trials have compared multiple drug clas-
ses head-to-head. In general, the largest
reductions in A1C levels are achieved by
treatment plans that include insulin, se-
lect GLP-1 RAs (particularly semaglutide),
and tirzepatide, while DPP-4 inhibitors re-
sulted in the smallest reductions in A1C
(104–106). In A Diabetes Outcome Progres-
sion Trial (ADOPT), rosiglitazone monother-
apy was more effective than metformin
and glyburide monotherapies in achieving
and maintaining fasting plasma glucose
below 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) among
recently diagnosed individuals with type 2
diabetes whose baseline fasting plasma
glucose was 126–180 mg/dL (7–10 mmol/L),
while glyburide was least effective (107).
More recently, the Glycemia Reduction
Approaches in Type 2 Diabetes: A Com-
parative Effectiveness (GRADE) trial com-
pared use of insulin glargine U-100,
liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride as add-
on treatments to metformin monotherapy
among individuals with type 2 diabetes
and baseline A1C 6.8–8.5% (108). It found
that at 5 years, all therapies decreased
A1C levels but glargine and liraglutide
were modestly more effective in achiev-
ing and maintaining A1C below 7%, while
sitagliptin was least effective. Severe hy-
poglycemia was signiﬁcantly more com-
mon in those prescribed glargine or
glimepiride. An observational study that
emulated many of GRADE’s design fea-
tures and included canagliﬂozin as a com-
parator arm, but did not include insulin
glargine, found that liraglutide was more
effective at achieving and maintaining
A1C below 7% than sitagliptin, canagliﬂo-
zin, or glimepiride, which all had compa-
rable effectiveness (108).

Thus, when choosing a glucose-lowering
medication to achieve individualized gly-
cemic goals, we recommend engaging in
shared decision-making and considering
factors such as glucose-lowering efﬁcacy,
the side effect proﬁle, and medication

accessibility and affordability (108). In all
cases, treatment plans need to be contin-
uously reviewed for efﬁcacy, side effects,
hypoglycemia, and treatment burden
(Table 9.2).

When A1C is $1.5% above the individ-
ualized glycemic goal
(see Section 6,
“Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia,” for
appropriate goals), many individuals will
require dual-combination therapy or a
more potent glucose-lowering agent to
achieve and maintain their goal A1C level
(89)
Insulin
(Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2).
should be considered as part of any com-
bination medication plan when hypergly-
cemia is severe, especially if catabolic
features (weight loss, hypertriglyceride-
mia, and ketosis) are present. It is com-
mon practice to initiate insulin therapy
for people who present with blood glu-
cose levels $300 mg/dL ($16.7 mmol/L)
or A1C >10% (>86 mmol/mol) or if the
individual has symptoms of hyperglyce-
mia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia) or evi-
dence of catabolism (unexpected weight
loss) (Fig. 9.4). As glucose toxicity re-
solves, simplifying the medication plan
and/or changing to noninsulin agents is
possible. Additionally, there is evidence
that people with type 2 diabetes and se-
vere hyperglycemia can also be effectively
treated with a sulfonylurea, a GLP-1 RA,
or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, though evi-
dence is scarce for individuals with base-
line A1C above 10–12% (104,109–111).
GLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide have additional
beneﬁts over insulin and sulfonylureas,
speciﬁcally lower risks for hypoglycemia
(both) and favorable weight (both), car-
diovascular (GLP-1 RAs), kidney (GLP-1
RAs), and liver (both) end points.

Combination Therapy
Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive
disease, maintenance of glycemic goals
often requires combination therapy. Tra-
ditional recommendations have called for
the use of stepwise addition of medica-
tions to metformin to maintain A1C goals.
The advantage of this is to provide a clear
assessment of the positive and negative
effects of new drugs and reduce potential
side effects and expense (112). However,
some data support initial combination
therapy for more rapid attainment of glyce-
mic goals (113,114) and later combination
therapy for longer durability of glycemic
effect (115). Initial combination therapy
should be considered in people presenting

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Use principles in Figure 9.3, including reinforcement of behavioral interventions (weight management 
and physical activity) and provision of DSMES, to meet individualized treatment goals

If injectable therapy is needed to reduce A1C1

To avoid 
therapeutic 
inertia, reassess 
and modify 
treatment 
regularly 
(3-6 months)

Initiate appropriate starting dose for agent selected (varies within class)
Titrate to maintenance dose (varies within class)

2

If already on GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA, or if
these are not appropriate, or if insulin is preferred

If A1C is above goal 

Considerations for adding basal insulin3
Choice of basal insulin should be based on person-specific considerations, including cost. Refer to Table 9.4 for insulin 
cost information. Consider prescription of glucagon for emergent hypoglycemia.

Initiation and titration of basal analog or bedtime NPH insulin4

Start 10 units per day OR 0.1-0.2 units/kg per day

•    Set FPG goal (see Section 6, "Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia")
•  Choose evidence-based titration algorithm, e.g., increase 2 units every 3 days to reach FPG goal without 

hypoglycemia
For hypoglycemia: determine cause; if no clear reason, lower dose by 10-20%

Assess adequacy of insulin dose at every visit
Consider clinical signals to evaluate for overbasalization and need to consider adjunctive therapies (e.g., elevated bedtime-
to-morning and/or postprandial-to-preprandial differential, hypoglycemia [aware or unaware], high glucose variability)

(cid:129)    If A1C is above goal and the individual is not already on a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, consider these 

classes in combination and  with insulin (may use fixed-ratio product, if available and appropriate)3
If A1C remains above goal:

• 

Initiation and titration of prandial insulin5,6
Usually one dose with the largest meal or meal with greatest PPG excursion; 
prandial insulin can be dosed individually or mixed with NPH as appropriate

•  4 units per day or 10% of basal insulin dose
•    If A1C <8% (<64 mmol/mol), consider lowering the
      basal dose by 4 units per day or 10% of basal dose

•

•

Increase dose by 1-2 units insulin dose or 10-15%
twice weekly
For hypoglycemia: determine cause; if no clear
reason, lower corresponding dose by 10-20%

If on bedtime NPH, consider converting 
to twice-daily NPH plan
Conversion based on individual needs and current glycemic 
management. The following is one possible approach:

•    Total dose = 80% of current bedtime NPH dose
•  2/3 given in the morning
•  1/3 given at bedtime

•  Titrate based on individualized needs

If A1C  is above goal

Stepwise doses of prandial insulin 
(i.e., two, then three additional injections) 

Consider self-mixed/split insulin plan 
Can adjust NPH and short/rapid-
acting insulins separately 

Proceed to full basal-bolus plan 
(i.e., basal insulin and prandial insulin with 
each meal) 

• Total NPH dose = 80% of current NPH dose 

at the same total

•  2/3 given before breakfast
•  1/3 given before dinner 
•  Add 4 units of short/rapid-acting insulin to 
each injection or 10% of reduced NPH dose

•  Titrate each component of the plan based 

on individualized needs

Consider twice-daily premixed insulin plan

•  Usually unit per unit at the same total 

insulin dose, but may require adjustment to 
individual needs

•  Titrate based on individualized needs

1.  Consider insulin as the first injectable if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present, when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e., A1C >10% [>86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥300 mg/dL [≥16.7

mmol/L]), or when a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is a possibility.

2.   When selecting GLP-1 RAs, consider individual preference, A1C lowering, weight-lowering effect, and frequency of injection. If CVD is present, consider GLP-1 RA with proven CVD benefit; oral or injectable 

GLP-1 RAs are appropriate.

3.   For people on GLP-1 RA and basal Insulin combination, consider use of a fixed-ratio combination product (IDegLira or iGlarLixi). 

4.  Consider switching from evening NPH to a basal analog if the individual develops hypoglycemia and/or frequently forgets to administer NPH in the evening and would be better managed with a morning dose 

of a long-acting basal Insulin. Consider dosing NPH in the morning for steroid-induced hyperglycemia.

5.  Prandial insulin options include injectable rapid- and ultra-rapid-acting analog insulins, injectable short-acting human insulin, or inhaled human insulin.

6.  If adding prandial insulin to NPH, consider initiation of a self-mixed or premixed insulin plan to decrease the number of injections required.

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

S193

with A1C levels 1.5–2.0% above their indi-
vidualized goal. Finally,
incorporation
of high-glycemic-efﬁcacy therapies or
therapies for cardiovascular and kidney
disease risk reduction (e.g., GLP-1 RAs,
dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, and SGLT2 inhibi-
tors) may reduce the need for agents that
increase the risks of hypoglycemia and
weight gain or are less well tolerated.
Thus, treatment intensiﬁcation requires
purposeful selection of medications in
alignment with multiple individualized
person-centered treatment goals simul-
taneously (Fig. 9.3).

Treatment intensiﬁcation, deintensiﬁ-
cation, or modiﬁcation, as appropriate,
for people not meeting individualized
treatment goals should not be delayed
(therapeutic inertia) (116). Results from
comparative effectiveness meta-analyses
suggest that each new class of oral nonin-
sulin agents when added to metformin
generally lowers A1C by approximately
0.7–1.0% (8–11 mmol/mol). Addition of
GLP-1 RAs or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA
to metformin usually results in 1 to $2%
lowering of A1C (104,117,118) (Fig. 9.3
and Table 9.2). We do not recommend
using GLP-1 RAs (or the dual GIP and
GLP-1 RA) together with a DPP-4 inhibitor
as there is no added glucose-lowering
beneﬁt beyond that of the GLP-1 RA
alone (119–121).

When even greater potency of glucose
reduction is needed, basal insulin, either
human NPH or a long-acting insulin ana-
log, should be initiated. However, if the
individual is not already receiving GLP-1
RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA therapy,
an agent from these classes should be
started ﬁrst, as it may be sufﬁcient for
achieving individualized A1C goals but
with lower risk of hypoglycemia and with
favorable weight, cardiovascular, kidney,
and liver proﬁles. While most GLP-1 RAs
are injectable medications, an oral formu-
lation of semaglutide is commercially avail-
able (122). In trials analyzing the addition
of an injectable GLP-1 RA, dual GIP and
GLP-1 RA, or insulin in people needing fur-
ther glucose lowering, glycemic efﬁcacies
of GLP-1 RAs and the dual GIP and GLP-1
RA were similar to or greater than that of
insulin (123–130). GLP-1 RAs and
basal
dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in these trials also
had a lower risk of hypoglycemia and ben-
eﬁcial effects on body weight compared
with insulin, albeit with greater gastroin-
testinal side effects. Thus, trial results sup-
port high-potency GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP

and GLP-1 RA as the preferred options for
individuals requiring more intensive glu-
cose management (Fig. 9.4).

In individuals who are intensiﬁed to in-
sulin therapy, combination therapy with a
GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA has
been shown to have greater efﬁcacy and
durability of glycemic treatment effects,
as well as weight and hypoglycemia bene-
ﬁts, than treatment intensiﬁcation with
insulin alone (89,131). However, cost, ac-
cessibility, and tolerability are important
considerations for GLP-1 RA and dual GIP
and GLP-1 RA use.

In all cases, treatment plans need to
be continuously reviewed for efﬁcacy,
side effects (including hypoglycemia), and
treatment burden (Table 9.2). In some
instances, the individual will require
medication reduction or discontinuation.
Common reasons for this include ineffec-
tiveness, hypoglycemia, intolerable side
effects, new contraindications, expense,
or a change in glycemic goals (e.g., in re-
sponse to development of comorbid-
ities). See below for cost considerations
of glucose-lowering therapies (MEDICATION
COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY). Section 13, “Older
Adults,” has a full discussion of treatment
considerations in older adults. Treatment
deintensiﬁcation may also be needed in
the setting of weight loss and/or optimiza-
tion of lifestyle behaviors, when fewer
pharmacologic agents are needed to
maintain A1C goals. In this case, we rec-
ommend preferential deescalation of
therapies that are most likely to cause
side effects, hypoglycemia, and/or treat-
ment burden and do not have cardiovas-
cular, kidney, or metabolic beneﬁts for
continued use.

Glucose-Lowering Therapy for
People With Cardiovascular Disease
or Risk Factors for Cardiovascular
Disease
For people with type 2 diabetes and es-
tablished ASCVD or indicators of high
ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibi-
tor and/or GLP-1 RA with demonstrated
cardiovascular beneﬁt (Table 9.2) is recom-
mended independent of A1C, with or with-
out metformin use, and in consideration of
person-speciﬁc factors (Fig. 9.3). Individuals
with these comorbidities already achieving
their individualized glycemic goals with
other medications may beneﬁt
from
switching to these preferred medications
to reduce risk of ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD
in addition to achieving glycemic goals

(see Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease
and Risk Management,” and Section 11,
“Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Man-
agement”). This is particularly important
because SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs
are associated with lower risk of hypo-
glycemia and individuals with ASCVD,
HF, and CKD have higher hypoglycemia
risk than individuals without these condi-
tions (132).

Individuals at lower risk for ASCVD
may still beneﬁt from GLP-1 RA therapy
to reduce their risk of future cardiovas-
cular events. The GRADE trial, which was
designed to examine the comparative ef-
fectiveness of insulin glargine U-100, gli-
mepiride,
liraglutide, and sitagliptin in
individuals with relatively short duration
of diabetes (and, due to study eligibility
criteria, low ASCVD risk) with respect to
achieving and maintaining A1C below 7%,
found that individuals treated with liraglu-
tide had a slightly lower risk of cardiovas-
cular disease than individuals receiving
the other three treatments (hazard ratio
0.7 [95% CI 0.6–0.9]), although no signiﬁ-
cant differences were found for major ad-
verse cardiovascular events, hospitalization
for HF, or cardiovascular death (133). Indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes and moderate
levels of CVD risk appear to derive cardio-
vascular and mortality beneﬁts with prefer-
ential use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2
inhibitors compared with sulfonylurea or
DPP-4 inhibitors (134). Similarly, while
greater reductions in HF hospitalization
risk are observed with SGLT2 inhibitor
therapy in individuals with higher base-
line HF risk, some beneﬁt is observed
across the full range of HF risk (135).

Glucose-Lowering Therapy for
People With Chronic Kidney Disease
individuals with type 2 diabetes
For
and CKD, considerations for selection
of glucose-lowering medications include
their effectiveness and safety when eGFR
is reduced as well as the potential to im-
pact CKD progression, CVD risk, and hypo-
glycemia (136). Preferred medications for
glucose management in individuals with
CKD are GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors
(can be initiated if eGFR is above 20 mL/
min/1.73 m2). GLP-1 RAs are effective in
lowering glucose levels, regardless of kid-
ney function, with a low risk for hypogly-
cemia, and a recent clinical trial suggests
that the GLP-1 RA semaglutide has a ben-
eﬁcial effect on CVD, mortality, and kid-
ney outcomes among people with CKD,

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

leading to the recommendation that sem-
aglutide can be used as another ﬁrst-line
agent for people with CKD (137,138).
Other GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide and dulaglu-
tide) may also have CKD beneﬁts, but no
other dedicated kidney trials have been
published. Similarly, no dedicated kidney
outcomes studies for the dual GIP and
GLP-1 RA (tirzepatide) have been pub-
lished. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials
in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes
have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors em-
pagliﬂozin, canagliﬂozin, and dapagliﬂozin
have beneﬁcial effects on slowing progres-
sion of CKD and CV outcomes in this popu-
lation (139–141). However, their ability to
lower glucose levels declines when the
eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2
(142–144). Metformin is also a preferred
agent for those with CKD due to its well-
documented efﬁcacy and safety proﬁle
for all people with type 2 diabetes. How-
ever, there is no documented direct
kidney beneﬁt. Importantly, metformin
should not be started in those whose
eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. For those
the
already treated with metformin,
dose of metformin should be reduced
once eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and
should be stopped once eGFR is <30 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (98). A secondary analysis of
the GRADE trial found that insulin glar-
gine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride
did not prevent the development of CKD
when added to metformin monotherapy
in individuals without underlying CKD
(145).
Importantly, an SGLT2 inhibitor
was not included in the GRADE trial.

Individuals with CKD, particularly ad-
vanced CKD and kidney failure, are
at high risk for hypoglycemia (132). If
treated with insulin and/or sulfonylur-
eas, treatment needs to be closely moni-
tored and adjusted as eGFR declines and
individuals need to be educated about
and closely monitored for hypoglycemia
occurrence (136). See Section 11, “Chronic
Kidney Disease and Risk Management,”
for more details about prevention and
treatment of CKD in individuals with
diabetes.

Glucose-Lowering Therapy for
People With Metabolic Comorbidities
Many adults with diabetes, either type 2
diabetes or type 1 diabetes, with obesity
are at high risk of developing MASLD or
MASH as well as MASH cirrhosis. Hence,
the presence of MASLD or MASH should
be a consideration when choosing glucose-

lowering therapies. Accruing randomized
clinical trial data suggest that pioglitazone,
GLP-1 RA, and a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA
have potential beneﬁts in terms of decreas-
ing hepatic steatosis and in the resolution
of MASH without worsening of ﬁbrosis in
individuals with biopsy-proven MASH or
those at higher risk of clinically signiﬁcant
liver ﬁbrosis identiﬁed with noninvasive
tests (146–153). Combination therapy with
pioglitazone plus GLP-1 RA should also be
considered for treatment of hyperglycemia
in adults with type 2 diabetes with biopsy-
proven MASH or those at higher risk of
clinically signiﬁcant liver ﬁbrosis identiﬁed
with noninvasive tests, as such therapy is
safe and effective and has been shown to
reduce hepatic steatosis (154–156). It is im-
portant to note that these studies are
based on phase 2 clinical trials and await
further phase 3 conﬁrmation of evidence.
However, these plans are preferred as they
offer potential beneﬁt compared with lack
of histological beneﬁt (or clinical trial data)
from other glucose-lowering therapies in
MASLD. Further details regarding liver
health in diabetes can be found in Section 4,
“Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and
Assessment of Comorbidities.”

Obesity is present in over 90% of peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes, and in these in-
dividuals weight management is a key
treatment goal, along with glucose lower-
ing. In the setting of obesity, the choice of
glucose-lowering medications should take
into consideration their effects on weight.
Insulins, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidine-
diones can promote weight gain and
should be used judiciously and at the low-
est possible dose. Glucose-lowering medi-
cations that promote weight loss should
be prioritized. Of the currently available
agents, tirzepatide and semaglutide have
the highest efﬁcacy in terms of glucose
lowering as well as weight loss, followed
by dulaglutide, liraglutide, and extended-
release exenatide (157–161). Other glucose-
lowering medications (metformin, SGLT2
inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, dopamine
agonists, bile acid sequestrants, and a-
glucosidase inhibitors) are weight neu-
tral or have a modest beneﬁcial effect
on weight. These medications can be
used as add-on therapies in people with
type 2 diabetes and obesity who require
additional glucose lowering or if the more
effective medications are not tolerated,
are contraindicated, or are unavailable.
Metabolic surgery, especially Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy,

are very effective interventions to achieve
both weight and glycemic goals and have
additional health beneﬁts beyond im-
proving metabolism (162). Further details
regarding treatment of obesity can be

Management

for
Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes”).

Insulin Therapy
Many adults with type 2 diabetes eventu-
ally require and beneﬁt from insulin ther-
apy (Fig. 9.4). See INSULIN ADMINISTRATION
TECHNIQUE, above, for guidance on how to
administer insulin safely and effectively.
The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes
should be regularly and objectively ex-
plained to individuals with diabetes, and
clinicians should avoid using insulin as a
threat or describing it as a sign of per-
sonal failure. The utility and importance
of insulin to achieve and maintain glyce-
mic goals once progression of the disease
overcomes the effect of other agents as
well as for temporary use for acute situa-
tions (such as hospitalization, acute ill-
ness, or high-dose glucocorticoid therapy)
should be emphasized. Educating and in-
volving people with diabetes in insulin
management is beneﬁcial. For example,
instruction of individuals with type 2 dia-
betes initiating insulin on self-titration of
insulin doses based on glucose monitoring
improves glycemic management (163).
Comprehensive education regarding glucose
monitoring, nutrition, physical activity,
contingency planning (for illness, fasting,
or medication unavailability), and the pre-
vention and appropriate treatment of hy-
poglycemia are critically important for all
individuals using insulin. Assessment and
education tailored to improve health liter-
acy and numeracy may be necessary for
individuals to effectively use various insu-
lin dosing strategies and tools (64,65). See
Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Be-
haviors and Well-being to Improve Health
Outcomes,” for guidance on diabetes self-
management education.

Basal Insulin
Basal insulin alone is the most convenient
initial insulin treatment and can be added
to noninsulin glucose-lowering medica-
tions. For individuals with type 2 diabetes,
starting doses can be estimated based on
body weight (0.1–0.2 units/kg/day) and
the degree of hyperglycemia, with indi-
vidualized titration over days to weeks as

needed to achieve and maintain glycemic
goals. The principal action of basal insulin
is to restrain hepatic glucose production
and limit hyperglycemia overnight and
between meals (164,165). Attainment of
fasting glucose goals can be achieved
with human NPH insulin or a long-acting
insulin analog. In clinical trials, long-acting
basal analogs (U-100 glargine and dete-
mir) have been demonstrated to reduce
the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and noc-
turnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH
insulin (166). Longer-acting basal analogs
(U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a
lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than
U-100 glargine (167,168). It is important
to understand how to convert individuals
insulin to another, as
from one basal
switching insulins may be required due to
the availability of more clinically appropriate
insulin alternatives, removal of a product
from the market (i.e., insulin detemir), or
changes to insurance coverage. Often
doses can be converted unit for unit and
subsequently adjusted based on glucose
monitoring; however, an initial dose re-
duction of 10–20% can be used for indi-
viduals in very tight management or at
high risk for hypoglycemia and is typically
needed when switching from insulin de-
temir or U-300 glargine to another insulin
(169). Clinicians should also be aware of
the potential for overbasalization with in-
sulin therapy (i.e., use of higher than clini-
cally necessary and appropriate dose of
basal insulin, typically masking insufﬁcient
mealtime insulin). Clinical signals that
should prompt evaluation for overbasali-
zation include high bedtime-to-morning
or preprandial-to-postprandial glucose
differential (e.g., bedtime-to-morning glucose
differential $50 mg/dL [$2.8 mmol/L]),
hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and
high glucose variability. Evidence of over-
basalization should prompt reevaluation
of the glucose-lowering treatment plan to
better address postprandial hyperglyce-
mia (170).

Combination Injectable Therapy and Pran-
dial Insulin
If basal insulin has been titrated to an ac-
ceptable fasting blood glucose level and
A1C remains above goal, if there is evi-
dence of signiﬁcant postprandial hyper-
glycemia, or if signs of overbasalization
are present, advancement to combination
injectable therapy is necessary (Fig. 9.4).
This approach can use a GLP-1 RA or dual
GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or

multiple doses of prandial insulin (131,171).
If an individual is not already being treated
with a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA,
a GLP-1 RA (either as an individual product
or in a ﬁxed-ratio combination with a basal
insulin product) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA
should be considered prior to starting
prandial insulin to address prandial man-
agement and to lower the risks of hypo-
glycemia and weight gain associated
with insulin therapy (131,172).

Further intensiﬁcation of insulin ther-
apy entails adding doses of prandial insu-
lin to basal insulin. Starting with a single
prandial dose with the largest meal of the
day is simple and effective, and it can be
advanced to a plan with multiple prandial
doses if necessary (173). We suggest start-
ing with a prandial insulin dose of 4 units
or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at
the largest meal or the meal with the
greatest postprandial excursion. The pran-
dial insulin plan can then be intensiﬁed
based on individual needs (Fig. 9.4). Alter-
natively, for an individual treated with
basal insulin in whom additional prandial
coverage is desired but administering in-
sulin prior to one or more meals is not
feasible, the medication plan can be con-
verted to two doses of a premixed insulin.
Each approach has advantages and dis-
advantages. For example, basal-prandial
plans offer greater ﬂexibility for individu-
als who eat on irregular schedules, have
variable meal content, or otherwise beneﬁt
from greater individualization and ﬂexibility
in insulin administration. On the other
hand, two doses of premixed insulin is a
simple, convenient means of spreading
insulin across the day. Moreover, human
insulins, separately, self-mixed, or as pre-
mixed NPH/regular (for example, 70/30)
formulations, are often less costly alterna-
tives to insulin analogs.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes are
generally more insulin resistant than those
with type 1 diabetes, require higher daily
doses ((cid:1)1 unit/kg), and have lower rates
of hypoglycemia (174). Meta-analyses of
trials comparing rapid-acting insulin ana-
logs with human regular insulin in type 2
diabetes have not reported meaningful
differences in A1C or hypoglycemia
(175,176). Titration of prandial insulin can
be based on home self-monitored blood
glucose or CGM. When signiﬁcant addi-
insulin dose are
tions to the prandial
made, particularly with the evening meal,
consideration should be given to decreas-
insulin to reduce risk of
ing basal

hypoglycemia. When initiating intensiﬁca-
tion of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2
inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs (or a dual GIP
and GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, un-
less adverse effects (including signiﬁcant
treatment burden) or contraindications
are present. Use of sulfonylureas, megliti-
nides, and DPP-4 inhibitors should be lim-
ited or discontinued, as these medications
do not have additional beneﬁcial effects on
cardiovascular, kidney, weight, or liver out-
comes and (for sulfonylureas and megliti-
nides) increase risk of hypoglycemia and
weight gain. Adjunctive use of pioglita-
zone may help to improve glycemia and
reduce the amount of insulin needed, al-
though potential side effects should be
considered.

Once a basal-bolus insulin plan is initi-
ated, dose titration is important, with ad-
justments made in both prandial and basal
insulins based on blood glucose levels and
an understanding of the pharmacody-
namic proﬁle of each formulation (also
known as pattern control or pattern man-
agement). In some people with type 2 dia-
betes with signiﬁcant clinical complexity,
multimorbidity, and/or treatment burden,
it may become necessary to simplify or de-
intensify complex insulin plans to decrease
risk of hypoglycemia and improve quality
of life (see Section 13, “Older Adults”).

Concentrated Insulins
Concentrated preparations may be more
convenient (fewer injections to achieve
goal dose) and comfortable (less volume
to inject the desired dose and/or less in-
jection effort) for individuals and may im-
in
prove treatment plan engagement
those with insulin resistance who require
large doses of insulin. Several concen-
trated insulin preparations are currently
available. U-500 regular insulin is, by deﬁ-
nition, ﬁve times more concentrated than
U-100 regular insulin. U-500 regular insulin
has distinct pharmacokinetics with similar
onset but a delayed, blunted, and pro-
longed peak effect and longer duration of
action compared with U-100 regular insu-
lin; thus, it has characteristics more like a
premixed intermediate-acting (NPH) and
regular insulin product and can be used
as two or three daily injections (177,178).
U-300 glargine and U-200 degludec are
three and two times, respectively, as con-
centrated as their U-100 formulations
and allow higher doses of basal insulin
administration per volume used. U-300
glargine has a longer duration of action

than U-100 glargine but modestly lower
efﬁcacy per unit administered (179–181).
The U-200 formulations of insulin deglu-
dec, insulin lispro, and insulin lispro-aabc
have pharmacokinetics similar to those
of their U-100 counterparts (182–184).
While U-500 regular insulin is available in
both preﬁlled pens and vials, other con-
centrated insulins are available only in
preﬁlled pens to minimize the risk of dos-
ing errors. If U-500 regular insulin vials are
prescribed, the prescription should be ac-
companied by a prescription for U-500 sy-
ringes to minimize the risk of dosing errors.

Alternative Insulin Routes
Insulin is primarily administered via sub-
cutaneous injection or infusion. Adminis-
tration devices provide some additional
variation in the subcutaneous delivery be-
yond vial and syringe versus insulin pen.
Those devices include continuous insulin
pumps (programmable or automated basal
and bolus settings and ﬁxed basal and
bolus settings) and bolus-only insulin
patch pump. In addition, prandial or cor-
rection insulin doses may be administered
using inhaled human insulin. Inhaled insu-
lin is available as monomers of regular hu-
man insulin; studies in individuals with
type 1 diabetes suggest that inhaled insu-
lin has pharmacokinetics similar to those
of RAA (185). Studies comparing inhaled
insulin with injectable insulin have dem-
onstrated its faster onset and shorter
duration compared with the RAA insulin
lispro as well as clinically meaningful A1C
reductions and weight reductions com-
pared with the RAA insulin aspart over
24 weeks (186–188). Use of inhaled insu-
lin may result in a decline in lung function
(reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s
[FEV1]). Inhaled insulin is contraindicated
in individuals with chronic lung disease,
such as asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and is not recom-
mended in individuals who smoke or who
recently stopped smoking. All individuals
require spirometry (FEV1) testing to iden-
tify potential lung disease prior to and af-
ter starting inhaled insulin therapy.

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WITH
DIABETES

Recommendations
9.27 Monitor for signs of overbasal-
ization during insulin therapy, such

as signiﬁcant bedtime-to-morning or
postprandial-to-preprandial glucose
differential, occurrences of hypogly-
cemia (aware or unaware), and high
glycemic variability. When overbasal-
ization is suspected, a thorough re-
evaluation should occur promptly to
further tailor therapy to the individual’s
needs. E
9.28 Glucagon should be prescribed
for all individuals requiring intensive
insulin therapy or at high risk for hy-
poglycemia. Family, caregivers, school
personnel, and others providing sup-
port to these individuals should know
its location and be educated on how
to administer it. Glucagon prepara-
tions that do not require reconstitu-
tion are preferred. B
9.29 Routinely assess all people with
diabetes for ﬁnancial obstacles that
could impede their diabetes manage-
ment. Clinicians, members of the dia-
betes care team, and social services
professionals should work collabora-
tively, as appropriate and feasible, to
support these individuals by imple-
menting strategies to reduce costs,
thereby improving their access to
evidence-based care. E
9.30 In adults with diabetes and
cost-related barriers, consider use of
lower-cost medications for glycemic
management (i.e., metformin, sulfony-
lureas, thiazolidinediones, and human
insulin) within the context of their
risks for hypoglycemia, weight gain,
cardiovascular and kidney events, and
other adverse effects. E

Several key aspects of insulin manage-
ment that are relevant to all people
with diabetes requiring insulin therapy,
including available formulations, insulin
plans and delivery systems, administration
technique, and overbasalization, were dis-
cussed earlier in this section. Additional
considerations for glucose-lowering ther-
apy that may be relevant to people with
all types of diabetes include glucagon co-
prescription and affordability of diabetes
therapies.

Glucagon
Due to the risk of hypoglycemia with in-
individuals treated
sulin treatment, all
with insulin or who are at high risk for
hypoglycemia should be prescribed glu-
cagon. Individuals with diabetes who are

prescribed glucagon and those in close
contact with them should be educated
on the use and administration of the in-
dividual’s prescribed glucagon product.
The glucagon product available to indi-
viduals may differ based on coverage
and cost; however, products that do not
require reconstitution are preferred for
ease of administration (189,190). Clini-
cians should routinely review the individ-
ual’s access to glucagon, as appropriate
glucagon prescribing is low (191–193).
See Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hy-
poglycemia,” for additional
information
on hypoglycemia and glucagon in individ-
uals with diabetes.

Medication Costs and Affordability
Costs for noninsulin and insulin diabetes
medications have increased dramatically
over the past two decades, and an in-
creasing proportion of cost is now passed
on to people with diabetes and their fam-
ilies (194). Table 9.3 provides cost infor-
mation for currently approved noninsulin
therapies, while Table 9.4 provides these
data for insulin. Of note, prices listed are
average wholesale prices (AWP) (195)
and National Average Drug Acquisition
Costs (NADAC) (196); these estimates al-
low for a comparison of drug prices but
do not represent the actual costs to peo-
ple with diabetes because they do not ac-
count for various discounts, rebates, and
other price adjustments often involved in
prescription sales that affect the actual
cost incurred by the individual. Medica-
tion costs can be a major source of stress
for people with diabetes and contribute
to worse medication-taking behavior (197);
cost-reducing strategies may improve
medication-taking behavior in some cases
(198).

Although caps on out-of-pocket costs
for insulin have been implemented for
individuals with Medicare and for indi-
viduals on some commercial health
plans, and three major insulin manufac-
turers have capped costs at $35 per
month per insulin (199–202) (see Sec-
tion 1, “Improving Care and Promoting
Health in Populations”), individuals with
high-deductible health plans and those
without insurance coverage can incur very
high out-of-pocket expenses for glucose-
lowering therapies. Moreover, no such caps
exist for diabetes durable medical equip-
ment (i.e., equipment for glucose monitor-
for
ing and insulin administration) or

noninsulin medications. It is therefore es-
sential to screen all people with diabetes
for ﬁnancial concerns and cost-related
barriers to care and to engage members
of the health care team, including pharma-
cists, certiﬁed diabetes care and education
specialists, social workers, community
health workers, community paramedics,
and others, to identify cost-saving op-
portunities for medications, diabetes
durable medical equipment, and gluca-
gon (203).

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND
POPULATIONS

Recommendations
9.31a Use of compounded products
that are not approved by the FDA is
not recommended due to uncertainty
about their content and resulting con-
cerns about safety, quality, and effec-
tiveness. E
9.31b If a glucose-lowering medica-
tion is unavailable (e.g.,
in short-
age), it is recommended to switch
to a different FDA-approved medi-
cation with similar efﬁcacy, as clini-
cally appropriate. E
9.31c Upon resolution of the unavail-
ability (e.g., shortage), reassess the
appropriateness of resuming the orig-
inal FDA-approved medication. E
9.32a Individuals with diabetes of
childbearing potential should be coun-
seled on contraception options A and
the impact of some glucose-lowering
medications on contraception efﬁcacy. C
9.32b A person-centered shared
decision-making approach to precon-
ception planning is essential for all
individuals with diabetes and of child-
bearing potential. A Preconception
planning should address attainment
of glycemic goals, A the time frame
for discontinuing noninsulin glucose-
lowering medications, E and optimal
glycemic management in preparation
for pregnancy. A
9.33 Educate individuals with diabetes
who are at risk for developing diabetic
ketoacidosis and/or follow a ketogenic
eating pattern and who are treated
with SGLT inhibitors on the risks and
signs of ketoacidosis and methods
of risk mitigation management, and
provide them with appropriate tools
for accurate ketone measurement (i.e.,
serum b-hydroxybutyrate). E

Therapeutic Strategies With
Medication Unavailability
Health care professionals and people with
diabetes struggle when medication sup-
plies are insufﬁcient to meet the demand.
Recent examples of such circumstances
include recalls involving a number of met-
formin products and the marked increase
in demand for agents from the GLP-1 RA
and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA classes. The
latter circumstance led to such a low level
of availability that products were deter-
mined by the FDA to be in shortage (204).
To assist with supply of medications dur-
ing the time they are in shortage (as sig-
naled by their inclusion on the FDA Drug
Shortages Database), compounding phar-
macies and outsourcing compounding fa-
cilities are allowed to make copies, or
products that are essentially duplicates
of the marketed FDA-approved product
(205). A signiﬁcant number of concerning
reports regarding safety and efﬁcacy of
compounded incretin products have
emerged, however,
including using salt
forms of the FDA-approved product’s ac-
tive ingredient that are not proven safe or
effective for use in humans, incorporation
of additional
ingredients not clinically
tested when mixed with incretin products
(e.g., vitamin B12 and vitamin B6), products
provided in nonstandard concentrations
and doses and/or multidose vials and pre-
ﬁlled syringes not accompanied by educa-
tion or labeling to mitigate administration
errors, and the emergence of counterfeit
products that pose signiﬁcant risk to indi-
viduals taking these products (206–209).
Due to safety, quality, and effectiveness
concerns, use of non–FDA-approved com-
pounded products is not recommended
(210).
Instead, consider switching to a
different FDA-approved medication as
clinically appropriate (211). Once the
desired FDA-approved product becomes
available,
individuals should be reas-
sessed to determine the appropriate-
ness of resuming the product based on
their current care needs, preferences,
and priorities.

Care Considerations for Individuals
of Childbearing Potential
The impact of glycemia during pregnancy
is well understood; however, evidence for
the safe use of noninsulin glucose-lower-
ing medications is limited (see Section 15,
“Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy”).
Studies on the efﬁcacy and safety of
glucose-lowering medications exclude

individuals who are pregnant and require
individuals of childbearing potential to use
one or two forms of contraception. It is
recommended that individuals of child-
bearing potential use a form of contracep-
tion when also taking glucose-lowering
medications with unknown risks, limited
evidence on safety, or known risks during
pregnancy, regardless of the individual’s in-
tention to become pregnant, as many
pregnancies are unplanned. The options
for contraception should be discussed
with all individuals of childbearing poten-
tial with diabetes and should include in-
formation regarding the potential impact
of glucose-lowering medications on the
effectiveness of contraception. Medica-
tions that impact gastrointestinal empty-
ing time (e.g., GLP-1 RAs or dual GIP and
GLP-1 RA) may affect the absorption of
orally administered medications, includ-
ing oral contraception. The impact on
gastric emptying with GLP-1 RAs and the
dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is highest at initia-
tion and with dosage increases and then
diminishes with continued administration
(212). Tirzepatide, the dual GIP and GLP-1
RA, was shown to impact the levels of
oral contraception during the time of its
highest impact on gastric emptying; the
GLP-1 RAs may impact the levels of oral
contraception as well but to a lesser ex-
tent than tirzepatide (213,214). Thus, in-
dividuals starting or increasing doses of
tirzepatide who also take oral contracep-
tion should use a second form of contra-
ception until the maintenance dose of
tirzepatide is achieved and used for at
least 4 weeks (215).

Preconception counseling should be
part of the routine care of individuals with
diabetes who have childbearing potential.
Counseling should include the known ben-
eﬁts and risks of glucose-lowering medica-
tions as well as other medications (e.g.,
lipid-lowering and antihypertensive thera-
pies) during pregnancy and recommenda-
tions for when changes in medications
should occur prior to pregnancy (see Sec-
tion 15, “Management of Diabetes in
Pregnancy,” for more information on pre-
conception counseling and glucose-lowering
treatment during pregnancy).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors
diabetes.
(ICIs) (agents that block programmed cell
death protein 1 [PD-1] and programmed
cell death protein ligand 1 [PD-L1]) suppress
physiologic blocks on immune responses,
which can result in autoimmune toxicities,
including autoimmune diabetes (incidence
approximately #1%). ICI-diabetes is an in-
sulin-deﬁcient phenotype that presents as
acute severe hyperglycemia or DKA and
appears to occur more abruptly than
type 1 diabetes (216–218).

Alpelisib, a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitor, frequently results in hy-
perglycemia by inhibiting PI3Ka, which
systemically blocks the intracellular action
of insulin, resulting in a transient state
of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia
(219). Hyperglycemia occurs early during
therapy (median time of onset of about
2 weeks from initiation of alpelisib) with
an incidence of (cid:1)60% overall and typi-
cally resolves upon treatment cessation
(220–222). Metformin is the ﬁrst-line oral

agent to treat alpelsib-induced hyperglyce-
mia, and prophylactic initiation of metfor-
min has been recommended for people
with prediabetes receiving alpelsib (223).
SGLT2 inhibitors and pioglitazone are ap-
propriate second- or third-line agents, de-
pending on side effect and clinical proﬁles,
and may be used in combination with or
without metformin. Insulin and sulfonylur-
eas should be considered last-line agents,
as insulin can reactivate the PI3K pathway,
negating the effects of alpelisib (223,224).

quisition Cost. AWP (195) and NADAC (196) prices as of 1 July 2024. *AWP or NADAC calculated as in Table 9.3. †Unbranded product prices

mTOR kinase inhibitors, including everi-
lomus, cause hyperglycemia by interfering
with insulin signaling, leading to impaired
insulin secretion and increased insulin
resistance. Metformin is the ﬁrst-line

treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to
mTOR inhibitor treatment, with insulin
and other noninsulin treatments added in
a stepwise fashion dependent on glucose
level (225).

Therapeutic Strategies for Individuals
With Other Types of Diabetes
Individuals with pancreatogenic diabetes
may require early insulin initiation to
achieve and maintain glycemic goals. In

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
S200

Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

individuals with a history of pancreatitis,
use of incretin medications (i.e., GLP-1
RAs, GIP and GLP-1 RA, and DPP-4 inhibi-
tors) should be avoided (see Section 2,
“Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes”).
Individuals with cystic ﬁbrosis–related di-
abetes should be treated with insulin
therapy; insulin pump therapy, including
automated insulin delivery systems, should
be considered when appropriate (226).

There are limited data to inform the op-
timal pharmacologic management of post-
transplant diabetes (227) (see Section 2,
“Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes”).
While immediately posttransplant many in-
dividuals require insulin therapy, noninsulin
therapies can be used for long-term man-
agement. Studies of metformin, DPP-4 in-
hibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and
pioglitazone in individuals who have un-
dergone kidney, heart, or liver transplan-
tation have demonstrated effectiveness
and safety but are limited by small sam-
ple sizes, short follow-up, and risk of bias
due to retrospective or single-arm pro-
spective designs (228). Metformin should
be used with caution; it should not be ini-
tiated if eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, it
should be stopped with eGFR $30 mL/
min/1.73 m2, and it should not be used in
instability due to
the setting of clinical
concerns for acute kidney injury and lactic
acidosis. Metformin use may be associ-
ated with lower risks of cardiac allograph
vasculopathy after heart transplantation
(229) and all-cause, malignancy-related,
and infection-related mortality after kid-
ney transplantation (230). GLP-1 RA ther-
apy may be preferred for many individuals
due to the demonstrated beneﬁt of GLP-1
RAs on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and
liver outcomes. Studies have not found ev-
idence of drug interaction with immuno-
suppression, including ﬁnding no changes
in dosing or toxicity (231–233). SGLT2
inhibitors may be similarly preferred for
individuals with ASCVD, HF, and CKD and
appear to be safe and effective in post-
transplantation diabetes. However, there
is increased risk of genitourinary tract infec-
tion, which is a concern in individuals receiv-
ing immunosuppression and in those who
have undergone kidney transplantation.

Individuals with maturity-onset diabe-
tes of the young due to HNF1A and
HNF4A mutations can be treated with
low-dose sulfonylurea therapy but may
ultimately require insulin therapy (234)
(see Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation
of Diabetes”) (Table 2.7). For those with

HNF1A mutations, addition of a DPP-4
inhibitor to the sulfonylurea may help
improve glycemic variability and attain-
ment of glycemic goals (235). Individu-
als with neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ22
and ABCC8 mutations can be treated with
high-dose sulfonylureas, while those with
INS, GATA6, EIF2AK3, and FOXP3 muta-
tions require insulin therapy (234).

SGLT Inhibition and Risk of Ketosis
Individuals with type 1 diabetes (84,236)
and insulin-deﬁcient type 2 diabetes are at
increased risk for DKA with SGLT inhibitor
therapy. SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA
occurs in approximately 4% of people
with type 1 diabetes; the risk can be 5–17
times higher than that in people with T1D
not treated with SGLT inhibitors (237). It
is important to note that SGLT2 inhibitors
are not approved for use in people with
type 1 diabetes. In contrast, DKA is un-
common in people with type 2 diabetes
treated with SGLT inhibitors, with an esti-
mated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per
1,000 person-years (238). Risk factors for
DKA in individuals with either type 1 or
type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT inhibi-
tors include very-low-carbohydrate diets,
prolonged fasting, dehydration, excessive
alcohol intake, and other common precip-
itating factors (84,236). Up to a third of
people treated with SGLT2 inhibitors who
developed DKA present with glucose levels
<200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) (239), and in
one study 71% presented with glucose lev-
els #250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) (240);
therefore, it is important to educate at-
risk individuals about the signs and symp-
toms of DKA and DKA mitigation and
management and to prescribe accurate
tools for ketone measurement. Individuals
who have experienced DKA should not be
treated with SGLT inhibition. Additional
guidance on DKA risk mitigation is avail-
able in Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and
Hypoglycemia.”
