The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” in-
cludes the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to
provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guide-
lines, and tools to evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional
Practice Committee, an interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for
updating the Standards of Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a
detailed description of ADA standards, statements, and reports, as well as the
evidence-grading system for ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full
list of Professional Practice Committee members, please refer to Introduction
and Methodology. Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are
invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

For prevention and management of diabetes complications in children and adoles-
cents, please refer to Section 14, “Children and Adolescents.”

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Screening

Recommendations
11.1a Assess kidney function (i.e., spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR])
and estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] in people with type 1 diabetes
with duration of $5 years and in all people with type 2 diabetes regardless of
treatment. B
11.1b In people with established chronic kidney disease (CKD), monitor uri-
nary albumin (e.g., spot UACR) and eGFR 1–4 times per year depending on
the stage of the kidney disease (Fig. 11.1). B

Treatment

Recommendations
11.2 Optimize glucose management to reduce the risk or slow the progression
of CKD (Fig. 9.3). A
11.3 Optimize blood pressure management (aim for <130/80 mmHg [Fig.
10.2]) and reduce blood pressure variability to reduce the risk or slow the
progression of CKD and reduce cardiovascular risk. A
11.4a In nonpregnant people with diabetes and hypertension, either an ACE in-
hibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for those with
moderately increased albuminuria (UACR 30–299 mg/g creatinine) B and is
strongly recommended for those with severely increased albuminuria (UACR

Figure 11.1—Risk of CKD progression, cardiovascular disease risk, and mortality; frequency of visits; and referral to nephrology according to GFR
and albuminuria. The numbers in the boxes are a guide to the frequency of screening or monitoring (number of times per year). Green reﬂects no
evidence of CKD by estimated GFR or albuminuria, with screening indicated once per year. For monitoring of prevalent CKD, suggested monitoring
varies from once per year (yellow) to four times or more per year (i.e., every 1–3 months [deep red]) according to risks of CKD progression and
CKD complications (e.g., cardiovascular disease, anemia, and hyperparathyroidism). These are general parameters based only on expert opinion
and underlying comorbid conditions, and disease state must be taken into account, as should the likelihood of impacting a change in management
for any individual. CKD, chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular ﬁltration rate. Adapted from de Boer et al. (1).

issues, and rapidly progressing kidney
disease. B

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES AND
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diag-
nosed by the persistent elevation of uri-
nary albumin excretion (albuminuria),
low estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR), or other manifestations of kid-
ney damage (1). In this section, the fo-
cus is on CKD attributed to diabetes in
adults, which occurs in 20–40% of peo-
ple with diabetes (1–4). CKD in people
with diabetes typically develops after a
duration of 10 years in type 1 diabetes
(the most common presentation is 5–15
years after the diagnosis of type 1 dia-
betes) but may be present at diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes. CKD can progress to
kidney failure requiring dialysis or kid-
ney transplantation and is the leading
cause of end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD) in the U.S. (5). In addition,
among people with type 1 or type 2 di-
abetes, the presence of CKD markedly
increases cardiovascular risk and health
care costs (6). For details on the man-
agement of CKD in children with diabe-
tes, please see Section 14, “Children
and Adolescents.”

ASSESSMENT OF ALBUMINURIA
AND ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR
FILTRATION RATE
Screening for albuminuria can be most
easily performed by urine albumin-to-
creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot
urine collection (1). Timed or 24-h collec-
tions are more burdensome and add little
to prediction or accuracy. Measurement
of a spot urine sample for albumin alone
(whether by immunoassay or by using a
sensitive dipstick test speciﬁc for albu-
minuria) without simultaneously mea-
suring urine creatinine is less expensive
but susceptible to false-negative and false-
positive determinations as a result of vari-
ation in urine concentration due to hydra-
tion (7). Thus, semiquantitative or
qualitative (dipstick) screening will need to
be conﬁrmed by UACR values in an accred-
ited laboratory (8,9). Hence, it is better to
simply collect a spot urine sample for

albumin-to-creatinine ratio because it will
ultimately need to be done.

Normal level of urine albumin excre-
tion is deﬁned as <30 mg/g creatinine,
moderately elevated albuminuria is de-
ﬁned as $30–300 mg/g creatinine, and
severely elevated albuminuria is deﬁned as
$300 mg/g creatinine. However, UACR is a
continuous measurement, and differences
within the normal and abnormal ranges are
associated with kidney and cardiovascular
outcomes (6,10,11). Furthermore, because
of high biological variability of >20% be-
tween measurements in urinary albumin ex-
cretion, two of three specimens of UACR
collected within a 3-to 6-month period
should be abnormal before considering
an individual to have moderately or se-
verely elevated albuminuria (1,12,13). Ex-
ercise within 24 h, infection, fever, heart
failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstrua-
tion, and marked hypertension may ele-
vate UACR independently of kidney
damage (14). Moreover, a recent analysis
showed variability in the measurement
of UACR when measured weekly over a
1-month period. Thus, repeated meas-
urements and tracking of trending over
time are needed to properly follow
changes in UACR (12).

Traditionally, eGFR is calculated from
serum creatinine using a validated for-
mula (15). eGFR is routinely reported by
laboratories along with serum creati-
nine, and eGFR calculators are available
online at nkdep.nih.gov. An eGFR persis-
tently <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or an
urinary albumin value of >30 mg/g creat-
inine is considered abnormal, though op-
timal thresholds for clinical diagnosis are
debated in older adults over age 70 years
(1,16). Historically, a correction factor for
muscle mass was included in a modiﬁed
equation for African American people;
however, race is a social and not a bio-
logic construct, making it problematic to
apply race to clinical algorithms. Hence,
the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equa-
tion was reﬁt without the race variable
and should be used for everyone (17,18).
Additionally, increased use of cystatin
C (another marker of eGFR) is suggested
in combination with serum creatinine be-
cause combining ﬁltration markers (creati-
nine and cystatin C) is more accurate and
would support better clinical decisions
than either marker alone.

DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY
DISEASE IN PEOPLE WITH
DIABETES
CKD in people with diabetes is usually a
clinical diagnosis made based on the pres-
ence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR
in the absence of signs or symptoms of
other primary causes of kidney damage.
The typical presentation of CKD in people
with diabetes is considered to include
long-standing duration of diabetes, reti-
nopathy, albuminuria without gross he-
maturia, and gradually progressive loss of
eGFR. However, signs of CKD may be pre-
sent at diagnosis or without retinopathy
in type 2 diabetes. Reduced eGFR without
albuminuria has been frequently reported
in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is be-
coming more common over time as the
prevalence of diabetes increases in the
U.S. (2,3,16,19–21). An active urinary sedi-
ment (containing red or white blood cells
or cellular casts), rapidly increasing albu-
minuria or total proteinuria, the presence
of nephrotic syndrome, rapidly decreasing
eGFR, or the absence of retinopathy (in
type 1 diabetes) suggests alternative or
additional causes of kidney disease. For in-
dividuals with these features, referral to a
nephrologist for further diagnosis, includ-
ing the possibility of kidney biopsy, should
be considered. It is rare for people with
type 1 diabetes to develop kidney disease
without retinopathy. In type 2 diabetes,
retinopathy is only moderately sensitive
and speciﬁc for CKD caused by diabetes,
as conﬁrmed by kidney biopsy (22). It can-
not be deﬁnitively stated that a person
with diabetes and CKD has CKD related to
diabetes unless the person has a kidney
biopsy, as there may be another cause or
multiple causes. Hence, without a biopsy, it
is recommended to state that the individual
has CKD in a person with diabetes. In most
people, there is no need for a kidney bi-
opsy, as the other possible diagnoses would
not change treatment. Referral to a ne-
phrologist should be done if there are any
reasons to consider another cause of CKD
in a person with diabetes (Table 11.1).

STAGING OF CHRONIC KIDNEY
DISEASE
Stage G1 and stage G2 CKD are deﬁned
by evidence of high albuminuria with
eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and stages
G3-G5 CKD are deﬁned by progressively
lower ranges of eGFR (23) (Fig. 11.1). At
any eGFR, the degree of albuminuria is

Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

chronic kidney disease and diabetes

associated with risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), CKD progression, and mortal-
ity (6). Therefore, there is an additional
subclassiﬁcation by level of urine albumin
(Fig. 11.1). Furthermore, Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) rec-
ommends a more comprehensive CKD
staging that incorporates albuminuria at
all stages of eGFR; this system is more
closely associated with risk but is also more
complex (1). Thus, based on the current
classiﬁcation system, both eGFR and albu-
minuria must be quantiﬁed to guide treat-
ment decisions. Quantiﬁcation of eGFR
levels is essential for modiﬁcations of medi-
cation dosages or restrictions of use (Fig.
11.1) (23,24), and the degree of albumin-
uria should inﬂuence the choice of antihy-
pertensive medications (see Section 10,
“Cardiovascular Disease and Risk
Management”) or glucose-lowering medi-
cations (see below). Observed history of
eGFR loss (which is also associated with risk
of CKD progression and other adverse
health outcomes) and cause of kidney dam-
age (including possible causes other than di-
abetes) may also affect these decisions (25).

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is diagnosed
by a sustained increase in serum creati-
nine over a short period of time, which
is also reﬂected as a rapid decrease in
eGFR (26,27). People with diabetes are at
higher risk of AKI than those without diabe-
tes (28). Other risk factors for AKI include
preexisting CKD, the use of medications
that cause kidney injury (e.g., nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drugs), certain intrave-
nous dyes (e.g., iodinated radiocontrast
agents) and the use of medications that
alter renal blood ﬂow and intrarenal he-
modynamics. In particular, many antihy-
pertensive medications (e.g., diuretics,
ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor
blockers [ARBs]) can reduce intravascular
volume, renal blood ﬂow, and/or

glomerular ﬁltration. There was concern
that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitors may promote AKI
through volume depletion, particularly
when combined with diuretics or other
medications that reduce glomerular ﬁltra-
tion; however, this has not been found to
be true in randomized controlled trials of
advanced kidney disease (29) or high CVD
risk with normal kidney function (30–32). It
is also noteworthy that the nonsteroidal
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
(MRAs) do not increase the risk of AKI when
used to slow kidney disease progression
(33). Timely identiﬁcation and treatment of
AKI is important because AKI is associated
with increased risks of progressive CKD and
other poor health outcomes (34).

Elevations in serum creatinine (up to
30% from baseline) with renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) blockers (such as ACE inhibi-
tors and ARBs) must not be confused
with AKI (35). An analysis of the Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
Blood Pressure (ACCORD BP) trial demon-
strated that participants randomized to in-
tensive blood pressure lowering with up
to a 30% increase in serum creatinine did
not have any increase in mortality or pro-
gressive kidney disease (36,37). Moreover,
a measure of markers for AKI showed no
signiﬁcant increase of any markers with
increased creatinine (37).

Accordingly, ACE inhibitors and ARBs
should not be discontinued for increases
in serum creatinine (<30%) in the ab-
sence of volume depletion.

SURVEILLANCE
Both albuminuria and eGFR should be
monitored annually to enable timely di-
agnosis of CKD, monitor progression of
CKD, detect superimposed kidney diseases
including AKI, assess risk of CKD complica-
tions, dose medications appropriately, and
determine whether nephrology referral is
needed. Among people with existing

kidney disease, albuminuria and eGFR may
change due to progression of CKD, develop-
ment of a separate superimposed cause of
kidney disease, AKI, or other effects of med-
ications, as noted above. Serum potassium
should also be monitored in individuals
treated with diuretics because these medi-
cations can cause hypokalemia, which is as-
sociated with cardiovascular risk and
mortality (38–40). Individuals with eGFR
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving ACE inhibi-
tors, ARBs, or MRAs should have serum po-
tassium measured periodically. Additionally,
people with this lower range of eGFR
should have their medication dosing veri-
ﬁed, their exposure to nephrotoxins (e.g.,
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs and
iodinated contrast) should be minimized,
and they should be evaluated for potential
CKD complications (Table 11.2).

There is a clear need for annual quanti-
tative assessment of UACR. This is espe-
cially true after a diagnosis of albuminuria,
institution of ACE inhibitors or ARB ther-
apy to maximum tolerated doses, and
achievement of blood pressure goals. Early
changes in kidney function may be de-
tected by increases in albuminuria before
changes in eGFR (41), and this also signiﬁ-
cantly affects cardiovascular risk. Contin-
ued surveillance can assess both response
to therapy and disease progression and
may aid in assessing participation in ACE
inhibitor or ARB therapy. In addition, in
clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB
therapy in people with type 2 diabetes,
reducing albuminuria to levels <300 mg/g
creatinine or by >30% from baseline has
been associated with improved kidney
and cardiovascular outcomes, leading
to the recommendation that medica-
tions should be titrated to maximize re-
duction in UACR (8). See Table 11.3 for
interventions that lower albuminuria.

Data from post hoc analyses demon-
strate less beneﬁt on cardiorenal out-
comes at half doses of RAS blockade (42).
In type 1 diabetes, remission of albumin-
uria may occur spontaneously, and cohort
studies evaluating associations of change
in albuminuria with clinical outcomes have
reported inconsistent results (43,44).

The prevalence of CKD complications
correlates with eGFR (40). When eGFR is
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, screening for com-
plications of CKD is indicated (Table 11.2).
Early vaccination against hepatitis B virus
is indicated in individuals likely to progress

Complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD) generally become prevalent when estimated
glomerular ﬁltration rate falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (stage G3 CKD or greater) and be-
come more common and severe as CKD progresses. Evaluation of elevated blood pressure
and volume overload should occur at every clinical contact possible; laboratory evaluations are
generally indicated every 6–12 months for stage G3 CKD, every 3–5 months for stage G4 CKD,
and every 1–3 months for stage G5 CKD, or as indicated to evaluate symptoms or changes in
therapy. 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D; PTH, parathyroid hormone.

Prevention
The only proven primary prevention inter-
ventions for CKD in people with diabetes
are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and
blood pressure management. There is no
evidence that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system inhibitors or any other interventions
prevent the development of CKD in the ab-
sence of hypertension or albuminuria. Thus,
the American Diabetes Association does not
recommend routine use of these medica-
tions solely for the purpose of prevention
of the development of CKD. In 2023, the
Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Dia-
betes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study
(GRADE) was published (45). This large
prospective study compared liraglutide,
sitagliptin, glimeperide, and insulin glar-
gine with respect to achieving and main-
taining A1C goals in people with type 2
diabetes treated with metformin mono-
therapy; kidney and cardiovascular end
points were examined as secondary out-
comes. A total of 5,047 participants were
enrolled from July 2013 to August 2017
and were followed for an average of

5 years. Almost all participants did not
have signs of kidney disease at the time
of enrollment. No differences between
the examined medications were observed,
which suggests that there were no unique
reno-protective effects among these medi-
cations for prevention. Of note, SGLT2 in-
hibitors were not included in the study, as
these medications were not
routinely
available at the time the study started.

INTERVENTIONS

Nutrition
For people with stages 3–5 non–dialysis-
dependent CKD, dietary protein intake
should be (cid:1)0.8 g/kg body weight per day
(the recommended daily allowance) (1).
Compared with higher levels of dietary
protein intake, this level slowed GFR de-
cline with evidence of a greater effect
over time. Higher levels of dietary protein
intake (>20% of daily calories from protein
or >1.3 g/kg/day) have been associated
with increased albuminuria, more rapid
kidney function loss, and CVD mortality
and therefore should be avoided. Reduc-
ing the amount of dietary protein below

0.8 g/kg/day is not recommended because
it does not alter blood glucose levels, car-
diovascular risk measures, or the course of
GFR decline (46). Some organizations rec-
ommend a lower protein intake (0.6–0.8 g/
kg/day). In particular, guidelines from the
National Kidney Foundation Kidney Dis-
ease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF
KDOQI) (47) and the International Soci-
ety of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism
(48) recommend a lower protein intake
level for reno-protection and state that
this lower level is relatively safe. How-
ever, for CKD in diabetes, the expert
grade is “opinion” only. The guidelines
note that the evidence for lower protein
intake in people with CKD has been pub-
lished for only those without diabetes,
which is graded Level 1A. Low-protein
eating patterns should only be followed
alongside guidance from a health care
professional experienced in managing nu-
trition for people with CKD.

Restriction of dietary sodium (to
<2,300 mg/day) may be useful to manage
blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular
risk (49,50), and individualization of dietary
potassium may be necessary to manage se-
rum potassium concentrations (28,38–40).
These interventions may be most important
for individuals with reduced eGFR, for whom
urinary excretion of sodium and potassium
may be impaired. For individuals on dialysis,
higher levels of dietary protein intake should
be considered since protein-energy wasting
is a major problem for some individuals
on dialysis (51). Recommendations for
dietary sodium and potassium intake
should be individualized based on comorbid
conditions, medication use, blood pressure,
and laboratory data.

Glycemic Goals
Intensive lowering of blood glucose with
the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia
has been shown in large, randomized stud-
ies to delay the onset and progression of al-
buminuria and reduce eGFR in people with
type 1 diabetes (52,53) and type 2 diabetes
(1,54–59). Insulin alone was used to lower
blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of
Diabetes Interventions and Complications
(EDIC) study of type 1 diabetes, while a vari-
ety of agents were used in clinical trials of
type 2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion
that lowering blood glucose itself helps pre-
vent CKD and its progression. The effects of
glucose-lowering therapies on CKD have
helped deﬁne A1C goals.

Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

The presence of CKD affects the risks
and beneﬁts of
intensive lowering of
blood glucose and a number of speciﬁc
glucose-lowering medications. Adverse
intensive management of
effects of
blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia and
mortality) were increased among people
with kidney disease at baseline (60).
Moreover, there is a lag time of at least 2
years in type 2 diabetes to over 10 years
in type 1 diabetes for the effects of in-
tensive glucose control to manifest as
improved eGFR outcomes (57,61,62).
Therefore, in some people with prevalent
CKD and substantial comorbidity, treat-
ment may be less intensive (i.e., A1C
goals may be higher) to decrease the risk
of hypoglycemia (1,63). A1C levels are
also less reliable at advanced CKD stages
(64,65).

Blood Pressure and Use of ACE
Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor
Blockers
ACE inhibitors and ARBs remain a main-
stay of management for people with
CKD with albuminuria and for the treat-
ment of hypertension in people with di-
abetes (with or without CKD in people
with diabetes). Indeed, all the trials that
evaluated the beneﬁts of SGLT2 inhibition
or nonsteroidal MRA effects were done in
individuals who were being treated with
an ACE inhibitor or ARB, in some trials up
to maximum tolerated doses.

Hypertension is a strong risk factor
for the development and progression of
CKD (66). Antihypertensive therapy re-
duces the risk of albuminuria (67–70),
and among people with type 1 or 2 di-
abetes with established CKD (eGFR
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR $300
mg/g creatinine), ACE inhibitor or ARB
therapy reduces the risk of progres-
sion to ESKD (71–80). Moreover, anti-
hypertensive therapy reduces the risk
of cardiovascular events (67).

A blood pressure level <130/80 mmHg
is recommended to reduce CVD mortality
and slow CKD progression among all peo-
ple with diabetes. Lower blood pressure
goals (e.g., <130/80 mmHg) should be
considered based on individual anticipated
beneﬁts and risks. People with CKD are at
increased risk of CKD progression (particu-
larly those with albuminuria) and CVD;
therefore, lower blood pressure goals may
be suitable in some cases, especially in in-
dividuals with severely elevated albumin-
uria ($300 mg/g creatinine).

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the pre-
ferred ﬁrst-line agents for blood pressure
treatment among people with diabetes,
hypertension, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2,
and UACR $300 mg/g creatinine because
of their proven beneﬁts for prevention of
CKD progression (71,72,74). ACE inhibitors
and ARBs are considered to have similar
beneﬁts (75,76) and risks. In the setting
of lower levels of albuminuria (30–299
mg/g creatinine), ACE inhibitor or ARB
therapy at maximum tolerated doses in
trials has reduced progression to more
advanced albuminuria ($300 mg/g creati-
nine), slowed CKD progression, and re-
duced cardiovascular events but has not
reduced progression to ESKD (74,77).
While ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often
prescribed for moderately increased albu-
minuria (30–299 mg/g creatinine) without
hypertension, outcome trials have not been
performed in this setting to determine
whether they improve kidney outcomes.
Moreover, two long-term, double-blind
studies demonstrated no renoprotective
effect of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs
among people with type 1 and type 2 dia-
betes who were normotensive with or
without high albuminuria (formerly microal-
buminuria, 30–299 mg/g creatinine) (78,79).
It should be noted that ACE inhibitors
and ARBs are commonly not dosed at
maximum tolerated doses because of
concerns that serum creatinine will rise.
As previously noted, not maximizing
these therapies for this reason would
be considered suboptimal care. Note
that in all clinical trials demonstrating
efﬁcacy of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in
slowing kidney disease progression, the
maximum tolerated doses were used—
not very low doses that do not provide
beneﬁt. Moreover, there are now stud-
ies demonstrating outcome beneﬁts on
both mortality and slowed CKD progres-
sion in people with diabetes who have
an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (80). Ad-
ditionally, when increases in serum cre-
atinine reach 30% without associated
hyperkalemia, RAS blockade should be
continued (36,81).

Two recent large retrospective analy-
ses provide additional support for the
aggressive use of ACE inhibitors and
ARBs in individuals with CKD. Ku et al.
(82) reviewed 17 trials that included
11,800 individuals with CKD (deﬁned as
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2); 82% had
diabetes. The authors reported that a
<13% decline in eGFR over a 3-month

period or a <21% decline in a 1-month
period was associated with better long-
term kidney outcomes. Hattori et al.
(83) evaluated 6,065 participants be-
tween 2005 and 2021 (approximately
40% had diabetes) with eGFR ranging
from 10 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who
had ACE inhibitors or ARBs stopped
(usually due to hyperkalemia or AKI)
and found that those who restarted the
ACE inhibitor or ARB had better long-term
kidney outcomes and lower mortality
(there was no signiﬁcant difference in hy-
perkalemia in those who restarted ACE in-
hibitors or ARBs). There is also an accom-
panying editorial that details the strengths
and weaknesses of the studies (84).

In the absence of kidney disease, ACE
inhibitors or ARBs are useful to manage
blood pressure but have not proven supe-
rior to alternative classes of antihyperten-
sive therapy, including thiazide-like diuretics
and dihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers (85). In a trial of people with
type 2 diabetes and normal urinary al-
bumin excretion, an ARB reduced or
suppressed the development of albu-
minuria but increased the rate of car-
diovascular events (86).
In a trial of
people with type 1 diabetes exhibiting
neither albuminuria nor hypertension,
ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not prevent
the development of glomerulopathy as-
sessed by kidney biopsy (78). This was
further supported by a similar trial
in
people with type 2 diabetes (79).

Two clinical trials studied the combi-
nations of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and
found no beneﬁts on CVD or CKD, and
the medication combination had higher
adverse event rates (hyperkalemia and/or
AKI) (87,88). Therefore, the combined use
of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be
avoided.

Direct Kidney Effects of
Glucose-Lowering Medications
Some glucose-lowering medications also
have effects on the kidney that are direct,
i.e., not mediated through glycemia. For
example, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce renal tu-
bular glucose reabsorption, weight, systemic
intraglomerular pressure,
blood pressure,
and albuminuria and slow GFR loss through
mechanisms that appear independent of
glycemia (31,89–92). Moreover, recent
data support the notion that SGLT2 inhib-
itors reduce oxidative stress in the kidney by
>50% and blunt increases in angiotensino-
gen as well as reduce NLRP3 inﬂammasome

activity (92–94). Glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) have
also been shown to improve kidney out-
comes (95–100). Kidney effects should
be considered when selecting agents
for glucose lowering (see Section 9,
“Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic
Treatment”).

Selection of Glucose-Lowering
Medications for People With Chronic
Kidney Disease
For people with type 2 diabetes and es-
tablished CKD, special considerations for
the selection of glucose-lowering medi-
cations include limitations to available
medications when eGFR is diminished
and a desire to mitigate risks of CKD
progression, CVD, and hypoglycemia
(101,102). Medication dosing may require
modiﬁcation with eGFR <60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (1). Figure 11.2 shows the
American Diabetes Association and

KDIGO consensus recommendation al-
gorithm for medications in people with
diabetes and CKD.

The FDA revised its guidance for the
use of metformin in CKD in 2016 (103),
recommending use of eGFR instead of se-
rum creatinine to guide treatment and ex-
panding the pool of people with kidney
disease for whom metformin treatment
should be considered. The revised FDA
guidance states that 1) metformin is con-
traindicated in individuals with an eGFR
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2, 2) eGFR should be
monitored while taking metformin, 3) the
beneﬁts and risks of continuing treatment
should be reassessed when eGFR falls to
<45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (104,105), 4) met-
formin should not be initiated for individu-
als with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2,
and 5) metformin should be temporarily dis-
continued at the time of or before iodinated
contrast imaging procedures in individuals
with eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

A number of recent studies have shown
cardiovascular protection from SGLT2 in-
hibitors and GLP-1 RAs as well as kidney
protection from SGLT2 inhibitors and from
GLP-1 RAs. Selection of which glucose-low-
ering medications to use should be based
on the usual criteria of an individual’s risks
(cardiovascular and kidney in addition to
glucose management) as well as considera-
tions of effects on weight, other adverse ef-
fects, individual preferences, and cost.

SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for
people with eGFR $20 mL/min/1.73 m2
and type 2 diabetes, as they slow CKD
progression and reduce heart failure
risk independent of glucose management
(106). GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardio-
vascular risk reduction if such risk is a pre-
dominant problem, as they reduce risks
of CVD events and hypoglycemia and
slow progression of CKD (100,107–110).

comes trials in people with type 2 diabetes

at high risk for CVD or with existing CVD
examined kidney effects as secondary out-
comes. These trials include EMPA-REG
OUTCOME [BI 10773 (Empagliﬂozin) Car-
diovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2
Diabetes Mellitus Patients], CANVAS
(Canagliﬂozin Cardiovascular Assessment
Study), LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Ac-
tion in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovas-
cular Outcome Results), and SUSTAIN-6
(Trial
to Evaluate Cardiovascular and
Other Long-term Outcomes With Sema-
glutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes)
(91,95,98,111). Speciﬁcally, compared with
placebo, empagliﬂozin reduced the risk
of incident or worsening nephropathy
(a composite of progression to UACR
>300 mg/g creatinine, doubling of se-
rum creatinine, ESKD, or death from
ESKD) by 39% and the risk of doubling of
serum creatinine accompanied by eGFR
#45 mL/min/1.73 m2 by 44%; canagliﬂo-
zin reduced the risk of progression of al-
buminuria by 27% and the risk of
reduction in eGFR, ESKD, or death from
ESKD by 40%; liraglutide reduced the risk
of new or worsening nephropathy (a
composite of persistent macroalbuminu-
ria, doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, or
death from ESKD) by 22%; and semaglutide
reduced the risk of new or worsening ne-
phropathy (a composite of persistent UACR
>300 mg/g creatinine, doubling of serum
creatinine, or ESKD) by 36% (each P <
0.01). These analyses were limited by evalu-
ation of study populations not selected pri-
marily for CKD and examination of kidney
effects as secondary outcomes.

Three large clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibi-
tors have focused on people with CKD and
assessment of primary kidney outcomes.
Canagliﬂozin and Renal Events in Diabetes
with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evalu-
ation (CREDENCE), a placebo-controlled trial
of canagliﬂozin among 4,401 adults with
type 2 diabetes, UACR $300–5,000 mg/g
creatinine, and eGFR range 30–90 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (mean eGFR 56 mL/min/1.73 m2
with a mean albuminuria level of >900
mg/day), had a primary composite end
point of ESKD, doubling of serum creati-
nine, or renal or cardiovascular death
(29,112). It was stopped early due to
positive efﬁcacy and showed a 32% risk
reduction for development of ESKD over
control (29). Additionally, the development
of the primary end point, which included di-
alysis for $30 days, kidney transplantation
or eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 sustained
for $30 days by central
laboratory

assessment, doubling from the baseline se-
rum creatinine average sustained for $30
days by central laboratory assessment, or
renal death or cardiovascular death, was re-
duced by 30%. This beneﬁt was on back-
ground ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in
>99% of the participants (29). More-
over, in this advanced CKD group, there
were clear beneﬁts on cardiovascular out-
comes demonstrating a 31% reduction in
cardiovascular death or heart failure hospi-
talization and a 20% reduction in cardiovas-
cular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
or nonfatal stroke (29,110,113).

A second trial in advanced CKD in peo-
ple with diabetes was the Dapagliﬂozin
and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in
Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) study
(114). This trial examined a cohort similar
to that in CREDENCE except 67.5% of the
participants had type 2 diabetes and CKD
(the other one-third had CKD without
type 2 diabetes), and the end points
were slightly different. The primary out-
come was time to the ﬁrst occurrence of
any of the components of the composite,
including $50% sustained decline in eGFR
or reaching ESKD or cardiovascular death,
or renal death. Secondary outcome meas-
ures included time to the ﬁrst occurrence
of any of the components of the compos-
ite kidney outcome ($50% sustained de-
cline in eGFR or reaching ESKD or renal
death), time to the ﬁrst occurrence of ei-
ther of the components of the cardiovas-
cular composite (cardiovascular death or
hospitalization for heart failure), and time
to death from any cause. The trial had
4,304 participants with a mean eGFR at
baseline of 43.1 ± 12.4 mL/min/1.73 m2
(range 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and a
median UACR of 949 mg/g (range 200–
5,000 mg/g). There was a signiﬁcant bene-
ﬁt by dapagliﬂozin for the primary end
point (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61 [95% CI
0.51–0.72]; P < 0.001) (114). The HR for
the kidney composite of a sustained de-
cline in eGFR of $50%, ESKD, or death
from renal causes was 0.56 (95% CI
0.45–0.68; P < 0.001). The HR for the
composite of death from cardiovascular
causes or hospitalization for heart failure
was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55–0.92; P = 0.009). Fi-
nally, all-cause mortality was decreased in
the dapagliﬂozin group compared with the
placebo group (P < 0.004).

The most recently published clinical
trial was EMPA-KIDNEY (Study of Heart
and Kidney Protection with Empagliﬂozin)
(115). This study enrolled participants

with kidney disease with an eGFR of at
least 20 but less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2
or who had an eGFR of at least 45 but
less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 with a
UACR of at least 200 mg/g creatinine. Ap-
proximately one-half of the 6,609 partici-
pants had diabetes. The empagliﬂozin-
treated participants had lower risk of pro-
gression of kidney disease and lower risk
of death from cardiovascular causes (HR
0.72 [95% CI 0.64–0.82]; P < 0.001).

With respect to cardiovascular outcomes,
SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated re-
duced risk of heart failure hospitalizations
and some also demonstrated cardiovascular
risk reduction. GLP-1 RAs have clearly
demonstrated cardiovascular beneﬁts.
(See Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease
and Risk Management,” for further de-
tailed discussion.)

Of note, while the glucose-lowering ef-
fects of SGLT2 inhibitors are blunted with
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the renal and
cardiovascular beneﬁts were still seen at
eGFR levels as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2
even with no signiﬁcant change in glucose
(29,31,52,63,98,111,114–116). Most par-
ticipants with CKD in these trials also had
diagnosed atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) at baseline, although
(cid:1)28% of CANVAS participants with CKD
did not have diagnosed ASCVD (32).

Based on evidence from the CREDENCE,
DAPA-CKD, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials, as
well as secondary analyses of cardiovascu-
lar outcomes trials with SGLT2 inhibitors,
cardiovascular and renal events are re-
duced with SGLT2 inhibitor use in individu-
als with an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2,
independent of glucose-lowering effects
(110,113).

The recently published FLOW study
demonstrated that the GLP-1 RA sema-
glutide had reno-protective effects in
people with CKD (100). The study en-
rolled 3,533 participants with signiﬁcant
kidney disease deﬁned by level of eGFR
and/or by level of albuminuria (of note,
all participants had an albuminuria level
of at least 100 mg/g). The primary out-
come was deﬁned as the ﬁrst major kid-
ney disease event (onset of >50% in
eGFR, onset of persistent eGFR of
<15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of dialy-
sis or transplant, renal death, and cardio-
vascular death). The study was stopped
early due to reaching a prespeciﬁed out-
come. There was a 24% lower HR for those
taking semaglutide compared with the pla-
cebo group. Of note, cardiovascular deaths

from the analysis, the HR for kidney spe-
ciﬁc events was 21% lower in those taking
semaglutide. Thus, the study supports a
beneﬁcial effect of semaglutide in slowing
decline in kidney function as well as being
cardioprotective in people with CKD and
type 2 diabetes. Of note, the participants
who took semaglutide had lower A1C,
lower blood pressure, and more weight
loss—all of which are beneﬁcial
for
slowing decline in kidney function and
reducing cardiovascular adverse events.
Whether this beneﬁcial combination of ef-
fects was the primary cause for the reno-
protective outcomes or whether there is a
unique reno-protective effect of semaglu-
tide remains to be determined.

Adverse event proﬁles of these agents
also must be considered. Please refer to
Table 9.2 for medication-speciﬁc factors,
including adverse event information, for
these agents. Additional clinical trials fo-
cusing on CKD and cardiovascular out-
comes in people with CKD are ongoing
and will be reported in the next few years.
For people with type 2 diabetes and
CKD, the selection of speciﬁc agents may
depend on comorbidity and CKD stage.
SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for
individuals at high risk of CKD progres-
sion (i.e., with albuminuria or a history
of documented eGFR loss) (Fig. 9.3). For
people with type 2 diabetes and CKD,
use of an SGLT2 inhibitor in individuals
with eGFR $20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is rec-
ommended to reduce CKD progression
and cardiovascular events. The reason
for the limit of eGFR is as follows. The
major clinical trials for SGLT2 inhibitors
that showed beneﬁt for CKD in people
with diabetes are CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD,
and EMPA-KIDNEY. CREDENCE enrollment
criteria included eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2
and UACR >300 mg/g (29,110). DAPA-
CKD enrolled individuals with eGFR
>25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR >200 mg/g.
Subgroup analyses from DAPA-CKD (117)
and analyses from the EMPEROR heart
failure trials suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors
are safe and effective at eGFR levels of
>20 mL/min/1.73 m2. The Empagliﬂozin
Outcome Trial
in Patients With Chronic
Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Frac-
tion (EMPEROR-Preserved) enrolled 5,998
participants (118), and the Empagliﬂozin
Outcome Trial
in Patients With Chronic
Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Frac-
tion (EMPEROR-Reduced) enrolled 3,730

participants (119); enrollment criteria in-
cluded eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2, but
efﬁcacy was seen at eGFR >20 mL/min/
1.73 m2 in people with heart failure. Most
recently, the EMPA-KIDNEY trial showed
efﬁcacy in participants with eGFR as low
as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 (115). Hence, the
new recommendation is to use SGLT2 in-
hibitors in individuals with eGFR as low as
20 mL/min/1.73 m2. In addition, the DE-
CLARE-TIMI 58 trial suggested effective-
ness in participants with normal urinary
albumin levels (120). In sum, for people
with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use of an
SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended to reduce
CKD progression and cardiovascular events
in people with an eGFR $20 mL/min/
1.73 m2.

Of note, GLP-1 RAs may also be used
at low eGFR for cardiovascular protec-
tion but may require dose adjustment
(121).

Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes
of Mineralocorticoid Receptor
Antagonists in Chronic Kidney Disease
MRAs historically have not been well
studied in people with diabetes and
CKD because of the risk of hyperkalemia
(122,123). However, data that do exist
suggest sustained beneﬁt on albumin-
uria reduction. There are two different
classes of MRAs, steroidal and nonste-
roidal, with one group not extrapolat-
able to the other (124). Late in 2020,
the results of the ﬁrst of two trials, the
Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and
Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Dis-
ease (FIDELIO-DKD) trial, which examined
the kidney effects of ﬁnerenone, demon-
strated a signiﬁcant reduction in CKD
progression and cardiovascular events in
people with diabetes and advanced CKD
(33,125). This trial had a primary end point
of time to ﬁrst occurrence of the compos-
ite end point of onset of kidney failure, a
sustained decrease of eGFR >40% from
baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal
death. A prespeciﬁed secondary outcome
was time to ﬁrst occurrence of the com-
posite end point of cardiovascular death or
nonfatal cardiovascular events (myocardial
infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for
heart failure). Other secondary outcomes
included all-cause mortality, time to all-
cause hospitalizations, and change in UACR
from baseline to month 4, and time to ﬁrst
occurrence of the following composite end
point: onset of kidney failure, a sustained

decrease in eGFR of $57% from baseline
over at least 4 weeks, or renal death.

The double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial randomized 5,734 people with CKD
and type 2 diabetes to receive ﬁnere-
none, a nonsteroidal MRA, or placebo.
Eligible participants had a UACR of 30 to
<300 mg/g, an eGFR of 25 to <60 mL/min/
1.73 m2, and diabetic retinopathy, or a
UACR of 300–5,000 mg/g and an eGFR of
25 to <75 mL/min/1.73 m2. The potassium
level had to be #4.8 mmol/L. The mean
age of participants was 65.6 years, and
30% were female. The mean eGFR was
44.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, and the mean albu-
minuria was 852 mg/g (interquartile range
446–1,634 mg/g). The primary end point
was reduced with ﬁnerenone compared
with placebo (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73–0.93];
P = 0.001), as was the key secondary com-
posite of cardiovascular outcomes (HR 0.86
[95% CI 0.75–0.99]; P = 0.03). Hyperkale-
mia resulted in 2.3% discontinuation in the
study group compared with 0.9% in the
placebo group. However, the study was
completed, and there were no deaths re-
lated to hyperkalemia. Of note, 4.5% of the
total group were being treated with SGLT2
inhibitors.

The Finerenone in Reducing Cardio-
vascular Mortality and Morbidity in Dia-
betic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial
assessed the safety and efﬁcacy of ﬁner-
enone in reducing cardiovascular events
among people with type 2 diabetes and
CKD with elevated UACR (30 to <300 mg/g
creatinine) and eGFR 25–90 mL/min/1.73
m2 (126). The potassium level had to be
#4.8 mmol/L The study randomized eligi-
ble subjects to either ﬁnerenone (n =
3,686) or placebo (n = 3,666). Participants
with an eGFR of 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m2
at the screening visit received an initial
dose at baseline of 10 mg once daily, and
if eGFR at screening was $60 mL/min/
1.73 m2, the initial dose was 20 mg once
daily. An increase in the dose from 10 to
20 mg once daily was encouraged after 1
month, provided the serum potassium
level was #4.8 mmol/L and eGFR was
stable. The mean age of participants was
64.1 years (31% were female), and the
median follow-up duration was 3.4 years.
The median A1C was 7.7%, the mean sys-
tolic blood pressure was 136 mmHg, and
the mean GFR was 67.8 mL/min/1.73 m2.
People with heart failure with a reduced
ejection fraction and uncontrolled hyper-
tension were excluded.

Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

The primary composite outcome was
cardiovascular death, myocardial
infarc-
tion, stroke, and hospitalization for heart
failure. The ﬁnerenone group showed a
13% reduction in the primary end point
compared with the placebo group (12.4%
vs. 14.2%; HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.76–0.98];
P = 0.03). This beneﬁt was primarily
driven by a reduction in heart failure hos-
pitalizations: 3.2% vs. 4.4% in the placebo
group (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56–0.90]).

Of the secondary outcomes, the most
noteworthy was a 36% reduction in
ESKD: 0.9% vs. 1.3% in the placebo
group (HR 0.64 [95% CI 0.41–0.995]).
There was a higher incidence of hyper-
kalemia in the ﬁnerenone group, 10.8%
vs. 5.3%, although only 1.2% of the
3,686 individuals on ﬁnerenone stopped
the study due to hyperkalemia.

The FIDELITY prespeciﬁed pooled efﬁ-
cacy and safety analysis incorporated in-
dividuals from both the FIGARO-DKD
and FIDELIO-DKD trials (N = 13,171) to al-
low for evaluation across the spectrum of
severity of CKD, since the populations
were different (with a slight overlap) and
the study designs were similar (127). The
analysis showed a 14% reduction in com-
posite cardiovascular death, nonfatal myo-
infarction, nonfatal stroke, and
cardial
hospitalization for heart failure for ﬁnere-
none vs. placebo (12.7% vs. 14.4%; HR
0.86 [95% CI 0.78–0.95]; P = 0.0018).

It also demonstrated a 23% reduction
in the composite kidney outcome, consist-
ing of sustained $57% decrease in eGFR
from baseline over $4 weeks, or renal
death, for ﬁnerenone vs. placebo (5.5%
vs. 7.1%; HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.670.88]; P =
0.0002).

The pooled FIDELITY trial analysis con-
ﬁrms and strengthens the positive car-
diovascular and kidney outcomes with
ﬁnerenone across the spectrum of CKD,
irrespective of baseline ASCVD history
(with the exclusion of those with heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction).

Of note, there has not been a direct
comparison of MRAs and SGLT2 inhibi-
tors. At this time, they can be used inter-
changeably or together for the goal of
slowing progression of CKD and providing
cardiovascular protection. There have also
been no studies directly comparing MRAs,
SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs. Health
care professionals should use their best
judgement as to which medication to pre-
scribe initially and in combination. As
these studies included
noted, all of

participants taking either an ACE inhibitor
or an ARB, often at maximally tolerated
doses.

REFERRAL TO A NEPHROLOGIST
Health care professionals should consider
referral to a nephrologist if the individual
with diabetes has continuously rising UACR
levels and/or continuously declining eGFR,
if there is uncertainty about the etiology of
kidney disease, for difﬁcult management
issues (anemia, secondary hyperpara-
thyroidism, signiﬁcant increases in albu-
minuria despite good blood pressure
management, metabolic bone disease,
resistant hypertension, or electrolyte dis-
turbances), or when there is advanced kid-
ney disease (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2)
requiring discussion of renal replacement
therapy for ESKD (1). The threshold for
referral may vary depending on the fre-
quency with which a health care profes-
sional encounters people with diabetes
and kidney disease. Consultation with a
nephrologist when stage 4 CKD develops
(eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) has been
found to reduce cost, improve quality of
care, and delay dialysis (128).

However, other specialists and health
care professionals should also educate
people with diabetes about the progres-
sive nature of CKD, the kidney preserva-
tion beneﬁts of proactive treatment of
blood pressure and blood glucose, and
the potential need for renal replace-
ment therapy.
