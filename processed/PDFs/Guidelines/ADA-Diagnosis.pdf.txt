The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes
the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the
components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to
evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an
interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of
Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA
standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA’s
clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee
members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to com-
ment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders of carbohydrate metabolism in
which glucose is both underutilized as an energy source and overproduced due to in-
appropriate gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in hyperglycemia (1). Diabe-
tes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous
plasma or increased A1C in the blood. Diabetes is classiﬁed conventionally into sev-
eral clinical categories (e.g., type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus,
and other speciﬁc types derived from other causes, such as monogenic diabetes, exo-
crine pancreatic disorders, and high-risk medications) (2).

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR DIABETES
Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria. Plasma glucose
criteria include either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG)
during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by
classic hyperglycemic symptoms (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight
loss) or hyperglycemic crises (i.e., diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar state [HHS]) (Table 2.1).

Recommendations
2.1a Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria. Plasma glucose
criteria include either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG)
during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied
by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises (Table 2.1). B
2.1b In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises),
diagnosis requires conﬁrmatory testing (Table 2.1). B

Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetes
FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagno-
sis. It should be noted that detection rates of different screening tests vary in both

Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Table 2.1—Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals

A1C $6.5% ($48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method

that is NGSP certiﬁed and standardized to the DCCT assay.*

FPG $126 mg/dL ($7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is deﬁned as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.*

OR

2-h PG $200 mg/dL ($11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as

described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous
glucose dissolved in water.*

OR

In an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random
plasma glucose $200 mg/dL ($11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without
regard to time since previous meal.

cose tolerance test; NGSP, National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; WHO, World
Health Organization; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose. *In the absence of unequivocal hypergly-
cemia, diagnosis requires two abnormal results from different tests which may be obtained
at the same time (e.g., A1C and FPG), or the same test at two different time points.

populations and individuals. FPG, 2-h PG,
and A1C reﬂect different aspects of glu-
cose metabolism, and diagnostic cut points
for the different tests will identify groups
with incomplete concordance (3). Com-
pared with FPG and A1C cut points, the
2-h PG value diagnoses more people
with prediabetes and diabetes (4). More-
over, the efﬁcacy of interventions for pri-
mary prevention of type 2 diabetes (i.e.,
preventing conversion of prediabetes to
type 2 diabetes) has been demonstrated
mainly among individuals with prediabe-
tes who have impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT) with or without elevated fasting
glucose, not for individuals with isolated
impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or for
those with prediabetes deﬁned by A1C
criteria (5–8).

The same tests may be used to screen
for and diagnose diabetes and to detect
individuals with prediabetes (9) (Table 2.1
and Table 2.2). Diabetes may be identi-
ﬁed anywhere along the spectrum of

clinical scenarios—in seemingly low-risk
individuals who happen to have glucose
testing, in individuals screened based on
diabetes risk assessment, and in symp-
tomatic individuals. There is presently
insufﬁcient evidence to support the use
of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
for screening or diagnosis of prediabetes
or diabetes. For additional details on the
evidence used to establish the criteria
for the diagnosis of diabetes or prediabe-
tes, see the American Diabetes Associa-
tion (ADA) position statement “Diagnosis
and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes Mellitus”
(2) and other reports (1,3,10,11).

Use of Fasting Plasma Glucose or
2-Hour Plasma Glucose for Screening
and Diagnosis of Diabetes
In the less common clinical scenario
where a person has classic hyperglyce-
mic symptoms (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia,
unexplained weight loss) or presents
with hyperglycemic crisis, measurement

coming disproportionately greater at the higher end of the range. FPG, fasting plasma glu-

of random plasma glucose is sufﬁcient
to diagnose diabetes (symptoms of hy-
perglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis plus
random plasma glucose $200 mg/dL
[$11.1 mmol/L]). In these cases, know-
ing the plasma glucose level is critical be-
in addition to conﬁrming that
cause,
symptoms are due to diabetes, it will in-
form management decisions. Health care
professionals may also want to know the
A1C to determine the chronicity of hyper-
glycemia. However, in an individual with-
out symptoms, FPG or 2-h PG can be used
for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. In
nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is
typically preferred for routine screening due
to the ease of administration (Table 2.3);
however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing pro-
tocol diagnoses more diabetes than the
other two tests and is preferentially rec-
ommended for screening for some condi-
tions (e.g., cystic ﬁbrosis-related diabetes
or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus).
In the absence of classic hyperglycemic
symptoms, repeat testing is required to
conﬁrm the diagnosis regardless of the
test used (see CONFIRMING THE DIAGNOSIS,
below).

An advantage of glucose testing is that
these assays are inexpensive and widely
available. Disadvantages include the high
diurnal variation in glucose and fasting re-
quirement. Individuals may have difﬁculty
fasting for the full 8-h period or may mis-
report their fasting status (Table 2.3). Re-
cent physical activity,
illness, or acute
stress can affect glucose concentrations.
Glycolysis is also an important and under-
recognized concern with glucose testing.
Glucose concentrations will be falsely low
if samples are not handled properly and
promptly prior to analysis (1).

People should follow a mixed eating
pattern with at least 150 g of carbohy-
drates on the 3 days prior to OGTT
(12–14). Antecedent carbohydrate re-
striction in the days prior to OGTT can
falsely elevate postchallenge glucose lev-
els, potentially resulting in a false-positive
OGTT (12).

Use of A1C for Screening and
Diagnosis of Diabetes

Recommendations

formed using a method that is certi-
ﬁed by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program (NGSP) as

trimesters and the postpartum period),
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deﬁciency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent
blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis,

or erythropoietin therapy, plasma
glucose criteria should be used to
diagnose diabetes. B

The A1C test should be performed using a
method that is certiﬁed by the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program
(NGSP)
(ngsp.org) and standardized or
traceable to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay.
Outside the U.S., some assays are NGSP
certiﬁed but many more are International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) cer-
tiﬁed (a similarly stringent process) (1).

Point-of-care A1C assays may be NGSP
certiﬁed and cleared by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in
monitoring glycemic management in peo-
ple with diabetes in both Clinical Labora-
tory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–
regulated and CLIA-waived settings. FDA-
approved point-of-care A1C testing can
be used in laboratories or sites that are
CLIA certiﬁed, are inspected, and meet the
CLIA quality standards. These standards

include speciﬁed personnel requirements
(including documented annual compe-
tency assessments) and participation three
times per year in an approved proﬁciency
testing program (15–18).

A1C has several advantages compared
with FPG and OGTT, including greater con-
venience (fasting is not required), greater
preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-
day perturbations during stress, changes
in nutrition, or illness. However, it should
be noted that there is lower sensitivity
of A1C at the designated cut point com-
pared with that of 2-h PG as well as lim-
ited access in some parts of the world
(Table 2.3).

A1C reﬂects glucose bound to hemoglo-
bin over the life span of the erythrocyte
((cid:1)120 days) and is thus a “weighted” av-
erage that is more heavily affected by re-
cent blood glucose exposure. This means
that clinically meaningful changes in A1C
can be seen in <120 days. A1C is an indi-
rect measure of glucose exposure, and fac-
tors that affect hemoglobin concentrations
or erythrocyte turnover can affect A1C

Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

(e.g., thalassemia or folate deﬁciency)
(Table 2.3). A1C may not be a suitable
diagnostic test in people with anemia,
people treated with erythropoietin, or
people undergoing hemodialysis or HIV
treatment (1,19,20). Some hemoglobin
variants can interfere with A1C test re-
sults, but this depends on the speciﬁc as-
say. For individuals with a hemoglobin
variant but normal red blood cell turn-
over, such as those with the sickle cell
trait, an A1C assay without interfer-
ence from hemoglobin variants should
be used. An updated list of A1C assays
with interferences is available at ngsp
.org/interf.asp. Another genetic vari-
ant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehy-
drogenase G202A, carried by 11% of
African American individuals in the U.S., is
associated with a decrease in A1C of
about 0.8% in homozygous men and
0.7% in homozygous women compared
with levels in individuals without the vari-
ant (21).

There is controversy regarding racial dif-
ferences in A1C. Studies have found that
African American individuals have slightly
higher A1C levels than non-Hispanic White
or Hispanic people (22–25). The glucose-
independent racial difference in A1C is
small ((cid:1)0.3 percentage points) and may
reﬂect genetic differences in hemoglobin
or red cell turnover that vary by ances-
try. There is an emerging understanding
of the genetic determinants of A1C (21),
but the ﬁeld lacks adequate genetic
data in diverse populations (26,27).
While some genetic variants might be
more common in certain race or an-
cestry groups, it is important that we
do not use race or ancestry as proxies
for poorly understood genetic differ-
ences. Reassuringly, studies have shown
that the association of A1C with risk for
complications appears to be similar in
African American and non-Hispanic White
populations (28).

Confirming the Diagnosis
Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis
(e.g., individual with classic symptoms of
hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis and
random plasma glucose $200 mg/dL
[$11.1 mmol/L]), conﬁrmation is neces-
sary to establish the diagnosis. This can be
accomplished by two abnormal screening
test results, measured either at the same
time (29) or at two different time points.

If using samples at two different time
points, it is recommended that the sec-
ond test, which may be either a repeat of
the initial test or a different test, be per-
formed in a timely manner. For example,
if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a
repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), the
diagnosis of diabetes is conﬁrmed. Two
different tests (such as A1C and FPG)
both having results above the diagnostic
threshold when collected at the same
time or at two different time points
would also conﬁrm the diagnosis. On the
other hand, if an individual has discor-
dant results from two different tests,
then the test result that is above the diag-
nostic cut point should be repeated, with
careful consideration of factors that may
affect measured A1C or glucose levels. The
diagnosis is made based on the conﬁrma-
tory screening test. For example, if an indi-
vidual meets the diabetes criterion of A1C
(two results $6.5% [$48 mmol/mol]) but
not FPG (<126 mg/dL [<7.0 mmol/L]),
that person should nevertheless be consid-
ered to have diabetes.

If individuals have test results near
the margins of the diagnostic threshold,
the health care professional should edu-
cate the individual about the onset of
possible hyperglycemic symptoms and
repeat the test in 3–6 months.

Consistent and substantial discor-
dance between glucose values and
A1C test results should prompt addi-
tional follow-up to determine the un-
derlying reason for
the discrepancy
(including evaluation for the possibility
of a problem or interference with either
test) and whether it has clinical implica-
tions for the individual (Table 2.3). In addi-
tion, consider other biomarkers, such as
fructosamine and glycated albumin, which
are alternative measures of chronic hy-
perglycemia that are approved for clinical
use for monitoring glycemic management
in people with diabetes.

CLASSIFICATION

Recommendation
2.5 Classify people with hyperglycemia
into appropriate diagnostic categories
to aid in personalized management. E

Diabetes is classiﬁed conventionally into
several clinical categories, although these
are being reconsidered based on genetic,

metabolomic, and other characteristics
and pathophysiology (1):

1. Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune
b-cell destruction, usually leading to
absolute insulin deﬁciency,
including
latent autoimmune diabetes in adults)
2. Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoim-
mune progressive loss of adequate
b-cell insulin secretion, frequently on
the background of insulin resistance)
3. Speciﬁc types of diabetes due to other
causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syn-
dromes, diseases of the exocrine pan-
creas, and drug- or chemical-induced
diabetes

4. Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabe-
tes diagnosed in the second or third
trimester of pregnancy that was not
clearly overt diabetes prior to gesta-
tion or other types of diabetes occur-
ring throughout pregnancy, such as
type 1 diabetes).

Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are
heterogeneous diseases in which clinical
presentation and disease progression
may vary considerably. Classiﬁcation is
important for determining personalized
therapy, but some individuals cannot be
clearly classiﬁed as having type 1 or type 2
diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The tra-
ditional paradigms of type 2 diabetes
having onset only in adults and type 1 di-
abetes having onset only in children are
not accurate, as both diseases occur in
all age-groups. Children with type 1 dia-
betes often present with the hallmark
symptoms of polyuria/polydipsia, and
approximately half present with DKA
(30–32). The onset of type 1 diabetes
may be more variable in adults; they
may not present with the classic symp-
toms seen in children and may progress
to insulin replacement more slowly (33–35).
The features most useful in determination
of type 1 diabetes include younger age at
diagnosis (<35 years) with lower BMI
(<25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ke-
toacidosis, and plasma glucose >360 mg/dL
(>20 mmol/L) at presentation (36) (Fig. 2.1).
Other features classically associated with
type 1 diabetes, such as ketosis without
acidosis, osmotic symptoms, family history,
or a history of autoimmune diseases, are
weak discriminators. Occasionally, people
with type 2 diabetes may present with
DKA (37), particularly members of certain
racial, ethnic, and ancestral groups (e.g.,
African American and Hispanic/Latino

1No single clinical feature conﬁrms type 1 diabetes in isolation. 2Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) should be the primary antibody measured
and, if negative, should be followed by islet tyrosine phosphatase 2 (IA-2) and/or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) where these tests are available. In indi-
viduals who have not been treated with insulin, antibodies against insulin may also be useful. In those diagnosed at <35 years of age who have no
clinical features of type 2 diabetes or monogenic diabetes, a negative result does not change the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, since 5–10% of peo-
ple with type 1 diabetes do not have antibodies. 3Monogenic diabetes is suggested by the presence of one or more of the following features: A1C
<58 mmol/mol (<7.5%) at diagnosis, one parent with diabetes, features of a speciﬁc monogenic cause (e.g., renal cysts, partial lipodystrophy,
maternally inherited deafness, and severe insulin resistance in the absence of obesity), and monogenic diabetes prediction model probability >5%
(diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app/ModyCalculator). 4A C-peptide test is only indicated in people receiving insulin treatment. A random sam-
ple (with concurrent glucose) within 5 h of eating can replace a formal C-peptide stimulation test in the context of classiﬁcation. If the result is
$600 pmol/L ($1.8 ng/mL), the circumstances of testing do not matter. If the result is <600 pmol/L (<1.8 ng/mL) and the concurrent glucose is
<4 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) or the person may have been fasting, consider repeating the test. Results showing very low levels (e.g., <80 pmol/L
[<0.24 ng/mL]) do not need to be repeated. Where a person is insulin treated, C-peptide must be measured prior to insulin discontinuation to ex-
clude severe insulin deﬁciency. Do not test C-peptide within 2 weeks of a hyperglycemic emergency. 5Features of type 2 diabetes include increased
BMI ($25 kg/m2), absence of weight loss, absence of ketoacidosis, and less marked hyperglycemia. Less discriminatory features include non-White
ethnicity, family history, longer duration and milder severity of symptoms prior to presentation, features of metabolic syndrome, and absence of a
family history of autoimmunity. 6If genetic testing does not conﬁrm monogenic diabetes, the classiﬁcation is unclear and a clinical decision should
be made about treatment. 7Type 2 diabetes should be strongly considered in older individuals. In some cases, investigation for pancreatic or other
types of diabetes may be appropriate. 8A person with possible type 1 diabetes who is not treated with insulin will require careful monitoring and
education so that insulin can be rapidly initiated in the event of glycemic deterioration. 9C-peptide values 200–600 pmol/L (0.6–1.8 ng/mL) are
usually consistent with type 1 diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young but may occur in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, particularly in
people with normal or low BMI or after long duration. Reprinted and adapted from Holt et al. (36).

adults), who may present with ketosis-
prone type 2 diabetes (30). This form of
diabetes is strongly inherited and is not

HLA associated. An absolute requirement for
insulin replacement therapy in affected indi-
viduals may be intermittent. It is important

for health care professionals to realize
that classiﬁcation of diabetes type is not
always straightforward at presentation

Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

and that misdiagnosis is common and can
occur in (cid:1)40% of adults with new type 1
diabetes (e.g., adults with type 1 diabe-
tes misdiagnosed as having type 2 dia-
betes). In comparison, individuals with
maturity-onset diabetes of the young
(MODY) may be misdiagnosed as having
type 1 diabetes (36). Although difﬁcul-
ties in distinguishing diabetes type may
occur in all age-groups at onset, the di-
agnosis generally becomes more obvious
over time in people with b-cell deﬁciency
as the degree of b-cell deﬁciency be-
comes clear (Fig. 2.1). One useful clinical
tool for distinguishing diabetes type is
the AABBCC approach: Age (e.g., for indi-
viduals <35 years old, consider type 1
diabetes); Autoimmunity (e.g., per-
sonal or family history of autoimmune
disease or polyglandular autoimmune
syndromes); Body habitus (e.g., BMI
<25 kg/m2); Background (e.g., family his-
tory of type 1 diabetes); Control (pre-
ferred term is “goal,” i.e., the inability to
achieve glycemic goals on noninsulin ther-
apies); and Comorbidities (e.g., treatment
with immune checkpoint inhibitors for
cancer can cause acute autoimmune
type 1 diabetes) (36).

In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
genetic and environmental factors can
result in the progressive loss of b-cell
mass and/or function that manifests
clinically as hyperglycemia. Once hyper-
glycemia occurs, people with all forms
of diabetes are at risk for developing
the same chronic complications, although
rates of progression may differ. The iden-
tiﬁcation of individualized therapies for
diabetes in the future will be informed
by better characterization of the many
paths to b-cell demise or dysfunction
(38). Across the globe, many groups are
working on combining clinical, patho-
physiological, and genetic characteristics
to more precisely deﬁne the subsets of
diabetes that are currently clustered
into the type 1 diabetes versus type 2
diabetes nomenclature with the goal of
optimizing personalized treatment ap-
proaches (39). A diagnosis of type 1 dia-
betes does not preclude also having
features classically associated with type 2
diabetes (e.g.,
insulin resistance, obe-
sity, and other metabolic abnormalities),
and until more precise subsets are used
in clinical practice, it may be appropriate to
categorize such an individual as having fea-
tures of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes to
facilitate access to appropriate treatment

(e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ago-
nist [GLP-1 RA] or sodium–glucose cotrans-
porter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitor therapies for
potential weight and other cardiometa-
bolic beneﬁts) and monitoring systems.
Characterization of the underlying
pathophysiology is more precisely de-
veloped in type 1 diabetes than in type 2
It is clear from prospective
diabetes.
studies that the persistent presence of
two or more islet autoantibodies is a
near-certain predictor of clinical diabe-
tes (40). In at-risk cohorts followed from
birth or a very young age, seroconver-
sion rarely occurs before 6 months of
age and there is a peak in seroconver-
sion between 9 and 24 months of age
(41–43). The rate of progression is de-
pendent on the age at ﬁrst detection of
an autoantibody, number of autoanti-
bodies, autoantibody speciﬁcity, and au-
toantibody titer. Glucose and A1C levels
may rise well before the clinical onset
of diabetes (e.g., changes in FPG and
2-h PG can occur about 6 months be-
fore diagnosis) (44), making diagnosis
feasible under ideal situations of serial
monitoring of individuals at high risk of
type 1 diabetes before the onset of
DKA. Three distinct stages of type 1 di-
abetes have been deﬁned (Table 2.4)
and serve as a framework for research
and regulatory decision-making (38,45).
There is debate as to whether slowly
progressive autoimmune diabetes with
an adult onset should be termed latent
autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)
or type 1 diabetes. The clinical priority
with detection of LADA is awareness
that slow autoimmune b-cell destruc-
tion can occur in adults, leading to a
long duration of marginal insulin secre-
tory capacity. For this classiﬁcation, all
forms of diabetes mediated by autoim-
mune b-cell destruction independent of
age of onset are included under the ru-
bric of type 1 diabetes. Use of the term
LADA is common and acceptable in clini-
cal practice and has the practical impact
of heightening awareness of a popula-
tion of adults likely to have progressive
autoimmune b-cell destruction (46), thus
accelerating insulin initiation prior to de-
terioration of glucose management or
development of DKA (34,47). At the
same time, there is evidence that ap-
plication of only a single imperfect au-
toantibody test for determining LADA
classiﬁcation may lead to misclassiﬁcation
of some individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Diagnostic accuracy may be improved
by using higher-speciﬁcity tests, using
conﬁrmatory testing for other autoanti-
bodies, and restricting testing to those
with clinical features suggestive of au-
toimmune diabetes (48).

The paths to b-cell demise and dys-
function are less well deﬁned in type 2
diabetes, but deﬁcient b-cell
insulin
secretion, frequently in the setting of
insulin resistance, appears to be the
common denominator. Type 2 diabe-
tes is associated with insulin secretory
defects related to genetic predisposi-
tion, epigenetic changes, inﬂammation,
and metabolic stress. Future classiﬁca-
tion schemes for diabetes will likely focus
on the pathophysiology of the underlying
b-cell dysfunction (38,49–52).

TYPE 1 DIABETES

Recommendations
2.6 Screening for presymptomatic
type 1 diabetes may be done by de-
tection of autoantibodies to insulin,
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD),
islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc trans-
porter 8 (ZnT8). B
2.7 Autoantibody-based screening for
presymptomatic type 1 diabetes should
be offered to those with a family his-
tory of type 1 diabetes or otherwise
known elevated genetic risk. B
2.8 Having multiple conﬁrmed islet
autoantibodies is a risk factor for clin-
ical diabetes. Testing for dysglyce-
mia may be used to further forecast
near-term risk (Table 2.4). When mul-
tiple islet autoantibodies are identi-
ﬁed, referral to a specialized center
for further evaluation and/or consid-
eration of a clinical trial or approved
therapy to potentially delay develop-
ment of clinical diabetes should be
considered. B
2.9 Standardized islet autoantibody
tests are recommended for classiﬁca-
tion of diabetes in adults who have
phenotypic risk factors that overlap
with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g.,
younger age at diagnosis, uninten-
tional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or
short time to insulin treatment). E

Immune-Mediated Diabetes

for 5–10% of diabetes and is caused by

autoimmune destruction of the pancre-
atic b-cells. Autoimmune markers include
islet cell autoantibodies and autoantibod-
ies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
(such as GAD65), insulin, the tyrosine
phosphatases islet antigen 2 (IA-2) and
IA-2b, and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). Nu-
merous clinical studies are being conducted
to test various methods of preventing or
delaying type 1 diabetes in those with ev-
idence of islet autoimmunity (trialnet.org/
(40–42,
our-research/prevention-studies)
47,53,54). The disease has strong HLA as-
sociations, with linkage to the DQB1 and
DRB1 haplotypes, and genetic screening
has been used in some research studies
to identify high-risk populations. Speciﬁc
alleles in these genes can be either pre-
disposing (e.g., DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201
[DR3-DQ2] and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302
[DR4-DQ8]) or protective (e.g., DRB1*1501
and DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602). Stage 1 of
type 1 diabetes is deﬁned by the presence
of two or more of these autoantibodies
and normoglycemia (Table 2.4). At stage 1,
the 5-year risk of developing symptomatic
type 1 diabetes is (cid:1)44% overall but varies
considerably based on number, titer, and
speciﬁcity of autoantibodies as well as age
of seroconversion and genetic risk (45).
Stage 2 includes individuals with multiple
islet autoantibodies and dysglycemia not
yet diagnostic of diabetes (dysglycemia
can be deﬁned by one or more criteria as
outlined in Table 2.4). At stage 2 of the
disease, there is (cid:1)60% risk by 2 years
and (cid:1)75% risk within 5 years of develop-
ing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes
(55,56). A consensus guidance provides
expert recommendations on what should
be monitored and how often these factors

should be monitored in individuals with
presymptomatic type 1 diabetes (57).

The rate of b-cell destruction is quite
variable, being rapid in some individuals
(particularly but not exclusively in infants
and children) and slow in others (mainly
but not exclusively adults) (44,58). Chil-
dren and adolescents often present with
DKA as the ﬁrst manifestation of the dis-
ease, and rates in the U.S. have in-
creased over the past 20 years (30–32).
Others have modest fasting hyperglyce-
mia that can rapidly change to severe
hyperglycemia and/or DKA with infection
or other stress. Adults may retain sufﬁ-
cient b-cell function to prevent DKA for
many years; such individuals may have
remission characterized by decreased in-
sulin needs for months or years, eventu-
ally become dependent on insulin for
survival, and are at risk for DKA (33–35,
59,60). At this later stage of the disease,
there is little or no insulin secretion, as
manifested by low or undetectable levels
of plasma C-peptide. Immune-mediated
diabetes is the most common form of
diabetes in childhood and adolescence,
but it can occur at any age. Autoimmune
destruction of b-cells has multiple ge-
netic factors and is also related to envi-
ronmental factors that are still poorly
deﬁned. Although individuals did not clas-
sically have obesity when they presented
with type 1 diabetes, obesity is increas-
ingly common in the general population;
as such, obesity should not preclude
testing for type 1 diabetes. People with
type 1 diabetes are also prone to other
autoimmune disorders, such as Hashi-
moto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac

disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, auto-
immune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis,
and pernicious anemia (see Section 4,
“Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and
Assessment of Comorbidities”). Type 1
diabetes can be associated with monogenic
polyglandular autoimmune syndromes,
including immune dysregulation, polyen-
docrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked
(IPEX) syndrome, which is an early-onset
systemic autoimmune, genetic disorder
caused by mutation of the forkhead box
protein 3 (FOXP3) gene, and another dis-
order caused by the autoimmune regula-
tor (AIRE) gene mutation (61,62).

Introduction of immunotherapy, spe-
ciﬁcally checkpoint inhibitors, for cancer
treatment has led to unexpected adverse
events, including immune system activa-
tion precipitating autoimmune disease.
Fulminant onset of type 1 diabetes can
occur, with DKA and low or undetectable
levels of C-peptide as a marker of endog-
enous b-cell function (63–65). Fewer than
half of these individuals have autoanti-
bodies that are seen in type 1 diabetes,
supporting alternate pathobiology. This
immune-related adverse event occurs in
just under 1% of checkpoint inhibitor–
treated individuals but most commonly
occurs with agents that block the pro-
grammed cell death protein 1/programmed
cell death ligand 1 pathway alone or in
combination with other checkpoint in-
hibitors (66). To date, the majority of im-
mune checkpoint inhibitor–related cases
of type 1 diabetes occur in people with
high-risk HLA susceptibility haplotype for
type 1 diabetes; however, people with
either a neutral or typically protective

HLA haplotype for type 1 diabetes can
also develop checkpoint inhibitor–asso-
ciated type 1 diabetes (67). To date, risk
cannot be predicted by family history or
autoantibodies, so all health care profes-
sionals administering these medications
or caring for people who have a history
of current or past exposure to these
agents should be mindful of this adverse
effect and educate and monitor individ-
uals appropriately.

A number of viruses have been associ-
ated with type 1 diabetes, including enter-
oviruses such as Coxsackievirus B. During
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, numbers of cases of hypergly-
cemia, DKA, and new diabetes increased,
suggesting that severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a
trigger for or can unmask type 1 diabetes
(68). Possible mechanisms of b-cell dam-
age include virus-triggered b-cell death,
immune-mediated loss of pancreatic
b-cells, and damage to b-cells because
of infection of surrounding exocrine
cells. The cytokine storm associated
with COVID-19 infection is a highly inﬂam-
matory state that could also contribute.
To better characterize and understand the
pathogenesis of new-onset COVID-19–
related diabetes, a global registry, CoviDIAB,
has been established (69).

Idiopathic Type 1 Diabetes
Some forms of type 1 diabetes have no
known etiologies. Individuals have perma-
nent insulinopenia and are prone to DKA
but have no evidence of b-cell autoimmu-
nity. However, only a minority of people
with type 1 diabetes fall into this category.

Screening for Type 1 Diabetes Risk
The incidence and prevalence of type 1
diabetes are increasing (70). People with
type 1 diabetes often present with acute
symptoms of diabetes and markedly ele-
vated blood glucose levels, and 25–50%
are diagnosed with life-threatening DKA
(30–32). Family history of type 1 diabetes
increases the risk of developing type 1
diabetes compared with the general pop-
ulation, but the majority, (cid:1)90%, of indi-
viduals who develop type 1 diabetes do
not have a known relative with the dis-
ease. Multiple studies indicate that mea-
suring islet autoantibodies in relatives of
those with type 1 diabetes (45), in chil-
dren from the general population (71,72),
or in children from the general population

with high genetic risk (73) can identify
many individuals who will develop type 1
diabetes. A study reported the risk of pro-
gression to type 1 diabetes from the time
of seroconversion to autoantibody posi-
tivity in three pediatric cohorts from
Finland, Germany, and the U.S. Of the
585 children who developed more than
two autoantibodies, nearly 70% devel-
oped type 1 diabetes within 10 years
and 84% within 15 years (40). These
ﬁndings are highly signiﬁcant, because
while the German group was recruited
from offspring of parents with type 1 di-
abetes, the Finnish and American groups
were recruited from the general popula-
tion. Remarkably, the ﬁndings in all three
groups were the same, suggesting that
the same sequence of events led to clini-
cal disease in both “sporadic” and famil-
ial cases of type 1 diabetes. Indeed, the
risk of type 1 diabetes increases as the
number of relevant autoantibodies de-
tected increases (53,74,75). In The Envi-
ronmental Determinants of Diabetes in
the Young (TEDDY) study, type 1 diabetes
developed in 21% of 363 subjects with
at least one autoantibody at 3 years of
age (76). Such testing, coupled with edu-
cation about diabetes symptoms and
close follow-up, has been shown to en-
able earlier diagnosis and to prevent
DKA (77,78). In several cohort studies,
up to 50% of children with only a single
autoantibody revert to being islet au-
toantibody negative during follow-up
(79,80). Therefore,
it is recommended
that the ﬁrst autoantibody-positive test
be conﬁrmed with a second test within
3 months, preferably in a laboratory that
meets the performance standards set by
the Islet Autoantibody Standardization
Program (IASP) (57).

Type 1 diabetes genetic risk scores
have been used in newborn screening
to identify those at risk for future pre-
sentation of the disease. In a simulation
using one such genetic risk score, the
majority of those who would go on to
develop type 1 diabetes, >77%, could
be identiﬁed within just 10% of the gen-
eral population, identifying a subset who
may most beneﬁt from autoantibody
testing (81). As many genetic risk studies
have been performed in populations of
European ancestry and discriminatory
ability may differ in those of different
ancestry, more large case-control co-
horts from non-European populations
are still needed (82).

Screening programs are available in
Europe (e.g., Fr1da and gppad.org),
Australia (e.g., type1screen.org), and the
U.S. (e.g., trialnet.org, askhealth.org, and
cascadekids.org). General population-based
screening programs may offer broader
testing where high-quality, validated assays
and resources for appropriate follow-up of
results are available, with several coun-
tries considering making such testing part
of standard care. In 2023, Italy introduced
nationwide screening for type 1 diabetes
and celiac disease in the general popula-
tion aged 1–17 years (83). Individuals who
test autoantibody positive should be
provided with or referred for counseling
about the risk of developing diabetes,
diabetes symptoms, and DKA prevention
and should be given consideration for
referral to a specialized center for further
evaluation and/or consideration of a clini-
cal trial or approved therapy to potentially
delay development of clinical diabetes (84).

PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2
DIABETES

Recommendations
2.10 Screening for risk of prediabe-
tes and type 2 diabetes with an as-
sessment of risk factors or validated
risk calculator should be done in
asymptomatic adults. B
2.11a Testing for prediabetes or type 2
diabetes in asymptomatic people
should be considered in adults of
any age with overweight or obesity
who have one or more risk factors
(Table 2.5). B
2.11b For all other people, screen-
ing should begin at age 35 years. B
2.11c In people without prediabetes
or diabetes after screening, repeat
screening recommended at a mini-
mum of 3-year intervals is reasonable,
sooner with symptoms or change in
risk (e.g., weight gain). C
2.12 To screen for prediabetes and
type 2 diabetes, FPG, 2-h PG during
75-g OGTT, and A1C are each appro-
priate (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). B
2.13 When using OGTT as a screen-
ing tool for prediabetes or diabetes,
adequate carbohydrate intake (at least
150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days
prior to testing. E
2.14 Risk-based screening for predia-
betes or type 2 diabetes should be
considered after the onset of puberty
or after 10 years of age, whichever

with numerous risk factors.

Prediabetes
Prediabetes is the term used for individ-
uals whose glucose or A1C levels do not
meet the criteria for diabetes yet have
abnormal carbohydrate metabolism that
results in elevated glucose levels (dysglyce-
mia) intermediate between normoglycemia
and diabetes (28,85). People with predia-
betes are deﬁned by the presence of IFG
and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47
mmol/mol) (Table 2.2). As prediabetes is
an intermediate state between normo-
glycemia and diabetes, it is a signiﬁcant
risk factor for progression to diabetes
as well as cardiovascular disease and
several other cardiometabolic outcomes.
Criteria for screening for diabetes or pre-
diabetes in asymptomatic adults are out-
lined in Table 2.5. Prediabetes is associated
with obesity (especially abdominal or
visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with
high triglycerides and/or low HDL cho-
lesterol, and hypertension. The presence
of prediabetes should prompt compre-
hensive screening for cardiovascular risk
factors.

Diagnosis of Prediabetes
IFG is deﬁned as FPG levels from 100 to
125 mg/dL (from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)
(78,84) and IGT as 2-h PG levels during
75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL
(from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) (10). It should
be noted that the World Health Organi-
zation and a number of diabetes organ-
izations deﬁne the IFG lower limit at
110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). The ADA also
initially endorsed this IFG lower limit in
1997 (10). However, in 2003 the ADA
adopted the new range of 100–125 mg/dL
(5.6–6.9 mmol/L) to better deﬁne IFG so
that the population risk of developing dia-
betes with IFG would be similar to that
with IGT (11).

As with the glucose measures, several
prospective studies that used A1C to pre-
dict the progression to diabetes demon-
strated a strong, continuous curvilinear
association between A1C and subsequent
diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203
individuals from 16 cohort studies with
a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years
(range 2.8–12 years), those with A1C be-
tween 5.5% and 6.0% (between 37 and
42 mmol/mol) had a substantially in-
creased risk of diabetes (5-year incidence
from 9% to 25%). Those with an A1C
range of 6.0–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol)
had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes
between 25% and 50% and a relative risk

20 times higher than that with A1C of
5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (86). In a commu-
nity-based study of African American and
non-Hispanic White adults without di-
abetes, baseline A1C was a stronger
predictor of subsequent diabetes and
cardiovascular events than fasting glu-
cose (87). Other analyses suggest that
A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher
is associated with a diabetes risk simi-
lar to that of the high-risk participants
in the Diabetes Prevention Program
(DPP) (88), and A1C at baseline was a
strong predictor of the development
of glucose-deﬁned diabetes during the
DPP and its follow-up (7).

An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–
47 mmol/mol) identiﬁes a group of indi-
viduals at high risk for diabetes and car-
diovascular outcomes. These individuals
should be informed of their increased
risk for diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
ease and counseled about effective strat-
egies to lower their risks (see Section 3,
“Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and
Associated Comorbidities”). Similar to glu-
cose measurements, the continuum of
risk is continuous and curvilinear: as A1C
rises, the diabetes risk rises disproportion-
ately (86). Aggressive interventions and
vigilant follow-up should be pursued for
those considered at very high risk (e.g.,
those with A1C >6.0% [>42 mmol/mol]
and individuals with both IFG and IGT).

Table 2.5 outlines the criteria for
screening for prediabetes. The ADA risk
test is an additional option (i.e., an
awareness tool for the layperson and
the health care professional) for assess-
ment to determine the appropriateness
of screening for diabetes or prediabetes
in asymptomatic adults (Fig. 2.2) (dia-
betes.org/diabetes-risk-test). For addi-
tional background regarding risk fac-
tors and screening for prediabetes, see
screening and testing for prediabetes
and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic
adults and screening and testing for
prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in chil-
dren and adolescents, below. For details
regarding individuals with prediabetes
most likely to beneﬁt from a formal be-
havioral or lifestyle intervention, see Sec-
tion 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes
and Associated Comorbidities.”

Type 2 Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all
diabetes. This form encompasses individuals

who generally have relative (rather than
absolute) insulin deﬁciency and have insu-
lin resistance (i.e., decreased biological re-
sponses to insulin).

There are various causes of type 2 dia-
betes. Although the speciﬁc etiologies
are not known, individuals do not have
any of the other known causes of diabe-
tes. Most, but not all, people with type 2
diabetes have overweight or obesity. Ex-
cess weight itself causes some degree of
insulin resistance. Individuals who do not
have obesity or overweight by traditional
weight criteria may have an increased per-
centage of body fat distributed predomi-
nantly in the abdominal region, including
sites involved in metabolic dysfunction–
associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)
and/or ectopic sites (e.g., skeletal muscle).
DKA seldom occurs spontaneously in
type 2 diabetes (30); when seen, it usually
arises in individuals who are insulinopenic
and already treated with insulin (e.g.,
missed or inadequate doses); in people
with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes; in as-
sociation with the stress of another illness
such as infection (e.g., COVID-19) or myo-
cardial infarction; in association with illicit
drug use (e.g., cocaine); in association
with certain social determinants of health;
or with the use of certain medications
such as glucocorticoids, second-generation
antipsychotics, or SGLT2 inhibitors (89,90).
HHS is more typically associated with type
2 diabetes (existing or new diagnosis) and
is characterized by severe hyperglycemia,
hyperosmolality, and dehydration in the
absence of signiﬁcant ketoacidosis. Peo-
ple with diabetes can also have mixed
clinical features of both DKA and HHS
(30).

Type 2 diabetes frequently goes un-
diagnosed for many years, because hy-
perglycemia develops gradually and, at
earlier stages, is often not severe enough
for the individual to notice the classic dia-
betes symptoms caused by hyperglyce-
mia, such as dehydration or unintentional
weight loss. Nevertheless, even undiag-
nosed people with diabetes are at in-
creased risk of developing macrovascular
and microvascular complications.

People with type 2 diabetes early in
the disease course may have insulin levels
that appear normal or elevated, yet the
failure to normalize blood glucose reﬂects
a relative defect in glucose-stimulated in-
sulin secretion that is insufﬁcient to com-
pensate for insulin resistance.
Insulin
resistance may improve with weight

reduction, physical activity, and/or pharma-
cologic treatment of hyperglycemia but is
seldom restored to normal. Recent inter-
ventions with intensive nutritional changes
and exercise, newer pharmacological agents
(e.g., GLP-1 RAs), or surgical weight loss can
lead to diabetes remission (91–94) (see
Section 8, “Obesity and Weight Manage-
ment for the Prevention and Treatment of
Type 2 Diabetes”).

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes
increases with age, obesity, and lack of
physical activity (95,96). It occurs more
frequently in individuals with prediabetes,
prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or
polycystic ovary syndrome. It is also more
common in people with hypertension or
dyslipidemia and in certain racial, ethnic,
and ancestral subgroups (Table 2.5). It is
often associated with a strong genetic
predisposition or family history in ﬁrst-
degree relatives (more so than type 1 dia-
betes). However, the genetics of type 2
diabetes are poorly understood and under
intense investigation in this era of preci-
sion medicine (50). The composition of
the gut microbiome may also affect the
likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes
(97). In adults without traditional risk fac-
tors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger
age, consider islet autoantibody testing
(e.g., GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (36) (Fig. 2.1).

Screening and Testing for
Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in
Asymptomatic Adults
Screening for prediabetes and type 2 dia-
betes risk through a targeted assessment
of risk factors (Table 2.5) or with an as-
sessment tool, such as the ADA risk test
(Fig. 2.2) (diabetes.org/diabetes-risk-test),
is recommended to guide health care
professionals on whether performing a di-
agnostic test (Table 2.1) is appropriate.
Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes meet cri-
teria for conditions in which early detec-
tion via screening is appropriate. Both
conditions are common and impose sig-
niﬁcant clinical and public health burdens.
There is often a long presymptomatic
phase before the diagnosis of type 2 dia-
betes. Simple tests to detect preclinical
disease are readily available (98). The du-
ration of glycemic burden is a strong pre-
dictor of adverse outcomes. There are
effective interventions that prevent pro-
gression from prediabetes to diabetes. It
is important to individualize the risk-to-
beneﬁt ratio of formal
intervention for

which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but 
not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Talk 
to your doctor to see if additional testing is needed. 

Type 2 diabetes is more common in African Americans, 
Hispanic/Latino individuals, Native Americans, Asian
Americans,  and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. 

Higher body weight increases diabetes risk for 
everyone. Asian Americans are at increased diabetes 
risk at lower body weight than the rest of the general 
public (about 15 pounds lower).

Foot Care”). In the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) Diabetes Prevention Program
Outcomes Study (DPPOS) report, preven-
tion of progression from prediabetes to di-
abetes (101) resulted in lower rates of
developing retinopathy and nephropathy
(102). Similar impact on diabetes com-
plications was reported with screening,
diagnosis, and comprehensive risk factor
management in the U.K. Clinical Prac-
tice Research Datalink database (100).
In that report, progression from predia-
betes to diabetes augmented risk of
complications.

Despite the numerous beneﬁts of screen-
ing and early diagnosis for prediabetes or
diabetes, unfortunately many people in
the U.S. and globally either remain un-
diagnosed or are diagnosed late, when
complications have already arisen.
Additional considerations

regarding
testing for type 2 diabetes and prediabe-
tes in asymptomatic individuals are de-
scribed below.

Age
Age is a major risk factor for diabetes.
Testing should begin at no later than age
35 years for all people (103). Screening
should be considered in adults of any age
with overweight or obesity and one or
more risk factors for diabetes.

Medications
Certain medications, such as glucocorti-
coids, statins (104), thiazide diuretics,
some HIV medications (19), and second-
generation antipsychotic medications
(105), should be considered when de-
ciding whether to screen for prediabe-
tes or diabetes, as these medications
are known to increase the risks of these
conditions.

For example, people taking second-
generation antipsychotic medications re-
quire greater monitoring because of an in-
crease in risk of type 2 diabetes associated
with this medication (105). There is a
range of effects on metabolic parame-
ters (e.g., hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia,
and weight gain) across second-generation
antipsychotic medications. People treated
with these agents should be screened for
prediabetes or diabetes at baseline, re-
screened 12–16 weeks after medication
initiation, and screened annually thereaf-
ter (105). Repeat testing can occur sooner
if clinically warranted.

People With HIV
People with HIV are at higher risk for de-
veloping prediabetes and diabetes. In ad-
dition, some antiretroviral (ARV) therapies
may further increase the risk. Therefore, a
screening protocol for prediabetes and
type 2 diabetes is recommended (106). As
the A1C test may underestimate glycemia
in people with HIV, plasma glucose criteria
are preferred to diagnose prediabetes and
diabetes (20).

Diabetes risk is increased with certain
protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside/
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NRTIs). New-onset diabetes is estimated
to occur in more than 5% of individuals
infected with HIV on PIs, whereas more
than 15% may have prediabetes (107).
PIs are associated with insulin resistance
and may also lead to apoptosis of pan-
creatic b-cells. NRTIs also affect fat distribu-
tion (both lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy),
which is associated with insulin resistance.
For people with HIV and ARV-associated
hyperglycemia, it may be appropriate
to consider discontinuing the problem-
atic ARV agents if safe and effective alter-
natives are available (108). Before making
ARV substitutions, carefully consider the
possible effect on HIV virological control
and the potential adverse effects of new
ARV agents. In some cases, antihypergly-
cemic agents may still be necessary.

Testing Interval
The appropriate interval between screen-
ing tests is not known (109). The ratio-
nale for the 3-year interval is that with
this interval, the number of false-positive
tests that require conﬁrmatory testing
will be reduced, and individuals with
false-negative tests will be retested before
substantial time elapses and complications
develop (109). In especially high-risk indi-
viduals such as those with previous val-
ues nearer to the diabetes diagnostic cut
point, shorter intervals between screen-
ings may be useful.

Community Screening
Ideally, screening should be carried out
within a health care setting (including ap-
propriately resourced pharmacies) because
of the need for follow-up and treatment.
Community screening outside a health
care setting is generally not recommended
because people with positive tests may
not seek, or have access to, appropriate

follow-up testing and care. However, in spe-
ciﬁc situations where an adequate referral
system is established beforehand for posi-
tive tests, community screening may be
considered. Community screening may also
be poorly targeted; i.e., it may fail to reach
the groups most at risk and inappropriately
test those at very low risk or even those
who have already been diagnosed (110).

Screening in Dental Practices
Because of the bidirectional relationship
between periodontal disease and diabetes,
the utility of screening in a dental setting
and referral to primary care as a means to
improve the diagnosis of prediabetes and
diabetes has been explored (111,112). For
example, one study estimated that 30% of
individuals $30 years of age seen in gen-
eral dental practices (including both peo-
ple with and without periodontal disease)
had newly diagnosed dysglycemia (112).
Further research is needed to demon-
strate the feasibility, effectiveness, and
cost-effectiveness of screening in this
setting. For additional background on
oral health in relation to prediabetes
and type 2 diabetes, see Section 4,
“Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and
Assessment of Comorbidities.”

Screening and Testing for
Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in
Children and Adolescents
The epidemiologic studies that formed
the basis for the recommendations to use
A1C and plasma glucose criteria to diag-
nose prediabetes and diabetes included
only adult populations (113). However,
ADA clinical guidance concluded that A1C,
FPG, or 2-h PG also could be used to test
for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in chil-
dren and adolescents (114).

In the last decade, the incidence and
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children
and adolescents has increased dramati-
cally, especially in certain high-risk racial,
ethnic, and ancestral subgroups (115).
See Table 2.6 for recommendations on
risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes
or prediabetes in asymptomatic children
and adolescents in a clinical setting (114).
See Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 for the cri-
teria for the diagnosis of diabetes and
prediabetes, respectively, that apply to
children, adolescents, and adults. See Sec-
tion 14, “Children and Adolescents,” for

in children and adolescents.

PANCREATIC DIABETES OR
DIABETES IN THE CONTEXT OF
DISEASE OF THE EXOCRINE
PANCREAS

Recommendation
2.17 Screen people for diabetes within
3–6 months following an episode of
acute pancreatitis and annually there-
after. Screening for diabetes is rec-
ommended annually for people with
chronic pancreatitis. E

Pancreatic diabetes (also termed pan-
creatogenic diabetes or type 3c diabetes)
includes both structural (e.g., destruction
or removal of normal pancreatic tissue)
and functional loss of glucose-normalizing
insulin secretion in the context of exo-
crine pancreatic dysfunction and is com-
monly misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.
The diverse set of etiologies includes
pancreatitis (acute and chronic pancre-
atic inﬂammation and associated ﬁbrosis
leading to loss of functional exocrine and
endocrine pancreatic function), trauma
or pancreatectomy, neoplasia, cystic ﬁbrosis
(addressed later in this section), hemochro-
matosis, ﬁbrocalculous pancreatopathy,
rare genetic disorders, and idiopathic forms
(2); as such, pancreatic diabetes is the pre-
ferred umbrella term (116).

Acute (even a single bout) and chronic
pancreatitis can lead to postpancreatitis
diabetes mellitus (117). A distinguishing
feature is concurrent pancreatic exocrine
insufﬁciency (consider screening individ-
uals with acute and chronic pancreatitis
for exocrine pancreatic insufﬁciency by
measuring fecal elastase), pathological
pancreatic imaging (endoscopic ultra-
sound, MRI, and computed tomography),
and absence of type 1 diabetes–associated
autoimmunity (118–122). There is loss of
both insulin and glucagon secretion and
often higher-than-expected insulin re-
quirements. Risk for microvascular com-
plications appears to be similar to that
of other forms of diabetes.

For people with pancreatitis and diabe-
tes, therapy should be advanced if A1C
goals are not met. Glucose-lowering
therapies potentially associated with
increased risk of pancreatitis (i.e., incretin-
based therapies) should be avoided. Early
insulin therapy should be
initiation of

considered. In the context of pancreatec-
tomy,
islet autotransplantation can be
considered for selected individuals with
medically refractory chronic pancreatitis in
specialized centers to preserve endoge-
nous islet function and insulin secretion
(123,124). In some cases, autotransplant
can lead to insulin independence. In
others, it may decrease insulin require-
ments (125).

Cystic Fibrosis–Related Diabetes

Recommendations
2.18 Annual screening for cystic ﬁ-
brosis–related diabetes (CFRD) with
an OGTT should begin by age 10 years
in all people with cystic ﬁbrosis not
previously diagnosed with CFRD. B
2.19 A1C is not recommended as a
screening test for CFRD due to low
sensitivity. However, a value of $6.5%
($48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a
diagnosis of CFRD. B
2.20 Beginning 5 years after the di-
agnosis of CFRD, annual monitoring
for complications of diabetes is rec-
ommended. E

Cystic ﬁbrosis is a multisystem condition
arising from recessive mutations in the
gene encoding the cystic ﬁbrosis trans-
membrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
protein. Pancreatic exocrine damage,
which can begin as early as infancy, ulti-
mately leads to pancreatic exocrine insuf-
ﬁciency (126). Cystic ﬁbrosis–related
diabetes (CFRD) is a common comorbid-
ity in people with cystic ﬁbrosis, occur-
ring in about 20% of adolescents and
40–50% of adults (127). The relevance of
CFRD is highlighted by its association
with increased morbidity, mortality, and
patient burden. Diabetes in this popula-
tion, compared with individuals with
type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is associated
with worse nutritional status, more se-
vere inﬂammatory lung disease, and
greater mortality. Insulin insufﬁciency is
the primary defect in CFRD. Genetically
determined b-cell function and insulin
resistance associated with infection and
inﬂammation may also contribute to
the development of CFRD.

Milder abnormalities of glucose toler-
ance are even more common and occur
at earlier ages than CFRD. Whether indi-
viduals with IGT should be treated with
insulin replacement has not currently
been determined. Although screening for

diabetes before the age of 10 years can
identify risk for progression to CFRD in
those with abnormal glucose tolerance,
no beneﬁt has been established with
respect to weight, height, BMI, or lung
function. OGTT is the recommended
screening test for CFRD. Not unexpect-
edly, annual OGTTs are perceived as bur-
densome, and engagement in current
CFRD screening guidelines is poor, with
only 30% of adults with cystic ﬁbrosis
having annual OGTTs (128). A1C is not
recommended for screening due to low
sensitivity; however, a value of $6.5%
($48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a
diagnosis of CFRD and reduces patient
screening burden (129–131). Regardless
of age, weight loss or failure of expected
weight gain is a risk for CFRD and should
prompt screening (129,130). The Cystic
Fibrosis
Foundation Patient Registry
(132) evaluated 3,553 people with cystic
ﬁbrosis and identiﬁed 445 (13%) with
CFRD. Early diagnosis and treatment of
CFRD was associated with preservation
of lung function. The European Cystic Fi-
brosis Society Patient Registry reported
an increase in CFRD with age (10% in-
crease per decade), genotype, decreased
lung function, and female sex (133). CGM
or HOMA of b-cell function (134) may be
more sensitive than OGTT to detect risk
for progression to CFRD; however, evi-
dence linking these results to long-term
outcomes is lacking, and these tests are
not recommended for screening outside
the research setting (127). There is inade-
quate evidence presently to alter CFRD
screening based on use of highly effec-
tive CFTR modulator therapy, which uses
small-molecule compounds that directly
correct the basic defect of the CFTR chan-
nel and restore channel function (127).

CFRD mortality has signiﬁcantly de-
creased over time, and the gap in mortal-
ity between people with cystic ﬁbrosis
with and without diabetes has consider-
ably narrowed (135). There are limited
clinical trial data on optimal therapy for
CFRD. People with CFRD should be treated
with insulin to attain individualized glyce-
mic goals. See Section 9, “Pharmacologic
Approaches to Glycemic Treatment,” for
further information.

Additional resources for the clinical man-
agement of CFRD can be found in the posi-
tion statement “Clinical Care Guidelines for
Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes” (136) and
in the International Society for Pediatric

and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) 2022 clin-
ical practice consensus guidelines (127).

POSTTRANSPLANTATION
DIABETES MELLITUS

Recommendations
2.21 After organ transplantation,
screening for hyperglycemia should be
done. A formal diagnosis of posttrans-
plantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is
best made once the individual is stable
on an immunosuppressive plan and in
the absence of an acute infection. B
2.22 The OGTT is the preferred test
to make a diagnosis of PTDM. B
2.23 Immunosuppressive plans shown
to provide the best outcomes for indi-
viduals and graft survival should be
used, irrespective of PTDM risk. E

Several terms are used in the literature
to describe the presence of diabetes
following organ transplantation (137).
New-onset diabetes after transplanta-
tion (NODAT) is one such designation
that describes individuals who develop
new-onset diabetes following transplant.
NODAT excludes people with pretrans-
plant diabetes that was undiagnosed as
well as posttransplant hyperglycemia that
resolves by the time of discharge (138).
Another term, posttransplantation diabe-
tes mellitus (PTDM) (138,139), describes
the presence of diabetes in the post-
transplant setting irrespective of the
timing of diabetes onset (140). The clini-
cal importance of PTDM lies in its impact
as a signiﬁcant risk factor for cardiovas-
cular disease and chronic kidney disease
in solid-organ transplantation (137).

Hyperglycemia is very common during
the early posttransplant period, with (cid:1)90%
of kidney allograft recipients exhibiting
hyperglycemia in the ﬁrst few weeks
following transplant (138,139,141,142).
In most cases, such stress- or steroid-
induced hyperglycemia resolves by the
time of discharge (142,143). Although
the use of immunosuppressive thera-
pies is a major contributor to the devel-
opment of PTDM, the risks of transplant
rejection outweigh the risks of PTDM,
and the role of the diabetes health care
is to treat hyperglycemia
professional
appropriately regardless of the type of
immunosuppression (138). Risk factors for
PTDM include both general diabetes

risks (such as age, family history of diabe-
tes, and obesity) and transplant-speciﬁc
factors, such as use of immunosuppres-
sant agents (144–146). Whereas post-
transplantation hyperglycemia is an
important risk factor for subsequent
PTDM, a formal diagnosis of PTDM is
optimally made once the individual is stable
on maintenance immunosuppression (usu-
ally at least 45 days) and in the absence of
acute infection (138,142–144,147).

The OGTT is recommended for the di-
agnosis of PTDM (1 year posttransplant)
(138,139,148). However, screening people
with FPG and/or A1C can identify high-risk
individuals who require further assess-
ment and may reduce the number of
overall OGTTs required.

Few randomized controlled studies have
reported on the short- and long-term use
of antihyperglycemic agents in the setting
of PTDM (144,149,150). Most studies have
reported that transplant individuals with
hyperglycemia and PTDM after transplan-
tation have higher rates of rejection, infec-
tion, and rehospitalization (142,144,151).
Insulin therapy is the agent of choice for
the management of hyperglycemia and
diabetes in the hospital setting and can
be continued postdischarge. Noninsulin
glucose-lowering therapies can also be
used for long-term management. The
choice of agent is usually made based
on the side effect proﬁle of the medica-
tion, possible interactions with the indi-
vidual’s immunosuppression plan, and
potential cardiovascular and renal ben-
eﬁts in individuals with PTDM (144).
See Section 9, “Pharmacologic Approaches
to Glycemic Treatment,” for
further
information.

MONOGENIC DIABETES
SYNDROMES

Recommendations
2.24a Regardless of current age, all
people diagnosed with diabetes in the
ﬁrst 6 months of life should have ge-
netic testing for neonatal diabetes. B
2.24b Children and young adults who
do not have typical characteristics of
type 1 or type 2 diabetes and family
history of diabetes in successive gen-
erations (suggestive of an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance) should
have genetic testing for maturity-
onset diabetes of the young (MODY). B
2.24c In both instances, consultation
with a center specializing in diabetes

genetics is recommended to under-
stand the signiﬁcance of genetic mu-
tations and how best to approach
further evaluation, treatment, and
genetic counseling. E

Monogenic defects that cause b-cell dys-
function (e.g., neonatal diabetes and
MODY) or insulin resistance syndromes
(e.g., monogenic lipodystrophies) are pre-
sent in a small fraction of people with dia-
betes (<5%) (152). Table 2.7 describes
the most common causes of monogenic
diabetes. For a comprehensive list of
causes, see Genetic Diagnosis of Endo-
crine Disorders (153) and ISPAD 2022 clin-
ical practice consensus guidelines (152).

Diagnosis of Monogenic Diabetes
The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes
should be considered in children and adults
diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood
with the following ﬁndings:

(cid:129) Diabetes diagnosed within the ﬁrst 6

months of life (152,154)

(cid:129) Diabetes without typical features of
type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative
diabetes-associated autoantibodies,
no obesity, and lacking other metabolic
features, especially strong family his-
tory of diabetes)

(cid:129) Stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia
(100–150 mg/dL [5.6–8.5 mmol/L]),
stable A1C between 5.6% and 7.6%
(between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), es-
pecially if no obesity

Neonatal Diabetes
Diabetes occurring under 6 months of
age is termed neonatal diabetes, and
about 80–85% of cases can be found to
have an underlying monogenic cause
(36,154–157). Neonatal diabetes occurs
much less often after 6 months of age,
whereas autoimmune type 1 diabetes
rarely occurs before 6 months of age.
Neonatal diabetes can either be transient
or permanent. Transient diabetes is most
often due to overexpression of genes on
chromosome 6q24, is recurrent in about
half of cases, and may be treatable with
medications other than insulin. Perma-
nent neonatal diabetes is most commonly
due to autosomal dominant mutations in
the genes encoding the Kir6.2 subunit
(KCNJ11) and SUR1 subunit (ABCC8) of the
b-cell KATP channel.

The ADA-European Association for the
Study of Diabetes type 1 diabetes consen-
sus report recommends that regardless of
current age, individuals diagnosed under
6 months of age should have genetic test-
ing (36). Correct diagnosis has critical im-
plications, because 30–50% of people with
KATP-related neonatal diabetes will exhibit
improved blood glucose levels when
treated with high-dose oral sulfonylureas
instead of insulin. Insulin gene (INS) mu-
tations are the second most common
cause of permanent neonatal diabetes,
with insulin therapy being the preferred
treatment strategy.

Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the
Young
MODY is frequently characterized by on-
set of hyperglycemia at an early age (clas-
sically before age 25 years, although
diagnosis may occur at older ages). MODY
is characterized by impaired insulin secre-
tion with minimal or no defects in insulin

action (in the absence of coexistent obe-
sity). It is inherited in an autosomal domi-
nant pattern with abnormalities in at least
14 genes on different chromosomes iden-
tiﬁed to date (152). The most commonly
reported forms are GCK-MODY (MODY2),
HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), and HNF4A-
MODY (MODY1).

Correct diagnosis of monogenic forms
of diabetes is critical because people
who have them may be incorrectly diag-
nosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes,
leading to suboptimal, even potentially
harmful, treatment plans and delays in
diagnosing other family members (152).
A diagnosis of MODY should be consid-
ered in individuals who have atypical dia-
betes and multiple family members with
diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or
type 2 diabetes (155–162) (Fig. 2.1). In
most cases, the presence of autoantibod-
ies for type 1 diabetes precludes further
testing for monogenic diabetes, but the
presence of autoantibodies in people with

monogenic diabetes has been reported.
Individuals in whom monogenic diabetes
is suspected should have genetic testing.
Genetic screening (i.e., next-generation
sequencing) is increasingly available and
cost-effective (152). Consultation with a
center specializing in diabetes genetics is
recommended to understand the signiﬁ-
cance of genetic mutations and how best
to approach further evaluation, treatment,
and genetic counseling. Genetic counsel-
ing is recommended to ensure that af-
fected individuals understand the patterns
of inheritance and the importance of a
correct diagnosis and to address compre-
hensive cardiovascular risk.

A diagnosis of one of the three most
common forms of MODY, HNF1A-MODY,
GCK-MODY, and HNF4A-MODY, allows for
more cost-effective personalized therapy
(i.e., no therapy for GCK-MODY and sulfo-
nylureas as ﬁrst-line therapy for HNF1A-
MODY and HNF4A-MODY). See Section 9,
“Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic

GESTATIONAL DIABETES
MELLITUS

Recommendations
2.25 In individuals who are planning
pregnancy, screen those with risk fac-
tors (Table 2.5) B and consider testing
all individuals of childbearing potential
for undiagnosed prediabetes or diabe-
tes. E
2.26a Before 15 weeks of gesta-
tion, test individuals with risk fac-
tors (Table 2.5) B and consider testing
all individuals E for undiagnosed diabe-
tes at the ﬁrst prenatal visit using stan-
dard diagnostic criteria if not screened
preconception.
2.26b Before 15 weeks of gestation,
screen for abnormal glucose metabo-
lism to identify individuals who are at
higher risk of adverse pregnancy and
neonatal outcomes, are more likely
to need insulin, and are at high risk
of a later gestational diabetes melli-
tus (GDM) diagnosis. B
2.26c Screen for early abnormal glu-
cose metabolism with dysglycemia
using FPG 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–
6.9 mmol/L) or A1C 5.9–6.4% (41–
47 mmol/mol). B
2.27 Screen for GDM at 24–28 weeks
of gestation in pregnant individuals
not previously found to have diabe-
tes or high-risk abnormal glucose me-
tabolism detected earlier in the current
pregnancy. A
2.28 Screen individuals with GDM for
prediabetes or diabetes at 4–12 weeks
postpartum, using the 75-g OGTT and
clinically appropriate nonpregnancy di-
agnostic criteria. B
2.29 Individuals with a history of GDM
should have lifelong screening for the
development of prediabetes or diabe-
tes every 1–3 years. B

Deﬁnition
For many years, gestational diabetes mel-
litus (GDM) was deﬁned as any degree of
glucose intolerance that was ﬁrst recog-
nized during pregnancy (86), regardless
of the degree of hyperglycemia. This

deﬁnition facilitated a uniform strategy
for detection and classiﬁcation of GDM,
but this deﬁnition has limitations (163).
First, the best evidence reveals that
many cases of GDM represent preexist-
ing hyperglycemia that is detected by
routine screening in pregnancy, as rou-
tine screening is not widely performed in
nonpregnant individuals of reproductive
age. The ongoing epidemic of obesity
and diabetes has led to more type 2 dia-
betes in people of reproductive age, with
an increase in the number of pregnant indi-
viduals with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes
in early pregnancy (164–166). Ideally, un-
diagnosed diabetes should be identiﬁed
preconception in individuals with risk fac-
tors or in high-risk populations (167–172),
as they are likely to beneﬁt from precon-
ception care. The preconception care of
people with known preexisting diabetes
results in lower A1C and reduced risk of
birth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal
mortality, small-for-gestational-age birth
weight, and neonatal intensive care unit
admission (173).
If individuals are not
screened prior to pregnancy, universal
early screening at <15 weeks of gestation
for undiagnosed diabetes may be consid-
ered over selective screening (Table 2.5),
particularly in populations with high prev-
alence of risk factors and undiagnosed di-
abetes in people of childbearing age.
Strong racial and ethnic disparities exist in
the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes.
Therefore, early screening provides an ini-
tial step to identify these health dispar-
ities so that they can begin to address
them (169–172). Diagnostic criteria for
identifying undiagnosed diabetes in early
pregnancy are the same as those used in
nonpregnant individuals (Table 2.1). In-
dividuals found to have diabetes should
be classiﬁed as having diabetes compli-
cating pregnancy (most often type 2 dia-
betes, rarely type 1 diabetes or monogenic
diabetes) and managed accordingly.

Early abnormal glucose metabolism,
deﬁned as a fasting glucose threshold of
110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) or an A1C of
5.9% (41 mmol/mol), may identify indi-
viduals who are at higher risk of adverse
pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (pre-
eclampsia, macrosomia, shoulder dysto-
cia, and perinatal death), are at high risk
of a later GDM diagnosis, and are more
likely to need insulin treatment (174–176).
An A1C threshold of 5.7% (39 mmol/L) has
not been shown to be associated with ad-
verse perinatal outcomes (177,178).

If early screenings for undiagnosed dia-
betes or early abnormal glucose metabo-
lism were negative, individuals should be
rescreened for GDM between 24 and 28
weeks of gestation and individuals not
previously screened should be screened
for GDM at the same time point (see
Section 15, “Management of Diabetes in
Pregnancy”). The GDM diagnostic criteria
for the 75-g OGTT from the International
Association of the Diabetes and Preg-
nancy Study Groups (IADPSG) and the
GDM screening and diagnostic criteria
with the two-step approach were not
derived from data in the ﬁrst half of
pregnancy and should not be used for
early screening (179). Most randomized
controlled trials of treatment of early ab-
normal glucose metabolism have been
underpowered for outcomes. One random-
ized controlled trial performed at 17 centers
administered early screening (mean 15.6 ±
2.5 weeks) for GDM with a 75-g OGTT. Indi-
viduals who met World Health Organization
criteria for GDM were randomized to re-
ceive early treatment or a repeat OGTT at
24–28 weeks (with deferred treatment if in-
dicated). The ﬁrst primary outcome mea-
sure was an adverse neonatal composite
outcome including birth <37 weeks, birth
weight $4.5 kg, birth trauma, neonatal
respiratory distress within 24 h of birth,
phototherapy, stillbirth neonatal death,
or shoulder dystocia. Early GDM treat-
ment resulted in a modest improvement
in the composite adverse neonatal out-
come (24.9% early treatment vs. 30.5%
control
relative risk 0.82
[0.68–0.98]), although this was driven pri-
marily by differences in rates of neonatal
respiratory distress between groups that
included neonates requiring $4 h of sup-
plemental oxygen who may not have re-
quired a higher level of respiratory care.
There was also a suggestion of more ben-
eﬁt (per prespeciﬁed subgroup analyses)
among individuals who had the OGTT at
<14 weeks and among those with OGTT
glycemic values in higher ranges (180).
Therefore, the beneﬁts of treatment of
early abnormal glucose metabolism re-
main uncertain. Nutrition counseling and
periodic testing of glucose levels weekly
to identify individuals with high glucose
levels are suggested. Testing frequency
may proceed to daily, and treatment may
be intensiﬁed, if the FPG is predominantly
>110 mg/dL (>6.1 mmol/L) prior to
18 weeks of gestation.

Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes

S43

Both the FPG and A1C are low-cost
tests. An advantage of the A1C test is its
convenience, as it can be added to the
prenatal
laboratories and does not re-
quire an early-morning fasting appoint-
ment. Disadvantages include inaccuracies
in the presence of increased red blood
cell turnover and hemoglobinopathies
(usually reads lower) and higher values
with anemia and reduced red blood cell
turnover (181). A1C is not reliable for
screening for GDM or for preexisting di-
abetes at 15 weeks of gestation or later
in part from the higher red blood cell
turnover in pregnancy but also from
the unknown diabetes status prior to
pregnancy, which could help distin-
guish new-onset diabetes from preex-
isting diabetes.

GDM is often indicative of underlying
b-cell dysfunction (182), which confers
marked increased risk for later develop-
ment of glucose intolerance and diabetes
in the mother after delivery (183–185).
As effective prevention interventions are
available (186,187), individuals diagnosed
with GDM should receive lifelong screen-
ing for prediabetes to allow interventions
to reduce diabetes risk and for type 2 dia-
betes to allow treatment at the earliest
possible time (188).

Diagnosis
GDM carries risks for the mother, fetus,
and neonate. The Hyperglycemia and Ad-
verse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study
(189), a large-scale multinational cohort
study completed by more than 23,000
pregnant individuals, demonstrated that
risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neo-
natal outcomes continuously increased
as a function of maternal glycemia at
24–28 weeks of gestation, even within
ranges previously considered normal for
pregnancy. For most complications, there
was no threshold for risk. These results
have led to careful reconsideration of the
diagnostic criteria for GDM.

GDM diagnosis (Table 2.8) can be ac-
complished with either of two strategies:

1. The “one-step” 75-g OGTT derived

from the IADPSG criteria, or

2. The older “two-step” approach with a
50-g (nonfasting) screen followed by a
100-g OGTT for those who screen posi-
tive based on the work of Carpenter-
Coustan’s interpretation of the older
O’Sullivan and Mahan (190) criteria.

Table 2.8—Screening for and diagnosis of GDM

One-step strategy
Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at
1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.

The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h.
The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or

exceeded:

(cid:3) Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)
(cid:3) 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
(cid:3) 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)

Two-step strategy
Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at
24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.

If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is $130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2,

7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT.

Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting.
The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose
levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded
(Carpenter-Coustan criteria [208]):

(cid:3) Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)
(cid:3) 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
(cid:3) 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)
(cid:3) 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)

GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; GLT, glucose load test; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance
test. *American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the
commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (204). †ACOG
notes that one elevated value can be used for diagnosis (204).

Different diagnostic criteria will
identify
different degrees of maternal hypergly-
leading
cemia and maternal/fetal risk,
experts to debate optimal strategies for
the diagnosis of GDM.

One-Step Strategy
The IADPSG examined data from the
HAPO study and deﬁned diagnostic cut
points for GDM as the average fasting,
1-h, and 2-h PG values during a 75-g
OGTT in individuals at 24–28 weeks of
gestation, wherein the cut points were
those at which odds for adverse outcomes
reached 1.75 times the estimated odds.
This one-step strategy was anticipated to
signiﬁcantly increase the incidence of
GDM (from 5–6% to 15–20%), primarily
because only one abnormal value, not
two, became sufﬁcient to make the diag-
nosis (191). Many regional studies have
seen a roughly one- to threefold increase
in GDM cases using the IADPSG criteria
(192). A study of pregnancy OGTTs with
glucose levels blinded to caregivers found
that 11 years after their pregnancies, in-
dividuals who would have been diagnosed
with GDM by the one-step approach, as
compared with those without GDM, were
at 3.4-fold higher risk of developing pre-
diabetes and type 2 diabetes and had
children with a higher risk of obesity and

increased body fat, suggesting that the
group identiﬁed as having GDM by the
one-step approach would beneﬁt from
the increased screening for diabetes and
prediabetes after pregnancy (193). The
ADA recommends the IADPSG diagnostic
criteria to optimize gestational outcomes,
because these criteria are the only ones
based on pregnancy outcomes rather
than end points such as prediction of
subsequent maternal diabetes.

Expected beneﬁts of using IADPSG
criteria for offspring are inferred from in-
tervention trials focusing on individuals
with lower levels of hyperglycemia than
those identiﬁed using older GDM diag-
nostic criteria. Those trials found modest
beneﬁts, including reduced rates of large-
for-gestational-age births and preeclamp-
sia (194,195). Of note, 80–90% of partici-
pants being treated for mild GDM in
these two randomized controlled trials
could be managed with lifestyle therapy
alone. The OGTT glucose cutoffs in these
two trials overlapped the thresholds rec-
ommended by the IADPSG, and in one trial
(195), the 2-h PG threshold (140 mg/dL
[7.8 mmol/L]) was lower than the cutoff
recommended by the IADPSG (153 mg/dL
[8.5 mmol/L]).

No randomized controlled trials of treat-
ing versus not treating GDM diagnosed by

Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

different criteria have been published to
date. However, a randomized trial of test-
ing for GDM at 24–28 weeks of gestation
by the one-step method using IADPSG
criteria versus the two-step method by
Carpenter-Coustan criteria identiﬁed twice
as many individuals with GDM using the
one-step method. Despite treating more
individuals for GDM using the one-step
method, there was no difference in
pregnancy and perinatal complications
(196), though concerns were raised about
sample size estimates and unanticipated
suboptimal engagement with the screen-
ing and treatment protocol. For example,
in the two-step group, 165 participants
not counted as having GDM were treated
for isolated elevated FPG >95 mg/dL
(>5.3 mmol/L) (197).

The one-step method identiﬁes long-
term risks of maternal prediabetes and di-
abetes as well as offspring glucose intol-
erance and adiposity. Post hoc GDM in
individuals diagnosed with this method in
the HAPO cohort was associated with
higher prevalence of IGT; higher 30-min,
1-h, and 2-h glucose levels during the
OGTT; and reduced insulin sensitivity and
oral disposition index in their offspring at
10–14 years of age compared with off-
spring of mothers without GDM. Associa-
tions of mother’s fasting, 1-h, and 2-h
values on the 75-g OGTT were continuous
with a comprehensive panel of offspring
metabolic outcomes (198,199). HAPO
Follow-up Study (HAPO FUS) data demon-
strate that neonatal adiposity and fetal
hyperinsulinemia (cord C-peptide), both
higher across the continuum of maternal
hyperglycemia, are mediators of child-
hood body fat (200).

Data are lacking on how the treatment
of mother’s hyperglycemia in pregnancy
affects her offspring’s risk for obesity,
diabetes, and other metabolic disorders
(201,202). Additional well-designed clini-
cal studies are needed to determine the
optimal intensity of monitoring and treat-
ment of individuals with GDM diagnosed
by the one-step strategy.

Two-Step Strategy
In 2013, the NIH convened a consensus
development conference to consider diag-
nostic criteria for diagnosing GDM (203).
The 15-member panel had representatives
from obstetrics and gynecology, mater-
nal-fetal medicine, pediatrics, diabetes
research, biostatistics, and other related
ﬁelds. The panel recommended continuing

a two-step approach to screening that
used a 1-h 50-g glucose loading test (GLT)
followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT for those
who screened positive. The American Col-
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(ACOG) recommends any of the com-
monly used thresholds of 130, 135, or
140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (204). A
2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
systematic review concluded that one-
step versus two-step screening is associ-
ated with increased likelihood of GDM
(11.5% vs. 4.9%) but without improved
health outcomes (205). The use of A1C at
24–28 weeks of gestation as a screening
test for GDM does not function as well as
the GLT (206).

Importantly, the NIH panel noted the
lack of clinical trial data demonstrating
the beneﬁts of the one-step strategy and
the potential negative consequences of
identifying a large group of individuals
with GDM,
including medicalization of
pregnancy with increased health care uti-
lization and costs. Moreover, screening
with a 50-g GLT does not require fasting
and therefore is easier to accomplish for
many individuals. Treatment of higher-
threshold maternal hyperglycemia, as iden-
tiﬁed by the two-step approach, reduces
rates of neonatal macrosomia, large-for-
gestational-age births (207), and shoulder
dystocia without increasing small-for-
gestational-age births. ACOG currently
supports the two-step approach but
notes that one elevated value, as op-
posed to two, may be used for the diag-
nosis of GDM (204). If this approach is
implemented, the incidence of GDM
will likely increase markedly. ACOG rec-
ommends either of two sets of diagnos-
tic thresholds for the 3-h 100-g OGTT
Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes
Data Group (208,209). Each is based on
different mathematical conversions of
the original recommended thresholds by
O’Sullivan and Mahan (190), which used
whole blood and nonenzymatic methods
for glucose determination. A secondary
analysis of data from a randomized clinical
trial of identiﬁcation and treatment of mild
GDM (210) demonstrated that treatment
was similarly beneﬁcial in people meeting
only the lower thresholds per Carpenter-
Coustan (208) and in those meeting only
the higher thresholds per National Diabetes
Data Group (209). If the two-step ap-
proach is used, it would appear advan-
tageous to use the Carpenter-Coustan

lower diagnostic thresholds, as shown
in step 2 in Table 2.8.

Future Considerations
Data exist to support each strategy, as
demonstrated by conﬂicting recommen-
dations by expert groups. A systematic re-
view of economic evaluations of GDM
screening found that the one-step method
identiﬁed more cases of GDM and was
more likely to be cost-effective than the
two-step method (211). The decision of
which strategy to implement must there-
fore be made based on the relative val-
ues placed on factors that have yet to
be measured (e.g., willingness to change
practice based on correlation studies
rather than intervention trial results,
available infrastructure, and importance
of cost considerations).

The IADPSG criteria (one-step strategy)
have been adopted internationally as the
preferred approach. Data that compare
population-wide outcomes with one-step
versus two-step approaches have been
inconsistent to date (196,212–214). Preg-
nancies complicated by GDM per the
IADPSG criteria, but not recognized as
such, have outcomes comparable to preg-
nancies with diagnosed GDM by the more
stringent two-step criteria (215,216). There
remains strong consensus that establishing
a uniform approach to diagnosing GDM
will beneﬁt people with GDM, caregivers,
and policymakers. Longer-term outcome
studies are currently underway.
