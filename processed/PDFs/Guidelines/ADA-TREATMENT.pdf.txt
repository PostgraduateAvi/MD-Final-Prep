The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes
the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the
components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to
evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an
interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of
Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA
standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for ADA’s
clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Committee
members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish to com-
ment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes.org/SOC.

Diabetes technology is the term used to describe the hardware, devices, and soft-
ware that people with diabetes use to assist with self-management, ranging from
lifestyle modiﬁcations to glucose monitoring and therapy adjustments. Historically, di-
abetes technology has been divided into two main categories: insulin administered
by syringe, pen, patch devices, or pump (also called continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusion) and glucose as assessed by blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM). Diabetes technology now includes automated insulin de-
livery (AID) systems that use CGM-informed algorithms to modulate insulin delivery.
It also encompasses connected insulin pens and diabetes self-management support
software that serve as medical devices. Diabetes technology, coupled with education,
follow-up, pharmacotherapy if needed, and support, can improve the lives and
health of people with diabetes; however, the complexity and rapid evolution of the
diabetes technology landscape can also be a barrier to implementation for people
with diabetes, their care partners, and the health care team.

GENERAL DEVICE PRINCIPLES

Recommendations
7.1 Diabetes devices should be offered to people with diabetes. A
7.2 Initiation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) should be offered to
people with type 1 diabetes early in the disease, even at time of diagnosis. A
7.3 The type(s) and selection of devices should be individualized based on a
person’s speciﬁc needs, circumstances, preferences, and skill level. In the setting
of an individual whose diabetes is partially or wholly managed by someone else
(e.g., a young child or a person with cognitive impairment or dexterity, psychoso-
cial issues, and/or physical limitations), the caregiver’s skills and preferences are
integral to the decision-making process. E
7.4 When prescribing a device, ensure that people with diabetes and caregivers
receive initial and ongoing education and training, either in person or remotely,
and ongoing evaluation of technique, results, and the ability to utilize data, includ-
ing uploading or sharing data (if applicable), to monitor and adjust therapy. C

7.5 Health care professionals work-
ing with diabetes technology should en-
sure that competencies are established
within the health care team based on
their speciﬁc roles and within speciﬁc
settings. E
7.6 People with diabetes who have
been using CGM, continuous subcu-
taneous insulin infusion (CSII), and/or
automated insulin delivery (AID) for di-
abetes management should have con-
tinued access across third-party payors,
regardless of age or A1C levels. E
7.7 Students should be supported at
school in the use of diabetes technol-
ogy, such as CGM systems, CSII, con-
nected insulin pens, and AID systems,
as recommended or prescribed by their
health care team. E
7.8 Recommend early initiation, includ-
ing at diagnosis, of CGM, CSII, and AID
depending on a person’s or caregiver’s
needs and preferences. C
7.9 Standardized reports for all CGM,
CSII, AID, and connected insulin devices
with a minimum of a single-page re-
port, such as the ambulatory glucose
proﬁle and weekly summary, should be
available and utilized. Options for daily
and weekly reports and raw data
should be available. E

Technology is rapidly changing, but there
is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to technol-
ogy use in people with diabetes. Insurance
coverage can lag behind device availability,
people’s interest in devices and willingness
for adoption can vary, and health care teams
may have challenges in keeping up with
newly released technology. An American
Diabetes Association resource, which can
be accessed at diabetes.org/living-with-
diabetes/treatment-care/diabetes-technology-
guide, can help health care professionals
and people with diabetes make decisions
on the initial choice of device(s). Other
sources, including health care professio-
nals and device manufacturers, can help
people troubleshoot when difﬁculties arise
(1–10).

Education and Training
In general, no device used in diabetes man-
agement works optimally without educa-
tion, training, and ongoing support. There
are multiple resources, including online tu-
torials and training videos as well as written
material, on the use of devices. People with
diabetes vary in comfort level with technol-
ogy, and some prefer in-person training
and support. Those with more education

regarding device use have better outcomes
(1,2); therefore, the need for additional ed-
ucation should be periodically assessed,
particularly if outcomes are not being met.
Better outcomes cannot be achieved, how-
ever, without the training and education of
health care professionals. The assessment
of competencies in diabetes technology is
crucial for prescribers, certiﬁed diabetes and
education specialists, pharmacists, nurses,
and anyone involved in the care of people
with diabetes. These competencies are de-
scribed as basic, fundamental, intermediate,
and advanced and are speciﬁc to the role of
each health care team member (11). In ad-
dition, the health care team’s knowledge
and competency are even more relevant
when people with diabetes are started on
advanced diabetes technologies, such as
AID systems. In such situations, training is vi-
tal and should include a discussion about re-
alistic expectations for the ability of the
initiated system to achieve glucose goals,
the system’s features and limitations, and
the best way to use the new system to maxi-
mize the beneﬁts it can offer (12).

Use in Schools
Instructions for device use should be out-
lined in the student’s diabetes medical
management plan (DMMP). A backup plan
should be included in the DMMP for poten-
tial device failure (e.g., BGM, CGM, and/or
insulin delivery devices). School nurses and
designees should complete training to stay
up to date on diabetes technologies pre-
scribed for use in the school setting. Up-
dated resources to support diabetes care at
school, including training materials and a
DMMP template, can be found online at
diabetes.org/safe-at-school-state-laws.

Initiation of Device Use
The use of CGM and BGM devices should
be considered from the outset of the diag-
nosis of diabetes that requires insulin man-
agement (3,4). CGM use allows for close
tracking of glucose levels with adjustments
of insulin dosing and lifestyle modiﬁcations
and removes the burden of frequent BGM.
In addition, early CGM initiation after diag-
nosis of type 1 diabetes in youth has been
shown to decrease A1C levels and is asso-
ciated with high parental satisfaction and
reliance on this technology for diabetes
management (5,6). Training on alarm/alert
settings when initiating CGM is crucial to
avoid alarm overload. Early initiation of
AID systems or insulin pumps should be

considered, especially in youth. In an open-
label, multicenter, randomized, parallel clinical
trial enrolling youth with newly diagnosed
type 1 diabetes, initiation of an AID system
within 21 days from diagnosis showed 10%
higher time in range (TIR) (70–180 mg/dL
[3.9–10.0 mmol/L]) and lower A1C at 12
months versus usual care (13). In addition,
use of diabetes technology overall improves
A1C and increases the number of people
achieving an A1C <7% (14). Interruption of
access to CGM is associated with a worsen-
ing of outcomes (7,15); therefore, it is im-
portant for individuals on CGM to have
consistent access to devices.

BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING

Recommendations
7.10 People with diabetes should
be provided with blood glucose monitor-
ing (BGM) devices as indicated by their
circumstances, preferences, and treat-
ment. People using CGM devices must
also have access to BGM at all times. A
7.11 People who are taking insulin
and using BGM should be encouraged
to check their blood glucose levels
when appropriate based on their insulin
therapy. This may include checking
when fasting, prior to meals and snacks,
after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of
the night, prior to, during, and after ex-
ercise, when hypoglycemia is suspected,
after treating low blood glucose levels
until they are normoglycemic, when hy-
perglycemia is suspected, and prior to
and while performing critical tasks such
as driving. B
7.12 Health care professionals should
be aware of the differences in accuracy
among blood glucose meters. Only me-
ters approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (or comparable
regulatory agencies for other geograph-
ical locations) with proven accuracy
should be used, with unexpired test
strips purchased from a pharmacy or li-
censed distributor and properly stored. E
7.13 Although BGM in people on
noninsulin therapies has not consis-
tently shown clinically signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in A1C levels, it may be helpful
when modifying meal plans, physical ac-
tivity plans, and/or medications (par-
ticularly medications that can cause
hypoglycemia) in conjunction with a
treatment adjustment program. E
7.14 Consider potential interference of
medications and substances on glucose

levels measured by blood glucose me-
ters. B

Major clinical trials of insulin-treated people
with diabetes have included BGM as part of
multifactorial
interventions to demon-
strate the beneﬁt of intensive glycemic
management on diabetes complications
(16). BGM is thus an integral component
of effective therapy for individuals using
insulin. In recent years, CGM has emerged
as a method for the assessment of glucose
levels (discussed below). Glucose monitor-
ing allows people with diabetes to evalu-
ate their individual responses to therapy
and assess whether glycemic goals are be-
ing safely achieved. Integrating results into
diabetes management can be a useful tool
for guiding medical nutrition therapy and
physical activity, preventing hypoglycemia,
or adjusting medications (particularly pran-
dial insulin doses or correction bolus doses).
The speciﬁc needs and goals of the person
with diabetes should dictate BGM fre-
quency and timing or the consideration of
CGM use. As recommended by the device
manufacturers and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), people with diabe-
tes using CGM must have access to BGM
for multiple reasons, including whenever
there is suspicion that the CGM is inaccu-
rate, while waiting for warm-up, when
there is a disruption in CGM transmission,
for calibration (if needed) or if a warning
message appears, when CGM supplies
are delayed, and in any clinical setting
where glucose levels are changing rapidly
(>2 mg/dL/min), which could cause a dis-
crepancy between CGM and blood glu-
cose values.

Meter Standards
Glucose meters meeting FDA guidance
for meter accuracy provide the most

reliable data for diabetes management.
There are several current standards for
the accuracy of blood glucose meters,
but the two most used are those of the
International Organization for Standardi-
zation (ISO) (ISO 15197:2013) and the
FDA. The current ISO and FDA standards
are compared in Table 7.1. In Europe,
currently marketed meters must meet
current ISO standards. In the U.S., cur-
rently marketed meters must meet the
standard under which they were ap-
proved, which may not be the current
standard. Moreover, the monitoring of
current accuracy postmarketing is left to the
manufacturer and not routinely checked by
an independent source.

People with diabetes assume their glu-
cose meter is accurate because it is FDA
cleared, but that may not be the case.
There is substantial variation in the accu-
racy of widely used BGM systems (17,18).
The Diabetes Technology Society Blood
Glucose Monitoring System Surveillance
Program provides information on the
performance of devices used for BGM
(diabetestechnology.org/surveillance/). In one
analysis, 6 of the top 18 best-selling glucose
meters met the accuracy standard (19). In a
subsequent analysis with updated glucose
meters, 14 of 18 glucose meters met the
minimum accuracy requirements (20).There
are single-meter studies in which beneﬁts
have been found with individual meter sys-
tems, but few studies have compared me-
ters head-to-head. Certain meter system
characteristics, such as the use of lancing de-
vices that are less painful (21) and the ability
to reapply blood to a strip with an insufﬁ-
cient initial sample, or meters with inte-
grated speech that can read aloud glucose
levels for visually impaired individuals (22),
may also be beneﬁcial to people with dia-
betes (23) and may make BGM less burden-
some to perform.

Counterfeit Strips
People with diabetes should be advised
against purchasing or reselling preowned
or secondhand test strips, as these may
give incorrect results. Only unopened and
unexpired vials of glucose test strips should
be used to ensure BGM accuracy.

Optimizing Blood Glucose
Monitoring Device Use
Optimal use of BGM devices requires
proper review and interpretation of data
by both the person with diabetes and the
health care professional to ensure that
data are used in an effective and timely
manner. In people with type 1 diabetes,
there is a correlation between greater
BGM frequency and lower A1C levels
(24). Among those who check their blood
glucose at least once daily, many report
taking no action when results are high
or low (25). Some meters now provide
advice to the user in real time when
monitoring glucose levels (26), whereas
others can be used as a part of integrated
health platforms (27). People with diabe-
tes should be taught how to use BGM
data to adjust food intake, physical activ-
ity, or pharmacologic therapy to achieve
speciﬁc goals. The ongoing need for and
frequency of BGM should be reevaluated
at each routine visit to ensure its effec-
tive use (24,28).

People With Diabetes on Intensive Insulin
Therapies
BGM is especially important for people with
diabetes treated with insulin to monitor for
and prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglyce-
mia. Most individuals on intensive insulin
therapies (multiple daily injections [MDI] or
insulin pump therapy) should be encour-
aged to assess glucose levels using BGM
(and/or CGM) prior to meals and snacks, at
bedtime, occasionally postprandially, prior

to, during, and after physical activity, when
they suspect hypoglycemia or hyperglyce-
mia, after treating hypoglycemia until they
are normoglycemic, and prior to and while
performing critical tasks such as driving. For
many individuals using BGM, this requires
checking up to 6–10 times daily, although
individual needs may vary. A database study
of almost 27,000 children and adolescents
with type 1 diabetes showed that, after ad-
justing for multiple confounders, increased
daily frequency of BGM was signiﬁcantly as-
sociated with lower A1C levels ((cid:1)0.2% per
additional check per day) and with fewer
acute complications (29).

People With Diabetes Using Basal Insulin
and/or Oral Agents and Noninsulin Injectables
The evidence is insufﬁcient regarding
when to prescribe BGM and how often
monitoring is needed for insulin-treated
people with diabetes who do not use
intensive insulin therapy, such as those
with type 2 diabetes taking basal insulin
with or without oral agents and/or non-
insulin injectables. However, for those tak-
ing basal insulin, assessing fasting glucose
with BGM to inform dose adjustments to
achieve blood glucose goals results in
lower A1C levels (30).

In people with type 2 diabetes not tak-
ing insulin, routine glucose monitoring
may be of limited additional clinical ben-
eﬁt. By itself, even when combined with
education, this practice has shown limited
improvement in outcomes (31). However,
for some individuals, glucose monitoring
can provide insight into the impact of nu-
trition, physical activity, and medication
management on glucose levels. Glucose
monitoring may also be useful in assessing
hypoglycemia, glucose levels during inter-
current illness, or discrepancies between
measured A1C and glucose levels when
there is concern an A1C result may not be
reliable in speciﬁc individuals (for more
details, see Section 2, “Diagnosis and
Classiﬁcation of Diabetes”). It may be use-
ful when coupled with a treatment adjust-
ment program. In a year-long study of
insulin-naive people with diabetes with sub-
optimal initial glycemic outcomes, a group
trained in structured BGM (a paper tool was
used at least quarterly to collect and inter-
pret seven-point BGM proﬁles taken on
three consecutive days) reduced their A1C
levels by 0.3% more than the control group
(32). A trial of once-daily BGM that included
enhanced feedback from people with diabe-
tes through messaging found no clinically or

statistically signiﬁcant change in A1C levels
at 1 year (31). Meta-analyses have sug-
gested that BGM can reduce A1C levels by
0.25–0.3% at 6 months (33–35), but the ef-
fect was attenuated at 12 months in one
analysis (33). Reductions in A1C levels were
greater ((cid:1)0.3%) in trials where structured
BGM data were used to adjust medications,
but A1C levels were not changed signiﬁ-
cantly without such structured diabetes
therapy adjustment (35). A key consider-
ation is that performing BGM alone does
not lower blood glucose levels. To be useful,
the information must be integrated into clin-
ical and self-management treatment plans.

Glucose Meter Inaccuracy
Although many meters function well un-
der various circumstances, health care
professionals and people with diabetes
must be aware of factors that impair me-
ter accuracy. A meter reading that seems
discordant with the clinical picture needs
to be retested or tested in a laboratory.
Health care professionals in intensive
care unit settings need to be particularly
aware of the potential for incorrect me-
ter readings during critical
illness, and
laboratory-based values should be used
if there is any doubt. Some meters give
error messages if meter readings are
likely to be false (36).

Oxygen. Currently available glucose mon-
itors use an enzymatic reaction linked to
an electrochemical reaction, either glucose
oxidase or glucose dehydrogenase (37).
Glucose oxidase monitors are sensitive to
the oxygen available and should only be
used with capillary blood in people with
normal oxygen saturation. Higher oxygen
tensions (i.e., arterial blood or oxygen ther-
apy) may result in false low-glucose read-
ings, and low oxygen tensions (i.e., high
altitude, hypoxia, or venous blood read-
ings) may lead to falsely elevated glucose
readings. Glucose dehydrogenase–based
monitors are generally not sensitive to
oxygen.

Temperature. Because the reaction is sen-
sitive to temperature, all monitors have an
acceptable temperature range (37). Most
will show an error if the temperature is un-
acceptable, but a few will provide a reading
and a message indicating that the value
may be incorrect. Humidity and altitude
may also alter glucose readings.

Interfering Substances. There are several
physiologic and pharmacologic factors
that
interfere with glucose readings
measured with either personal blood
glucose meters or professional blood
glucose meters used in various inpatient
settings (neonatal
intensive care unit,
hospital wards, and intensive care unit)
(37). They are listed in Table 7.2.

CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE
MONITORING DEVICES
See Table 7.3 for deﬁnitions of types of
CGM devices.

Recommendations
7.15 Recommend real-time CGM
(rtCGM) A or intermittently scanned
CGM (isCGM) for diabetes manage-
ment to youth C and adults B with dia-
betes on any type of insulin therapy.
The choice of CGM device should be
made based on the individual’s circum-
stances, preferences, and needs.
7.16 Consider using rtCGM and isCGM
in adults with type 2 diabetes treated
with glucose-lowering medications other
than insulin to achieve and maintain indi-
vidualized glycemic goals. The choice of
device should be made based on the in-
dividual’s circumstances, preferences,
and needs. B
7.17 In people with diabetes on insulin
therapy, rtCGM devices should be used
as close to daily as possible for maximal
beneﬁt. A isCGM devices should be
scanned frequently, at minimum once
every 8 h, to avoid gaps in data. A Peo-
ple with diabetes should have unin-
terrupted access to their supplies to
minimize gaps in CGM. A
7.18 CGM can help achieve glycemic
goals (e.g., time in range and time
above range) A and A1C goal B in type 1
diabetes and pregnancy and may be
beneﬁcial for other types of diabetes in
pregnancy. E
7.19 In circumstances when consistent
use of CGM is not feasible, consider pe-
riodic use of personal or professional
CGM to adjust medication and/or life-
style. C
7.20 Skin reactions, either due to irrita-
tion or allergy, should be assessed and
addressed to aid in successful use of
devices. E
7.21 People who wear CGM devices
should be educated on potential inter-
fering substances and other factors that
may affect accuracy. C

CGM measures interstitial glucose (which
correlates well with plasma glucose, al-
though at times, it can lag if glucose levels
are rising or falling rapidly). There are two
basic types of CGM devices. The ﬁrst type
includes those that are owned by the user,
unblinded, and intended for frequent or
continuous use, including real-time CGM
(rtCGM), intermittently scanned CGM
(isCGM), and over-the-counter CGM devi-
ces. The second type is professional CGM
devices that are owned by practices and ap-
plied in the clinic, which provide data that
are blinded or unblinded for a discrete pe-
riod of time. The types of sensors currently
available are either disposable (rtCGM and
isCGM) or implantable (rtCGM). Table
7.3 provides deﬁnitions for the types of
CGM devices. For people with type 1 diabe-
tes using CGM, frequency of sensor use is

an important predictor of A1C lowering for
all age-groups (38,39). The frequency of
scanning with isCGM devices is also corre-
lated with improved outcomes (40–43).

Few real-time systems require cali-
bration by the user, which varies in fre-
quency depending on the device. CGM
systems are generally nonadjunctive,
meaning they do not require BGM con-
ﬁrmation for treatment decisions like in-
sulin dosing or treating hypoglycemia,
except in certain clinical situations (see
BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING, above) (44–46).
Most CGM systems are designated as
integrated CGM (iCGM), a higher standard
set by the FDA for integration with other
digitally connected devices. Dexcom G6
rtCGM (no generic form available), Dex-
com G7 rtCGM (no generic form avail-
able), FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus (no generic

form available), FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus (no
generic form available), and Eversense E3
(no generic form available) are FDA ap-
proved for use with AID systems. Similarly,
Dexcom G6 rtCGM, Dexcom G7 rtCGM,
FreeStyle Libre 2 isCGM (no generic form
available), and Medtronic Simplera rtCGM
(no generic form available) are approved
for use with connected insulin pens (47).
Currently, Dexcom G6 and Dexcom G7 are
integrated with four AID systems (t:slim X2
with Control-IQ, Omnipod 5,
iLet, and
Mobi). Similarly, at this time in the U.S.,
the FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus is integrated with
one AID system (t:slim X2 with Control-IQ)
and the FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus with another
AID system (iLet). Finally, the Medtronic
Guardian 3 rtCGM (no generic form avail-
able) and the Medtronic Guardian 4 rtCGM
(no generic form available) are FDA ap-
proved for use with the 670/770G and
780G AID systems, respectively.

Benefits of Continuous Glucose
Monitoring
Data From Randomized Controlled Trials
Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
have been performed using rtCGM devices,
and the results have largely been positive in
terms of reducing A1C levels and/or epi-
sodes of hypoglycemia if participants regu-
larly wore the devices (38–41,48–51). The
initial studies were done primarily in adults
and youth with type 1 diabetes on insulin
pump therapy and/or MDI (38,39,48,49,
52). The primary outcome was met and
showed beneﬁt in adults of all ages
(38,53,54), including seniors (55–57).
Data in children show that rtCGM use
in young children with type 1 diabetes
reduced hypoglycemia; in addition, be-
havioral support of parents of young

CGM devices that are placed on the person with diabetes in the health care professional’s ofﬁce

and worn for a discrete period of time (generally 7–14 days). Data may be blinded or visible to
the person wearing the device. The data are used to assess glycemic patterns and trends. Unlike
rtCGM and isCGM devices, these devices are clinic-based and not owned by the person with
diabetes.

Over-the-counter CGM

CGM devices called biosensors, which measure glucose continuously and display the levels at

various times, have insights rather than alarms and are indicated for people with prediabetes or
with diabetes not on insulin.

CGM, continuous glucose monitoring; isCGM, intermittently scanned CGM; rtCGM, real-time CGM.

children with diabetes using rtCGM showed
the beneﬁts of reducing hypoglycemia
concerns and diabetes distress (38,49,58).
Similarly, A1C level reduction was seen in
adolescents and young adults with type 1
diabetes using rtCGM (48). RCT data on
rtCGM use in individuals with type 2 dia-
betes on MDI (59), mixed therapies (10,
60), and basal insulin (61,62) have consis-
tently shown reductions in A1C levels and
increases in TIR (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10
mmol/L]) but not a reduction in rates of
hypoglycemia (63). Although short-term
use of rtCGM in youth with type 2 diabe-
tes did not impact short-term glucose
changes or A1C improvement, users re-
ported behavioral changes with increased
blood glucose measurements, increased
insulin administration, and overall
im-
proved diabetes management and quality
of life (64,65). The improvements in type 2
diabetes have largely occurred without
changes in insulin doses or other diabetes
medications. CGM discontinuation in indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin
caused partial reversal of A1C reduction
and TIR improvements, suggesting that
continued CGM use achieves the great-
est beneﬁts (15).

RCT data for rtCGM beneﬁts in people
with type 2 diabetes not using insulin are
increasing and generally have shown
greater beneﬁts of CGM compared with
BGM for A1C, TIR, time below range (TBR),
and time above range (TAR) as well as
greater user-reported satisfaction (66).
These beneﬁts were initially reported in a
study where the intermittent use of rtCGM
for either one session or two sessions (3
months apart) versus control treatment
showed improvement of A1C at 3 months.
At 6 months, the two-session rtCGM
group achieved signiﬁcant A1C reduction.
For both rtCGM groups, participants who
measured BGM at least 1.5 times per day
achieved greater A1C improvement com-
pared with the control group (67).

In addition, rtCGM beneﬁts were re-
ported in a mixed population (including
people not using insulin) of adults with
type 2 diabetes with reduction in A1C levels,
increase in TIR, and reduction of time in hy-
perglycemia (>180 mg/dL [>10 mmol/L]
and >250 mg/dL [>13.9 mmol/L]) (10).

RCT data for isCGM are fewer but in-
creasing. One study was performed in
adults with type 1 diabetes and met its pri-
mary outcome of a reduction in rates of
hypoglycemia (68). In adults with type 2 di-
abetes using insulin, two studies were

done: one study did not meet its primary
end point of A1C level reduction (69) but
achieved a secondary end point of a reduc-
tion in hypoglycemia, and the other study
met its primary end point of an improve-
ment in the Diabetes Treatment Satisfac-
tion Questionnaire score as well as a
secondary end point of A1C level reduc-
tion (70). In a study of individuals with
type 1 or type 2 diabetes taking insulin,
the primary outcome of a reduction in se-
vere hypoglycemia was not met and the
incidence of severe hypoglycemia was not
signiﬁcantly different between isCGM
users and the BGM group (71). One study
in youth with type 1 diabetes did not
show a reduction in A1C levels (72); how-
ever, the device was well received and
was associated with an increased fre-
quency of testing and improved diabetes
treatment satisfaction (72). A random-
ized trial of adults with type 1 diabetes
showed that the use of isCGM with op-
tional alerts and alarms resulted in reduc-
tion of A1C levels compared with BGM
use (9).

The beneﬁts of isCGM for adults with
type 2 diabetes not using insulin were ini-
tially reported in a multicenter, open-
label, randomized (1:1), parallel-group
study. At 12 weeks, A1C was signiﬁcantly
reduced from baseline in both groups
without difference. However, at 24 weeks,
the isCGM group showed a greater A1C
reduction than the control group. Further-
more, there were no between-group dif-
ferences in change of antihyperglycemic
drugs (73). In a subsequent post hoc anal-
ysis, the isCGM group showed that the ef-
fects of isCGM were present 1 week after
isCGM initiation for weekly mean glucose,
glucose management indicator (GMI), per-
centage of TIR, percentage of TAR, and
mean amplitude glucose excursion and re-
mained stable from baseline to 12 weeks
(74). Additionally, beneﬁts of isCGM were
also reported in an RCT where the use of
isCGM plus diabetes education versus dia-
betes education alone showed decreased
A1C levels and increased TIR as well as in-
creased time in tight target range (70–140
mg/dL [3.9–7.8 mmol/L]) in the isCGM-
plus-education group (8).

Observational and Real-world Studies
CGM systems are widely available in
many countries for people with diabe-
tes, and this allows for the collection of
large amounts of data across groups of
people with diabetes.

Data for isCGM in adults with diabetes
include results from observational studies,
retrospective studies, and analyses of regis-
try and population data (75,76). In individu-
als with type 1 diabetes wearing isCGM
devices, studies have shown improvement
in A1C levels (41,77), TIR (70–180 mg/dL
[3.9–10.0 mmol/L]), and hypoglycemia
(41,43,75,78,79). Reductions in acute dia-
betes complications, such as diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA), episodes of severe
hypoglycemia or diabetes-related coma,
and hospitalizations for hypoglycemia
and hyperglycemia, have been observed
in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
(43,78,80), with persistent effects ob-
served even after 2 years of CGM initia-
tion (81). Similar reductions of acute
diabetes events and all-cause inpatient
hospitalizations were seen in a retro-
spective review of adults with type 2 di-
abetes treated with basal insulin or with
noninsulin therapy 6 months after initia-
tion of isCGM (82). Prospective observa-
tional as well as retrospective studies in
adults with type 2 diabetes treated with
MDI showed signiﬁcant reduction of A1C
and hypoglycemia (83) after 12 weeks of
isCGM use, with increased user satisfac-
tion (83). Similar results were seen in a ret-
rospective study with adults with type 2
diabetes on basal insulin at 3–6 months
(84). Furthermore, retrospective observa-
tional data in adults with type 2 diabetes
treated with either basal insulin or nonin-
sulin therapy have shown an improvement
in A1C levels (85). Finally, a retrospective
study of continued use of isCGM in adults
with nonintensively treated type 2 diabetes
showed reduction of A1C and GMI, increase
in TIR, and reduction of TAR (>180 mg/dL)
(86). Results of self-reported outcomes var-
ied, but, where measured, people with
diabetes had an increase in treatment
satisfaction with isCGM compared with
BGM. In an observational study in youth
with type 1 diabetes, a slight increase in
A1C levels and weight was seen, but the
device was associated with a high user
satisfaction rate (76).

Retrospective data from rtCGM use
in adults (87) with type 1 or type 2 dia-
betes treated with insulin showed that
the use of rtCGM signiﬁcantly lowered
A1C levels and reduced rates of emer-
gency department visits or hospitalizations
for hypoglycemia but did not signiﬁcantly
lower overall
rates of emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, or
hyperglycemia.

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Recent data have emerged from a real-
world observational analysis of rtCGM use
in adults with type 2 diabetes not treated
with insulin. In this study, rtCGM beneﬁts
were observed at 6 month and 12 months
versus baseline, with reduction of mean glu-
cose levels, reduction of GMI, increase in
TIR, increase in time in tight target range
(70–140 mg/dL [3.9–7.8 mmol/L]), and re-
duction in TAR >180 and >250 mg/dL (88).

Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Compared With Intermittently Scanned Con-
tinuous Glucose Monitoring
In adults with type 1 diabetes, three RCTs
have been conducted comparing isCGM
(without predictive alerts/alarms) and
rtCGM (with predictive alerts/alarms)
(84,89,90). In two of the studies, the pri-
mary outcome was a reduction in time
spent in hypoglycemia, and rtCGM showed
greater beneﬁts compared with isCGM
(89,90). In the other study, the primary out-
come was improved TIR, and rtCGM also
showed greater beneﬁts compared with
isCGM (84). A retrospective analysis also
showed improvement in TIR with rtCGM
compared with isCGM (91). A more recent
12-month real-world nonrandomized study
compared rtCGM with isCGM in adults
with type 1 diabetes. At 12 months, A1C
levels, time in level 1 hypoglycemia
(<70 mg/dL [<3.9 mmol/L]), and time
in level 2 hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL
[<3.0 mmol/L]) were all lower in the
rtCGM group than in the isCGM group;
similarly, the TIR was higher in the rtCGM
group than in the isCGM group (92).

Data Analysis
The abundance of data provided by CGM
offers opportunities to analyze data for
people with diabetes more granularly than
previously possible, providing additional
information to aid in achieving glycemic
goals. A variety of metrics have been pro-
posed (93) and are discussed in Section 6,
“Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia.” CGM
is essential for creating an ambulatory
glucose proﬁle (AGP) and providing data
on TIR, percentage of time spent above
and below range, and glycemic variability
(94). Standardized reports for CGM, AID,
and connected insulin pens include
multiple reports, each providing different
degrees of
information. These reports,
whether single page or with raw data,
should be used in clinical practice to iden-
tify CGM trends and patterns; in the set-
ting of AID systems, these reports provide

important information on insulin delivery
and its suspension or modulation as well
as information on automated bolus deliv-
ery that can assist the clinician in making
therapy adjustments (12,94,95). However,
data analysis can be burdensome without
a systematic approach to its review, and
CGM and AID manufacturers should aim
to make device data reports as standard-
ized as possible to reduce the burden
of data analysis (12). Several efforts
have been made to streamline the inter-
pretation of CGM reports to assist health
care professionals in their daily practice.
These have various, but overall similar, ap-
proaches.The initial steps are focused on as-
sessing the sufﬁciency and quality of data;
subsequent recommendations include re-
viewing the presence and trends or patterns
of hypoglycemia, followed by hyperglycemia
patterns and trends. Some authors also sug-
gest approaches to changing therapy plans
based on the data reviewed that enable
health care professionals to make a simple
yet comprehensive review and plan of care
even within the time constraints of ofﬁce
visits (96–100).

Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Device Use in Pregnancy
CGM indication is now expanded to in-
clude pregnancy for Dexcom G7, FreeStyle
Libre 2, and FreeStyle Libre 3, which will
enhance care in this population (101,102).
Prior data from one well-designed RCT
showed a reduction in A1C levels in preg-
nant adults with type 1 diabetes on MDI
or insulin pump therapy and using rtCGM
in addition to standard care; CGM users
experienced more pregnancy-speciﬁc TIR
(63–140 mg/dL [3.5–7.8 mmol/L]) and
less time in hyperglycemia (103). This
study demonstrated the value of rtCGM
in pregnancy complicated by type 1 diabe-
tes by showing a mild improvement in
A1C levels and a signiﬁcant improvement
in the maternal glucose TIR for pregnancy
(63–140 mg/dL [3.5–7.8 mmol/L]), with-
out an increase in hypoglycemia, as well
as reductions in large-for-gestational-age
births, infant hospital length of stay, and
severe neonatal hypoglycemia (103). An
observational cohort study that evaluated
the glycemic variables reported using
rtCGM and isCGM found that lower mean
glucose, lower SD, and higher percentage
of TIR were associated with lower risks of
large-for-gestational-age births and other
adverse neonatal outcomes (104). An-
other observational study in pregnancies

with and without gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM) wearing blinded CGM
found higher mean glucose, more time
spent at >120 mg/dL and >140 mg/dL,
and less time spent at 63–120 mg/dL
were associated with large-for-gesta-
tional-age births and gestational hyper-
tensive disorders, while lower mean
glucose and more time spent at <63
mg/dL and <54 mg/dL were associated
with small-for-gestational-age birth
(105). Data from one study suggested
that the use of rtCGM-reported mean
glucose is superior to use of the glucose
management indicator and other calcula-
tions to estimate A1C levels given the
changes to A1C levels that occur in preg-
nancy (106). Two studies employing inter-
mittent use of
rtCGM showed no
difference in neonatal outcomes in indi-
viduals with type 1 diabetes (107) or ges-
tational diabetes mellitus (108). At this
time, data are insufﬁcient to recommend
the use of CGM in all pregnant people
with type 2 diabetes or GDM (109,110).
The decision of whether to use CGM in
pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes
or GDM should be individualized based on
treatment plan, circumstances, preferen-
ces, and needs.

Although CGM systems for use in preg-
nancy do not require calibrations and are
approved for nonadjunctive use, when us-
ing CGM in diabetes and pregnancy, deter-
mination of glucose levels by ﬁnger stick
may be necessary in certain circumstances,
such as in the setting of hypoglycemia or
hyperglycemia outside the recommended
CGM goal ranges (63–140 mg/dL [3.5–7.8
mmol/L]) during pregnancy.

Use of Professional Continuous Glucose
Monitoring and Intermittent Use of
Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Professional CGM devices, which provide
retrospective data, either blinded or un-
blinded, for analysis can be used to identify
patterns of hypoglycemia and hyperglyce-
mia (111,112). Professional CGM can be
helpful to evaluate an individual’s glucose
levels when either rtCGM or isCGM is not
available to the individual or they prefer a
blinded analysis or a shorter experience
with unblinded data. It can be particularly
useful in individuals using agents that can
cause hypoglycemia, as the data can be
used to evaluate periods of hypoglycemia
and make medication dose adjustments if
needed. It can also be useful to evaluate
periods of hyperglycemia.

Furthermore,

Some data have shown the beneﬁt of
intermittent use of CGM (rtCGM or
isCGM) in individuals with type 2 diabe-
tes on noninsulin and/or basal
insulin
therapies (60,73). In these RCTs, people
with type 2 diabetes not on intensive
insulin therapy used CGM intermittently
compared with those randomized to
BGM. Both early (60) and late improve-
ments in A1C levels were found (60,73).
in a real-world study,
the use of professional CGM in individu-
als with type 2 diabetes not on insulin
at baseline and at 6 months of follow-
up resulted in lower A1C at 6 months
as well as a shift toward greater use of
glucose-lowering medications with car-
diometabolic beneﬁts, such as sodium–
glucose transporter 2 inhibitors and
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ago-
nists (113). Use of professional or inter-
mittent CGM should always be coupled
with analysis and interpretation for peo-
ple with diabetes along with education,
as needed, to adjust medication and
change lifestyle behaviors (114–116).

Side Effects of Continuous Glucose
Monitoring Devices
Contact dermatitis (both irritant and aller-
gic) has been reported with all devices that
attach to the skin (20,117,118). In some
cases, this has been linked to the presence
of isobornyl acrylate, a skin sensitizer that
can cause an additional spreading allergic
reaction (119–121). It is important to ask
CGM users periodically about adhesive re-
actions, as tape formulations may change
over time. Patch testing can sometimes
identify the cause of contact dermatitis
(122). Identifying and eliminating tape al-
lergens is important to ensure the comfort-
able use of devices and promote self-care

(123–126). The PANTHER Program offers
resources in English and Spanish at www.
pantherprogram.org/skin-solutions. In some
instances, using an implanted sensor can
help avoid skin reactions in those sensitive
to tape (127,128).

Substances and Factors Affecting
Continuous Glucose Monitoring Accuracy
Sensor interference due to several medica-
tions/substances is a known potential source
of CGM sensor measurement errors (Table
7.4). While several of these substances have
been reported in the various CGM brands’
user manuals, additional
interferences
have been discovered after the market
release of these products. Hydroxyurea,
used for myeloproliferative disorders and
hematologic conditions,
is one of the
most recently identiﬁed interfering sub-
stances that cause a temporary increase
in sensor glucose values discrepant from
actual glucose values (129–134). Similarly,
substances such as mannitol and sorbitol,
when administered intravenously or as a
component of peritoneal dialysis solution,
may increase blood mannitol or sorbitol
concentrations and cause falsely elevated
readings of sensor glucose (135). There-
fore, it is crucial to routinely review the
medications and supplements used by the
person with diabetes to identify possible
interfering substances and advise them
accordingly on the need to use additional
BGM if sensor values are unreliable due to
these substances.

INSULIN DELIVERY

Insulin Syringes and Pens

Recommendations
7.22 For people with insulin-requiring
diabetes on multiple daily injections

(MDI),
insulin pens are preferred in
most cases. Still, insulin syringes may
be used for insulin delivery considering
individual and caregiver preference, in-
sulin type, availability in vials, dosing
therapy, cost, and self-management ca-
pabilities. C
7.23 Insulin pens or insulin injection aids
are recommended for people with
dexterity issues or vision impairment
or when decided by shared decision-
making to facilitate the accurate dos-
ing and administration of insulin. C
7.24 Offer connected insulin pens for
people with diabetes taking multiple
daily insulin injections. B
7.25 FDA-approved insulin dose calcula-
tors/decision support systems may be
helpful for calculating insulin doses. B

Injecting insulin with a syringe or pen
(136–147) is the insulin delivery method
used by most people with diabetes (142,148),
although inhaled insulin is also available.
Others use insulin pumps or AID devices (see
INSULIN PUMPS AND AUTOMATED INSULIN DELIVERY SYSTEMS,
below). For people with diabetes who use
insulin, insulin syringes and pens both can
deliver insulin safely and effectively for the
achievement of glycemic goals. Individual
preferences, cost, insulin type, dosing ther-
apy, and self-management capabilities should
be considered when choosing among delivery
systems. Trials with insulin pens generally
show equivalence or small improvements in
glycemic outcomes compared with using a
vial and syringe. Many individuals with diabe-
tes prefer using a pen because of its simplicity
and convenience. It is important to note that
while many insulin types are available for pur-
chase as either pens or vials, others may be

available in only one form or the other, and
there may be signiﬁcant cost differences be-
tween pens and vials (see Table 9.4 for a list
of
insulin product costs with dosage
forms). Insulin pens may allow people
with vision impairment or dexterity issues
to dose insulin accurately (149–151), and
insulin injection aids are also available to
help with these issues. (For a helpful list of
injection aids, see living-with-diabetes/
treatment-care/diabetes-technology-guide).
Inhaled technosphere insulin can be useful
for people with diabetes, providing an alter-
native method of insulin delivery with very
fast onset of action. In a recent randomized
clinical trial, the use of technosphere inhaled
insulin showed lower postprandial hypergly-
cemia than subcutaneous rapid-acting ana-
log insulin (152).

The most common syringe sizes are
1 mL, 0.5 mL, and 0.3 mL, allowing doses
of up to 100 units, 50 units, and 30 units,
respectively, of U-100 insulin. Some 0.3-mL
syringes have half-unit markings, whereas
other syringes have markings in 1- to 2-unit
increments. In a few parts of the world, in-
sulin syringes still have U-80 and U-40
markings for older insulin concentrations
and veterinary insulin, and U-500 syrin-
ges are available for the use of U-500 in-
sulin. Syringes are generally used once
but may be reused by the same individual
in resource-limited settings with appro-
priate storage and cleansing (151).

Insulin pens offer added convenience by
combining the vial and syringe into a single
device. Insulin pens, allowing push-button
injections, come as disposable pens with
preﬁlled cartridges or reusable insulin pens
with replaceable insulin cartridges. Pens
vary with respect to dosing increment and
minimal dose, ranging from half-unit doses
to 2-unit dose increments, with the latter
available in U-200 insulin pens. U-500 pens
come in 5-unit dose increments. Some re-
usable pens include a memory function,
which can recall dose amounts and timing.
Insulin pens, once started, can be kept in
use for variable durations, based on the type
of insulin, usually for 28 days, ranging from
14 to 56 days. Needle thickness (gauge) and
length are other considerations. Needle
gauges range from 22 to 34, with a higher
gauge indicating a thinner needle. A thicker
needle can give a dose of insulin more
quickly, while a thinner needle may cause
less pain. Needle length ranges from 4 to
12.7 mm, with some evidence suggesting
that shorter needles (4–5 mm) lower the

risk of intramuscular injection with erratic
absorption and possibly the development
of lipohypertrophy. When reused, needles
may be duller and thus injections may be
more painful. Proper insulin injection
technique is a requisite for receiving the
full dose of insulin with each injection.
Concerns with technique and use of the
proper technique are outlined in Section
9, “Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic
Treatment.”

Connected insulin pens are insulin pens
with the capacity to record and/or trans-
mit insulin dose data. Insulin pen caps are
also available and are placed on existing in-
sulin pens and may assist with calculating in-
sulin doses and by providing a memory
function. Some connected insulin pens and
pen caps can be programmed to calculate
insulin doses, can be synced with select
CGM systems, and can provide download-
able data reports. These pens and pen caps
are useful to people with diabetes for real-
time insulin dosing and allow clinicians to
retrospectively review the insulin delivery
times and, in some cases, doses and glucose
data to make informed insulin dose adjust-
ments (153). A quantitative study showed
that people with diabetes preferred con-
nected pens because of their ability to log in-
sulin doses and glucose levels automatically
(153). In a multicenter RCT in people with
type 1 diabetes, the use of an insulin pen
cap was associated with improved glycemic
outcomes at 6 weeks in the insulin cap
group, with an increase in TIR and decrease
in GMI and TAR (154). A systematic review
of connected insulin pens or pen caps
showed improvement of glucose outcomes
whether as A1C reduction, TIR increase, or
hypoglycemia reduction (155). A recent real-
world study with multinational data col-
lected from 3,954 adults with diabetes using
a connected pen and CGM validated the
fact that treatment engagement with a con-
nected insulin pen is positively associated
with glycemic outcomes. On the other hand,
missing as little as two basal doses or four
bolus insulin doses over a 14-day period
would be associated with a clinically relevant
decrease in TIR of $5% (156).

Bolus calculators have been devel-
oped to aid dosing decisions (157–162).
These systems are subject to FDA ap-
proval to ensure safety and efﬁcacy in
terms of algorithms used and subse-
quent dosing recommendations. People
interested in using these systems should
be encouraged to use those that are
FDA approved. Health care professional

input and education can be helpful for
setting the initial dosing calculations
with ongoing follow-up for adjustments
as needed.

Insulin Pumps and Automated
Insulin Delivery Systems

Recommendations
7.26 AID systems should be the pre-
ferred insulin delivery method to im-
prove glycemic outcomes and reduce
hypoglycemia and disparities in youth
and adults with type 1 diabetes A and
other types of insulin-deﬁcient diabetes
E who are capable of using the device
(either by themselves or with a care-
giver). Choice of an AID system should
be made based on the individual’s cir-
cumstances, preferences, and needs. A
7.27 Insulin pump therapy, preferably
with CGM, should be offered for diabe-
tes management to youth and adults
on MDI with type 2 diabetes who can
use the device safely (either by them-
selves or with a caregiver). The choice
of device should be made based on
the individual’s circumstances, preferen-
ces, and needs. A
7.28 Individuals with diabetes who have
been using CSII should have continued
access across third-party payors. E

Insulin Pumps
Insulin pumps have been available in the
U.S. for over 40 years. These devices deliver
rapid-acting insulin throughout the day to
help manage glucose levels. Most insulin
pumps use tubing to deliver insulin through
a cannula, while a few attach directly to
the skin without tubing (pods or patch
pumps), and these systems have been ap-
proved for use in type 1 and type 2 diabe-
tes. AID systems, which can adjust insulin
delivery rates based on sensor glucose
values, are preferred over nonautomated
pumps and MDI in people with type 1 dia-
betes and have largely replaced the use of
nonintegrated or standard insulin pumps.
Recently, one AID system was approved
for use by people with type 2 diabetes.

Historically, studies that compared MDI
with insulin pump therapy were relatively
small and of short duration. However, a
systematic review and meta-analysis con-
cluded that pump therapy has modest ad-
vantages for lowering A1C levels ((cid:1)0.30%
[95% CI (cid:1)0.58 to (cid:1)0.02]) and for reducing
severe hypoglycemia rates in children and
adults (163). Real-world data on insulin

pump use in individuals with type 1 diabe-
tes show beneﬁts in A1C levels and hypo-
glycemia reductions as well as total daily
insulin dose reduction (164). There is no
consensus to guide choices on which form
of insulin administration is best for a given
individual, and research to guide this deci-
sion-making process is needed (163). Thus,
the choice of MDI or an insulin pump is of-
ten based on the characteristics of the per-
son with diabetes and which method is
most likely to beneﬁt them. DiabetesWise
(diabeteswise.org/), for individuals with dia-
betes, DiabetesWise Pro (pro.diabeteswise
.org/), for health care professionals, and the
PANTHER Program (pantherprogram
.org/device-comparison-chart) have helpful
websites to assist health care professionals
and people with diabetes in choosing diabe-
tes devices based on their individual needs
and the features of the devices. Newer sys-
tems, such as sensor-augmented pumps
(SAPs) and AID systems, are discussed
below.

Adoption of pump therapy in the U.S.
shows geographical variations, which may
be related to health care professional prefer-
ence or center characteristics (165,166) and
socioeconomic status, as pump therapy is
more common in individuals of higher socio-
economic status, as reﬂected by private
health insurance, family income, and educa-
tion (165,166). Given the additional barriers
to optimal diabetes care observed in disad-
vantaged groups (167), addressing the dif-
ferences in access to insulin pumps and
other diabetes technologies may contribute
to fewer health disparities.

Pump therapy can be successfully started
at the time of diagnosis (168). Practical as-
pects of pump therapy initiation include as-
sessment of readiness of the person with
diabetes and their family, if applicable (al-
though there is no consensus on which fac-
tors to consider in adults [169] or children
and adolescents with diabetes), selection of
pump type and initial pump settings, individ-
ual and family education on potential pump
complications (e.g., DKA with infusion set
failure), transition from MDI, and intro-
duction of advanced pump settings (e.g.,
temporary basal rates and extended bolus,
square-wave bolus, or dual-wave bolus).

Older individuals with type 1 diabetes
beneﬁt from ongoing insulin pump ther-
apy.There are no data to suggest that mea-
surement of C-peptide levels or antibodies
predicts success with insulin pump therapy
(170,171). Additionally, the frequency of
follow-up does not inﬂuence outcomes.

Access to insulin pump therapy, including
AID systems, should be allowed or contin-
ued in older adults as it is in younger
people.

Complications of the pump can be
caused by issues with infusion sets (dis-
lodgement and occlusion), which put in-
dividuals at risk for ketosis and DKA and
thus must be recognized and managed
early (172). Other pump skin issues in-
clude lipohypertrophy or, less frequently,
lipoatrophy (173) and pump site infection.
Discontinuation of pump therapy is rela-
tively uncommon today; the frequency has
decreased over the past few decades, and
its causes have changed (174). Current rea-
sons for attrition are problems with cost or
wearability, loss of insurance, dislike of the
pump, suboptimal glycemic outcomes, or
mood disorders (e.g., anxiety or depres-
sion) (175).

Insulin Pumps in Youth
The safety of insulin pumps in youth
has been established for over 15 years
(176). Studying the effectiveness of in-
sulin pump therapy in lowering A1C lev-
els has been challenging because of the
potential selection bias of observational
studies. Participants on insulin pump ther-
apy may have a higher socioeconomic sta-
tus that may facilitate better glycemic
outcomes (177) than MDI. In addition, the
fast pace of development of new insulins
and technologies quickly renders compari-
sons obsolete. However, RCTs that com-
pared insulin pumps and MDI with rapid-
acting insulin analogs demonstrated a
modest improvement in A1C levels in partic-
ipants on insulin pump therapy (178,179).
Observational studies, registry data, and
meta-analyses have also suggested an im-
provement in glycemic outcomes in partici-
pants on insulin pump therapy (180–182).
Data suggest that insulin pumps reduce the
rates of severe hypoglycemia compared
with MDI (182–185).

There is also evidence that insulin pump
therapy may reduce DKA risk (182,186)
and diabetes complications, particularly
retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy in
youth, compared with MDI (169). In addi-
tion, treatment satisfaction and quality-of-
life measures improved on insulin pump
therapy compared with MDI (187). There-
fore, insulin pumps can be used safely and
effectively in youth with type 1 diabetes to
assist with achieving targeted glycemic out-
comes while reducing the risk of hypoglyce-
mia and DKA, improving quality of life, and

preventing long-term complications. Based
on shared decision-making by people with
diabetes and health care professionals, in-
sulin pumps may be considered in all chil-
dren and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
In particular, pump therapy may be the pre-
ferred mode of insulin delivery for children
under 7 years of age (188). Because of a
paucity of data in adolescents and youth
with type 2 diabetes, there is insufﬁcient
evidence to make recommendations.

Common barriers to pump therapy
adoption in children and adolescents are
concerns regarding the physical interfer-
ence of the device, discomfort with the
idea of having a device on the body, ther-
apeutic effectiveness, and ﬁnancial bur-
den (180,189).

Sensor-Augmented Pumps
SAPs (or partial closed-loop systems)
consist of three components: an insulin
pump, a CGM system, and an algorithm
that automates insulin suspension when
glucose is low or is predicted to go low
within the next 30 min. Predictive low-
glucose suspend systems have been shown to
reduce time spent with glucose <70 mg/dL
without rebound hyperglycemia during a
6-week randomized crossover trial (190).
Similar results were seen in additional stud-
ies in adults and children with reduction of
hypoglycemia (191–193). SAPs have now
been largely replaced by AID systems, which
offer superior beneﬁts for glycemic out-
comes; nevertheless, some AID systems can
still be used in either low-glucose suspend
mode or predictive low-glucose suspend
mode.

Automated Insulin Delivery Systems
AID systems consist of mainly three com-
ponents: an insulin pump, a CGM system,
and an algorithm that determines insulin
delivery. Based on the model and brand
of currently FDA approved AID systems,
the algorithm can be hosted in the pump
body, in an insulin pod, or on a phone
app. All AID systems on the market today
integrate with one or more CGM systems
and adjust insulin delivery either by mod-
ulating the preprogrammed basal rates
or by replacing the basal rates with mi-
croboluses or microdoses of insulin every
5 min.

The modulation of insulin delivery is
done by increasing, decreasing, or paus-
ing insulin based on the CGM feedback,
the predicted direction of the glucose
levels, and the speed with which the

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

glucose levels are changing. Different
AID systems modulate insulin based on
predicted glucose levels at various times,
most commonly 30 min or 1 h. Currently
available AID systems have either ﬁxed
glucose targets or adjustable glucose targets,
generally ranging from 100 to 120 mg/dL,
with some exceptions where glucose targets
can be adjusted up to 150 mg/dL. Glucose
targets are generally set up for 24 h but can
also be adjusted in some systems with up to
eight segments per day. All current AID sys-
tems provide automated correction doses,
whether embedded in the microdose ad-
justments every 5 min or by providing addi-
tional correction boluses whose doses are
dependent on the various types of algo-
rithms with variable frequency and thresh-
old glucose based on the type of control
algorithm. Most AID systems can be used
in manual mode, although this is generally
not recommended, as the beneﬁts of CGM
modulation may be partially or totally lost.
However, use of AID in manual mode
may be necessary in some circumstances,
therefore it is important to review and re-
assess manual-mode settings periodically.
Current AID systems still require manual
entry of carbohydrates for meal announce-
ments or qualitative meal estimation an-
nouncements to calculate prandial doses.

Adjustments for physical activity are
available in most AID systems currently on
the market. These can be programmed in
various time increments. In general, the
glucose target is raised to prespeciﬁed lev-
els based on AID systems, and these are of-
ten accompanied by more conservative
insulin delivery to reduce the risk of hypo-
glycemia in the setting of increased insulin
sensitivity other than physical activity, such
as prolonged fasting or NPO status for pro-
cedures. Of note, some systems may still
give autocorrection boluses if the glucose
levels rise above a certain threshold even
while the exercise/activity mode has been
enabled. Details on the available AID sys-
tems and their features can be found at
pantherprogram.org/device-type.

AID systems have largely replaced other
methods of continuous subcutaneous in-
sulin delivery due to the advantages they
offer in insulin modulation and sophis-
tication of algorithms to adjust insulin
doses and minimize hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia.

Data From Pivotal Trials
All currently FDA-approved AID systems
were tested for safety and efﬁcacy in

in A1C,

their pivotal trials in children and adults
with type 1 diabetes (194–206). These
studies were conducted either as a sin-
gle arm of manual mode followed by
automated mode of a speciﬁc AID sys-
tem or as an RCT comparing the AID system
to an SAP and/or usual care. Regardless of
the study design, all AID system pivotal tri-
als that examined individuals 2 years old or
older, including older adults, have consis-
tently demonstrated superiority to either
standard insulin delivery (or manual mode
for the single-arm studies) or SAP and/or
usual care (for the randomized trials), with
consistent
in-
improvement
crease in TIR, especially overnight, as
well as reduction of time spent in hypo-
glycemia (207–219). The greatest im-
provements were seen with AID when
used in individuals with the highest base-
line A1C or lowest TIR (220). These systems
may also lower the risk of exercise-related
hypoglycemia (219) and have been shown
to have psychosocial beneﬁts (221–225). A
review of the literature on the health and
economic value of AID systems in individu-
als with type 1 diabetes found that AID sys-
tems are cost-effective (226). AID is rapidly
becoming the standard of care for people
with type 1 diabetes and should be the
preferred method of insulin delivery in
these individuals. The decision to use AID
systems should be made based on the
preference of the person with diabetes
and the selection of individuals (and/or
caregivers) who are capable of safely and
effectively using the devices.

Data From Real-world Studies
Data from real-world studies on AID sys-
tems have become available and con-
tinue to increase rapidly. These studies
include large numbers of users, at times
even 30-fold higher than the number of
people studied in AID pivotal trials (227).
It is important to emphasize that for
some AID systems all data are automati-
cally collected to the database (228),
whereas for other systems data are col-
lected based on voluntary sharing to the da-
tabase by AID users. A recent systematic
review of AID real-world studies, with 20
studies representing 171,209 individuals,
substantiated the results observed in the
pivotal trials and have conﬁrmed the clinical
beneﬁts of AID systems in people with type 1
diabetes. Newer systems have shown in-
creased time spent in automation, and
the real-world studies have retrospec-
tively analyzed longer duration of system

use compared with their respective piv-
otal trials, with most analyses occurring
for more than 6 months and an average
duration of 9 months (227).

Beneﬁts include improvement in A1C
levels, TIR, and other glucometrics as
well as psychosocial beneﬁts (229–234).
Finally, real-world data showed that AID
systems provide the same glycemic bene-
ﬁts to Medicare and Medicaid beneﬁciaries
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, emphasiz-
ing that access to this technology should be
made available regardless of A1C levels and
should be based on the individual’s needs
(235).

Automated Insulin Delivery Systems in
Pregnancy
The use of AID systems in diabetes and
pregnancy presents particular challenges,
as the current FDA-approved AID systems
(except for one that has been FDA ap-
proved but is not yet commercially avail-
able) have glucose goals that are not
pregnancy speciﬁc and do not have algo-
rithms designed to achieve pregnancy-
speciﬁc glucose goals. Initiating or continu-
ing AID systems during pregnancy needs to
be assessed carefully. Selected individuals
with type 1 diabetes should be evaluated
as potential candidates for AID systems in
the setting of expert guidance. Recent data
have shown the clinical beneﬁts and safety
of AID use, even though only one study
used an AID system with a pregnancy-
speciﬁc glycemic target. This study, a multi-
center, controlled trial, enrolled pregnant
women with type 1 diabetes before
14 weeks’ gestation and randomized them
by week 16 to the AID system or standard
care (MDI with CGM or standard insulin
pump therapy with CGM). The primary out-
come of time spent in the pregnancy-spe-
ciﬁc target range of 63–140 mg/dL was
found to be 10.5% higher in the AID group
versus standard care (P < 0.001). The sec-
ondary outcomes were also met, with less
time spent above range (>140 mg/dL) in
the AID group, greater overnight time in
target range, and lower A1C (236). There
were no differences in the number of pre-
term births, birth weight, neonatal compli-
cations, or admission to the neonatal
intensive care unit.

Additional data were reported from a
pilot RCT of SAP without automation ver-
sus assisted hybrid closed-loop therapy in
pregnant women with type 1 diabetes that
enrolled participants in the ﬁrst trimester
and randomized them at 14–18 weeks’

gestation. This system did not have preg-
nancy-speciﬁc glucose targets; however,
the results showed that the time in hypogly-
cemia <54 mg/dL did not differ between
groups. Time at <63 mg/dL was lower in
the hybrid closed-loop group, whereas
percentage of the pregnancy-speciﬁc
TIR was greater in the SAP group in the third
trimester, with similar safety and adverse
pregnancy outcomes between groups
(237). There were no statistically signiﬁ-
cant differences in measures of glycemic
risk or in measures of glycemic variability
between the hybrid closed-loop and the
SAP groups at any point during pregnancy or
postpartum (238). In another study with an
AID system with a lowest glucose target of
100 mg/dL, participants were randomized to
AID or standard of care in the ﬁrst trimester
and for the rest of gestation. The 24-h per-
centage of pregnancy-speciﬁc TIR was not
different between groups, but the overnight
percentage of pregnancy-speciﬁc TIR was
higher in the AID group while using assistive
techniques. Time spent below range was
lower over 24 h and overnight in the AID
group as well. Quality-of-life metrics were im-
proved in the AID group in this study (239).

Therefore, if the decision is made to use
AID systems without pregnancy-speciﬁc tar-
gets in selected pregnant individuals, then
using assistive techniques, such as the com-
bination of SAP mode (or manual mode)
and hybrid closed-loop mode at different
time points in pregnancy or throughout the
day or entering fake carbohydrate boluses,
should be considered and applied as needed
to achieve intended goals (240). See Section
15, “Diabetes and Pregnancy,” for more
details.

Insulin Pumps and Automated Insulin
Delivery Systems in People With Type 2
and Other Types of Diabetes
Traditional insulin pumps can be considered
for the treatment of people with type 2 dia-
betes who are on MDI as well as those who
have other types of diabetes resulting in in-
sulin deﬁciency, for instance, those who
have had a pancreatectomy and/or individ-
uals with cystic ﬁbrosis (241–245). Similar
to data on insulin pump use in people with
type 1 diabetes, reductions in A1C levels
have been reported in some studies
(243,246). More recently, real-world re-
ports have shown reduction of A1C levels
and reduction of total daily insulin dose
in individuals with type 2 diabetes initiat-
ing insulin pump therapy (247). Use of in-
sulin pumps in insulin-requiring people

with any type of diabetes may improve
user satisfaction and simplify therapy
(171,241).

For people with diabetes judged to be
clinically insulin deﬁcient who are treated
with an intensive insulin therapy, the pres-
ence or absence of measurable C-peptide
levels does not correlate with response to
therapy (171). A low C-peptide value should
not be required for insulin pump coverage
in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

The use of insulin pumps and AID sys-
tems in type 2 diabetes is still limited, and
at this time only one system is FDA ap-
proved for use in type 2 diabetes. Never-
theless, data are increasing; a small,
single-arm prospective study in adults
with type 2 diabetes who were on MDI
and started an AID system revealed im-
provement of TIR by 15% at 6 weeks (248).
Similar ﬁndings were reported in a ran-
domized controlled, crossover trial of
adults with type 2 diabetes previously
treated with conventional insulin pump
therapy plus CGM. While on the AID sys-
tem (5 weeks), the TIR increased by a
mean of 15%, with a decrease in TAR
(>180 mg/dL and >250 mg/dL) and
GMI. Of note, an increase in total daily in-
sulin dose was noted in the subjects
while on the AID system (249), whereas
other studies have shown either nonsig-
niﬁcant trends for a lower total daily
dose of insulin in the AID group (250) or
a reduction of total daily insulin in the
AID group previously using MDI (251). Fi-
nally, a recent RCT of older adults with
type 2 diabetes who used MDI but were
unable to manage insulin therapy on
their own revealed an increase of TIR of
27% over 12 weeks of AID system use in
addition to tailored home health care
services (250). Real-world studies have
also shown beneﬁts of these technolo-
gies in adults with type 2 diabetes
(235,251).

Alternative insulin delivery options in
people with type 2 diabetes include dispos-
able patch-like devices, which provide ei-
ther a continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusion of rapid-acting insulin (basal) with
bolus insulin in 2-unit increments at the
press of a button or bolus insulin only, deliv-
ered in 2-unit increments, used in conjunc-
tion with basal insulin injections (242,244,
252,253). Use of an insulin pump as a
means of insulin delivery is an individual
choice for people with diabetes and should
be considered an option in those who are
capable of safely using the device.

Open-Source Automated Insulin Dosing

Recommendation
7.29 Support and provide diabetes
management advice to people with
diabetes who choose to use an open-
source closed-loop system. B

Open-source automated insulin dosing
(OS-AID) algorithms provide the precise
code that governs their operation, so
health care professionals and people
with diabetes can have a more com-
plete understanding of risks and bene-
ﬁts (254). Any commercial entity could
provide the source code for their inter-
operable automated glycemic controller,
but most choose not to. OS-AID algo-
rithms are largely designed, maintained,
and curated by people with diabetes
and their loved ones. Thousands of peo-
ple with diabetes use these algorithms
with cleared CGM systems and insulin
pump components. The information on
how to set up and manage these sys-
tems is freely available online.

OS-AID is the preferred term when re-
ferring to any open-source system (com-
mercial or otherwise). It is important to
note that the term “DIY” is not reﬂective
of any aspect of these community-driven
systems. No individual person has written
all the code for these algorithms, and a
large percentage of users do not build
the software themselves (255). There are
two main available algorithms, the Open-
APS algorithm and the Loop algorithm,
which have been implemented on a vari-
ety of platforms.

The OpenAPS heuristic algorithm (im-
plemented on a system on a chip in
OpenAPS, Android smartphones as An-
droidAPS, and iPhone as iAPS/Trio) is
supported by large real-world studies
(256) and a multicenter RCT (257). The
OpenAPS algorithm is the only AID system
to support unannounced meals. In a single-
center study of adolescents with type 1
diabetes randomized to AndroidAPS with
quantitative carbohydrate announcements,
qualitative announcements, and no an-
nouncements, TIR was preserved across
groups (258).

Loop, an open-source model predic-
tive control algorithm, is implemented
on iPhones as an app. Prospective real-
world data from 558 adults and children
with type 1 diabetes on this system (255)
was used to support the FDA clearance
of a variant called Tidepool Loop (259).

S158 Diabetes Technology

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

Both the Loop and OpenAPS algorithms
offer direct management of algorithm ag-
gressiveness through conventional pump
settings. Therefore,
it is advisable that
health care professionals understand and
offer support in tuning settings for these
safe and effective technologies (254). This
may include, for example, the adjustment
of basal rates, insulin-to-carbohydrate ra-
tios, or insulin sensitivity factors. As with
any AID system, a backup insulin treatment
plan is advisable.

Digital Health Technology

Recommendation
7.30 Consider combining technology
(CGM, insulin pump, and/or diabetes
apps) with online or virtual coaching to
improve glycemic outcomes in individu-
als with diabetes or prediabetes. B

Increasingly, people are turning to the in-
ternet for advice, coaching, connection,
and health care. Diabetes, partly because
it is both common and numeric, lends itself
to the development of apps and online
programs. Recommendations for develop-
ing and implementing a digital diabetes
clinic have been published (260). The FDA
approves and monitors clinically validated,
digital, and usually online health technol-
ogies intended to treat a medical or psy-
chological condition; these are known as
digital therapeutics, or “digiceuticals” (fda.
gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-
excellence/device-software-functions-
including-mobile-medical-applications) (261).
Other applications, such as those that as-
sist in displaying or storing data, encourage
a healthy lifestyle or provide limited clinical
data support. Therefore, it is possible to
ﬁnd apps that have been fully reviewed
and approved by the FDA and others de-
signed and promoted by people with rela-
tively little skill or knowledge in the clinical
treatment of diabetes. There are insufﬁ-
cient data to provide recommendations
for speciﬁc apps for diabetes management,
education, and support in the absence of
RCTs and validation of apps unless they are
FDA cleared.

An area of particular importance is that
of online privacy and security. Established
cloud-based data aggregator programs,
such as Tidepool, Glooko, and others, have
been developed with appropriate data se-
curity features and are compliant with the
U.S. Health Insurance Portability and

Accountability Act of 1996. These pro-
grams can help monitor people with diabe-
tes and provide access to their health care
teams (262). Consumers should read the
policy regarding data privacy and sharing
before entering data into an application
and learn how they can manage the way
their data will be used (some programs of-
fer the ability to share more or less infor-
mation, such as being part of a registry or
data repository or not).

Many online programs offer lifestyle
counseling to achieve weight loss and
increased physical activity (263). Many
include a health coach and can create
small groups of similar participants on
social networks. Some programs aim to
treat prediabetes and prevent progres-
sion to diabetes, often following the
model of the Diabetes Prevention Program
(264,265). Others assist in improving dia-
betes outcomes by remotely monitoring
clinical data (for instance, wireless moni-
toring of glucose levels, weight, or blood
pressure) and providing feedback and
coaching (266–271). There are text mes-
saging approaches that tie into a variety of
different types of lifestyle and treatment
programs, which vary in terms of their ef-
fectiveness (272,273). There are limited
RCT data for many of these interventions,
and long-term follow-up is lacking. How-
ever, in a real-world observational study in
individuals with type 2 diabetes treated
with basal insulin, oral medications, or no
medications, the use of a digital health so-
lution and rtCGM resulted in reductions of
GMI and TAR >180 and >250 mg/dL as
well as an increase in TIR by 15% and par-
ticipation in a least one engagement activ-
ity per week (274). Therefore, even with
limited data, for an individual with diabe-
tes, opting in to one of these programs can
be helpful in providing support and, for
many, is an attractive option.

Inpatient Care

Recommendations
7.31 In people with diabetes wearing
personal CGM, the use of CGM should
be continued when clinically appropriate
during hospitalization, with conﬁrmatory
point-of-care glucose measurements for
insulin dosing and hypoglycemia assess-
ment and treatment under an institu-
tional protocol. B
7.32 Continue use of insulin pump or
AID in people with diabetes who are hos-
pitalized when clinically appropriate,

with conﬁrmatory point-of-care blood
glucose measurements for insulin dose
decisions and hypoglycemia assessment
and treatment. This is contingent upon
availability of necessary supplies, re-
sources, and training, ongoing compe-
tency assessments, and implementation
of institutional diabetes technology pro-
tocols. C

Individuals who are comfortable using
their diabetes devices, such as insulin
pumps and CGM, should be allowed to
use them in an inpatient setting if they
are well enough to take care of the de-
vices and have brought the necessary
supplies (273,275–278). People with di-
abetes who are familiar with treating
their own glucose levels can often ad-
just insulin doses more knowledgeably
than inpatient staff who do not person-
ally know the individual or their manage-
ment style. It is crucial that, when people
with diabetes in the inpatient setting need
to temporarily disconnect or interrupt
their device use for a procedure or imaging
studies, etc., the care team is particularly
careful to not discard these devices or stop
their use without ensuring that an alter-
nate method of insulin delivery has been
initiated, if these are insulin delivery de-
vices, and to ensure that close glucose
monitoring is continued by ﬁnger stick.
Therefore, it is particularly important that
the use of diabetes devices while in the in-
patient setting should occur based on the
hospital’s policies for diabetes manage-
ment and use of diabetes technology, and
there should be supervision to ensure that
the individual is achieving and maintaining
glycemic goals during acute illness in a hos-
pitalized setting where factors such as infec-
tion, certain medications, immobility, and
changes in nutrition can affect insulin sensi-
tivity and the insulin response (279–281).

With the advent of the coronavirus
disease 2019 pandemic, the FDA exer-
cised enforcement discretion by allowing
CGM device use temporarily in the hospi-
tal for patient monitoring (282). This ap-
proach has been taken to reduce the use
of personal protective equipment and
more closely monitor patients so that
health care personnel do not have to go
into a patient room solely to measure a
glucose level (283–286). Studies have
been published assessing the effective-
ness of this approach, which may ulti-
mately lead to the approved use of CGM

for monitoring hospitalized individuals
(277,286–295). When used in the setting
of a clinical trial or when clinical circum-
stances (such as during a shortage of per-
sonal protective equipment) require it,
CGM can be used to manage hospitalized
individuals in conjunction with BGM. Point-
of-care BGM remains the approved
method for glucose monitoring in hos-
pitals, especially for dosing insulin and
treating hypoglycemia. Similarly, data
are emerging on the inpatient use of AID
systems and their challenges (277,296,
297). For more information, see Section
16, “Diabetes Care in the Hospital.”

The Future
The pace of development in diabetes
technology is extremely rapid. New ap-
proaches and tools are available each
year. It is difﬁcult for research to keep up
with these advances, because newer ver-
sions of the devices and digital solutions
are already on the market by the time a
study is completed. The most important
component in all these systems is the
person with diabetes. Technology selec-
tion must be appropriate for the individ-
ual. Simply having a device or application
does not change outcomes unless the hu-
man being engages with it to create posi-
tive health beneﬁts. This underscores the
need for the health care team to assist
people with diabetes in device and pro-
gram selection and to support their use
through ongoing education and training.
Expectations must be tempered by real-
ity—we do not yet have technology that
completely eliminates the self-care tasks
necessary for managing diabetes, but the
tools described in this section can make it
easier to manage.
