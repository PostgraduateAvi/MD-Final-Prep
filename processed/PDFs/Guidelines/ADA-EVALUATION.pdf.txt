The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes
the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the
components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to
evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an
interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of
Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA
standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for
ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Com-
mittee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish
to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes

PERSON-CENTERED COLLABORATIVE CARE

Recommendations
4.1 A communication style that uses person-centered, culturally sensitive, and
strength-based language and active listening; elicits individual preferences and
beliefs; and assesses literacy, numeracy, and potential barriers to care should be
used to optimize health outcomes and health-related quality of life. B
4.2 People with diabetes can beneﬁt from a coordinated interprofessional
team that may include but is not limited to diabetes care and education spe-
cialists, primary care and subspecialty clinicians, nurses, registered dietitian
nutritionists, exercise specialists, pharmacists, dentists, podiatrists, and behav-
ioral health professionals. C

A successful medical evaluation depends on beneﬁcial interactions and care coor-
dination between the person with diabetes and the care team (1). The Chronic
Care Model (2–4) (see Section 1, “Improving Care and Promoting Health in
Populations”) is a person-centered approach to care that requires a close working
relationship between the person with diabetes and clinicians involved in treat-
ment planning. People with diabetes should receive health care from a coordi-
nated interprofessional team that may include but is not limited to diabetes care
and education specialists, primary care and subspecialty clinicians, nurses, regis-
tered dietitian nutritionists, exercise specialists, pharmacists, dentists, podiatrists,
behavioral health professionals, and community partners such as community
health workers and community paramedics. Individuals with diabetes and their
care partners must assume an active role in their care. Based on the preferences
and values of the person with diabetes, elicited by the care team, the person with
diabetes, their family or support group, and the health care team together formu-
late the management plan, which includes lifestyle management (see Section 5,

Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

“Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors
and Well-being to Improve Health
Outcomes”) and pharmacotherapy, as
appropriate.

The goals of treatment for diabetes
are to prevent or delay complications
and optimize quality of life (Fig. 4.1).
Treatment goals and plans should be co-
created by the care team and people
with diabetes based on their individual
preferences, values, and goals. This indi-
vidualized management plan should take
into account the person’s age, cognitive
abilities, school/work schedule and condi-
tions, health beliefs, support systems, eating
patterns, physical activity, social situation, ﬁ-
nancial concerns, cultural factors, literacy
and numeracy (mathematical literacy), dia-
betes history (duration, complications, and
current use of medications), comorbidities,
disabilities, health priorities, other medical
conditions, preferences for care, access to
health care services, and life expectancy.
People living with diabetes should be en-
gaged in conversation about these aspects
of their lives and diabetes management,

with routine reassessment as necessary
given their changing circumstances across
the life span. Various strategies and techni-
ques should be used to support the person’s
self-management efforts, including pro-
viding education on problem-solving and
coping skills for all aspects of diabetes
management.

Communication by health care professio-
nals with people with diabetes and their
families should acknowledge that multiple
factors impact glycemic management but
also emphasize that collaboratively devel-
oped treatment plans and a healthy lifestyle
can signiﬁcantly improve disease outcomes
and well-being (5–10). Thus, the goal of
communication between health care pro-
fessionals and people with diabetes is to es-
tablish a collaborative relationship and to
assess and address self-management bar-
riers without blaming people with diabetes
for “noncompliance” or “nonadherence”
when the outcomes of self-management
are not optimal (11). The familiar terms
noncompliance and nonadherence denote
a passive, obedient role for a person with

diabetes in “following doctor’s orders,”
which is at odds with the active role peo-
ple with diabetes take in the day-to-day
decision-making, planning, monitoring,
evaluation, and problem-solving involved
in diabetes self-management. Using a
nonjudgmental approach that normal-
izes periodic lapses in management may
help minimize the person’s resistance to
reporting problems with self-management.
Empathizing and using active listening tech-
niques, such as open-ended questions, re-
ﬂective statements, and summarizing what
the person said, can help facilitate commu-
nication. Perceptions of people with diabe-
tes about their own ability, or self-efﬁcacy,
to self-manage diabetes constitute one
important psychosocial factor related to
improved diabetes self-management and
treatment outcomes in diabetes (12–14)
and should be a goal of ongoing assess-
ment, education, and treatment planning.
Language has a strong impact on per-
ceptions and behavior. Empowering lan-
guage can help to inform and motivate,
while shame and judgement can be

Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities

discouraging. The American Diabetes Associ-
ation (ADA) and the Association of Diabetes
Care & Education Specialists (ADCES) (for-
merly called the American Association of Di-
abetes Educators) joint consensus report,
“The Use of Language in Diabetes Care and
Education,” provides the authors’ expert
opinion regarding the use of language by
health care professionals when speaking or
writing about diabetes for people with di-
abetes or for professional audiences (15).
Although further research is needed to
address the impact of language on diabe-
tes outcomes, the report includes ﬁve
key consensus recommendations for lan-
guage use:

(cid:129) Use language that is neutral, non-
judgmental, and based on facts, ac-
tions, physiology, or biology.
(cid:129) Use language free from stigma.
(cid:129) Use language that is strength based,
respectful, and inclusive and that
imparts hope.

(cid:129) Use language that fosters collabora-
tion between people with diabetes
and health care professionals.

(cid:129) Use language that is person cen-
tered (e.g., “person with diabetes” is
preferred over “diabetic”).

COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL
EVALUATION

Recommendations
4.3 A complete medical evaluation
should be performed at the initial visit
and follow-up, as appropriate, to:
(cid:129) Conﬁrm the diagnosis and classify

diabetes. A

(cid:129) Assess glycemic status and previ-

ous treatment. A

(cid:129) Evaluate for diabetes complications,
potential comorbid conditions, and
overall health status. A

(cid:129) Identify care partners and sup-

port system. E

(cid:129) Assess social determinants of health
and structural barriers to optimal
health and health care. A

(cid:129) Review risk factor management
in the person with diabetes. A
(cid:129) Begin engagement with the person
with diabetes in the formulation of
a care management plan including
initial goals of care. A

(cid:129) Develop a plan for continuing

care. A

4.4 Ongoing management should be
guided by the assessment of overall

health and functional status, diabetes
complications, cardiovascular risk, hy-
poglycemia risk, and shared decision-
making to set therapeutic goals. B

The comprehensive medical evaluation
includes the initial and follow-up evalua-
tions, which comprise assessment of
complications, psychosocial assessment,
management of comorbid conditions, over-
all health, functional and cognitive status,
and engagement of the person with diabe-
tes throughout the process. While a com-
prehensive list is provided in Table 4.1, in
clinical practice the health care professional
may need to prioritize the components of
the medical evaluation given the available
resources and time. Engaging other mem-
bers of the health care team can also sup-
port comprehensive diabetes care. The goal
of these recommendations is to provide
the health care team information so it can
optimally support people with diabetes and
their care partners.
In addition to the
medical history, physical examination, and
laboratory tests, health care professionals
should assess diabetes self-management
behaviors, nutrition, social determinants
of health, and psychosocial health (see
Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health
Behaviors and Well-being to Improve
Health Outcomes”) and give guidance on
routine immunizations. The assessment of
sleep pattern and duration should also be
considered, as this may affect glycemic
management.
follow-up visits
Interval
should occur at least every 3–6 months in-
dividualized to the person and then at
least annually.

Lifestyle management and behavioral
health care are cornerstones of diabetes
management. People with diabetes should
be referred for diabetes self-management
education and support, medical nutrition
therapy, and assessment of behavioral
health concerns as appropriate. People
with diabetes should receive recom-
mended preventive care services (e.g., im-
munizations and age- and sex-appropriate
cancer screening); smoking cessation
counseling; and ophthalmological, den-
tal, podiatric, and other referrals, as
needed.

The assessment of risk of acute and
chronic diabetes complications and treat-
ment planning are key components of ini-
tial and follow-up visits (Table 4.2). The
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-
ease and heart failure (see Section 10,

“Cardiovascular Disease
and Risk
Management”), chronic kidney disease
(CKD) staging (see Section 11, “Chronic
Kidney Disease and Risk Management”),
presence of retinopathy and neuropathy
(see Section 12, “Retinopathy, Neuro-
pathy, and Foot Care”), and risk of treat-
ment-associated hypoglycemia should be
used to individualize goals for glycemia (see
Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hypo-
glycemia”), blood pressure, and lipids and
to select speciﬁc glucose-lowering medica-
tion(s) (see Section 9, “Pharmacologic
Approaches to Glycemic Treatment”),
antihypertension medications, and lipid-
lowering treatment intensity.

Additional referrals should be arranged
as necessary (Table 4.2). Clinicians should
ensure that people with diabetes are ap-
propriately screened for complications,
comorbidities, and treatment burden. Dis-
cussing and implementing an approach to
glycemic management with the person is
a part, not the sole goal, of the clinical
encounter.

IMMUNIZATIONS

Recommendation
4.5 Provide routinely recommended
vaccinations for children and adults
with diabetes as indicated by age
(see Table 4.3). A

Children and adults with diabetes should
receive vaccinations according to age-
appropriate recommendations (16,17).
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) provides vaccination sched-
ules speciﬁcally for children, adolescents,
and adults with diabetes (cdc.gov/
vaccines/). The CDC Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) makes
recommendations based on its own review
and rating of the evidence, provided in
Table 4.3 for selected vaccinations. The
ACIP evidence review has evolved over
time with the adoption of Grading of Rec-
ommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) in 2010 and then
the Evidence to Decision or Evidence to
Recommendation frameworks in 2020 (18).
Here, we discuss the particular importance
of speciﬁc vaccines.

tions, including diabetes, are more likely

disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 vac-
cination using an appropriate number
of doses of updated vaccines is recom-
mended for everyone aged 6 months
and older in the U.S. (18).

Hepatitis B
Compared with the general population,
people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
have higher rates of hepatitis. Because of
the higher likelihood of transmission of
the disease, hepatitis B vaccine is recom-
mended for adults with diabetes aged
<60 years. For adults aged $60 years,
hepatitis B vaccine may be administered
at the discretion of the treating clinician
based on the person’s likelihood of ac-
quiring hepatitis B infection (19).

Influenza
Inﬂuenza is a common, preventable infec-
tious disease associated with high mortality
and morbidity in vulnerable populations,
including youth, older adults, and people
with chronic diseases. Inﬂuenza vaccination
in people with diabetes has been found to
signiﬁcantly reduce inﬂuenza and diabetes-
related hospital admissions (20). In people
with diabetes, the inﬂuenza vaccine has
been associated with lower risk of all-cause
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and car-
diovascular events (21). Given the beneﬁts
of the annual inﬂuenza vaccination, it is rec-
ommended for all individuals $6 months
of age who do not have a contraindication.
The live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine, which
is delivered by nasal spray, is an option for
people who are 2–49 years of age and are
not pregnant, but people with chronic con-
ditions such as diabetes are cautioned
against taking the live attenuated inﬂuenza
vaccine and are instead recommended to
receive the inactive or recombinant inﬂu-
enza vaccination. As of the 2024–2025 sea-
son, all inﬂuenza vaccines offered in the
U.S. are trivalent (22).

Pneumococcal Pneumonia
Like inﬂuenza, pneumococcal pneumonia
is a common, preventable disease. People
with diabetes are at increased risk for
pneumococcal infection and have been re-
ported to have a high risk of hospitalization
and death, with a mortality rate as high as
50% (23). All people with diabetes should
receive one of the CDC-recommended
pneumococcal vaccines (24). See details in
Table 4.3.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause
of respiratory illness in some individuals,
including older adults. People with chronic
conditions such as diabetes have a higher
risk of severe illness. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved the
ﬁrst vaccines for prevention of RSV-associ-
ated lower respiratory tract disease in
adults aged $60 years. On 26 June 2024,
ACIP voted to recommend that all adults
aged $75 years and adults aged 60–74
years who are at increased risk for severe
RSV should receive a single dose of RSV
vaccine (25).

ASSESSMENT OF COMORBIDITIES
Besides assessing diabetes-related compli-
cations, clinicians and people with diabetes
need to be aware of common comorbid-
ities that affect people with diabetes and
that may complicate management (26–28).
Diabetes comorbidities are conditions that
affect people with diabetes more often
than age-matched people without diabe-
tes. This section discusses many of the
common comorbidities observed in people
with diabetes but is not necessarily inclu-
sive of all the conditions that have been
reported.

Autoimmune Diseases

Recommendations
4.6 Screen people with type 1 diabe-
tes for autoimmune thyroid disease
soon after diagnosis and thereafter
at repeated intervals if clinically indi-
cated. B
4.7 Adults with type 1 diabetes should
be screened for celiac disease in the
presence of gastrointestinal symptoms,
signs, laboratory manifestations, or clin-
ical suspicion suggestive of celiac dis-
ease. B

People with type 1 diabetes are at in-
creased risk for other autoimmune dis-
eases, with thyroid disease, celiac disease,
and pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deﬁ-
ciency) being among the most common
(29). Other autoimmune conditions asso-
ciated with type 1 diabetes include auto-
immune liver disease, primary adrenal
insufﬁciency (Addison disease), vitiligo,
collagen vascular diseases, and myasthe-
nia gravis (30–33). Type 1 diabetes may
also occur with other autoimmune dis-
eases in the context of speciﬁc genetic

disorders such as polyglandular autoim-
mune syndromes (34). Given the high
prevalence, nonspeciﬁc symptoms, and in-
sidious onset of primary hypothyroidism,
routine screening for thyroid dysfunction
is recommended for all people with type 1
diabetes. Screening for celiac disease
should be considered in adults with dia-
betes with suggestive symptoms (e.g.,
diarrhea, malabsorption, and abdominal
pain) or signs (e.g., osteoporosis, vitamin
deﬁciencies, and iron deﬁciency anemia)
(35,36). Measurement of vitamin B12 lev-
els should be considered for people with
type 1 diabetes and peripheral neuropa-
thy or unexplained anemia.

Bone Health

Recommendations
4.8 Assess fracture risk in older adults
with diabetes as a part of routine care
in diabetes clinical practice, according
to risk factors and comorbidities. A
4.9 Monitor bone mineral density us-
ing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
in older adults with diabetes (aged
$65 years) and younger individuals
with diabetes and multiple risk factors
every 2–3 years (Table 4.4). A
4.10 Consider the potential adverse
impact on skeletal health when se-
lecting pharmacological options to
lower glucose levels in people with
diabetes. Avoiding medications with

a known association with higher
fracture risk (e.g., thiazolidinediones
and sulfonylureas) is recommended,
particularly for those at elevated
risk for fractures. B
4.11 To reduce the risk of falls and
fractures, glycemic management goals
should be individualized for people
with diabetes at a higher risk of fracture.
C Prioritize use of glucose-lowering
medications that are associated with
low risk for hypoglycemia to avoid
falls. B
4.12 Advise people with diabetes
on their intake of calcium (1,000–
1,200 mg/day) and vitamin D to en-
sure it meets the recommended
daily allowance for those at risk for
fracture, either through their diet or
supplemental means. B
4.13 Antiresorptive medications and
osteoanabolic agents should be recom-
mended for older adults with diabetes
who are at higher risk of fracture, in-
cluding those with low bone mineral
density with a T-score #(cid:3)2.0, history
of fragility fracture, or elevated Frac-
ture Risk Assessment Tool score ($3%
for hip fracture or $20% for major os-
teoporotic fracture). B

Determination of fracture risk traditionally
has relied on measurements of bone min-
eral density (BMD) and the World Health

Organization–deﬁned T-score of #–2.5 SD.
However, it is now established that the
consideration of other risk factors im-
proves the categorization of fracture risk
(Table 4.4). There are factors beyond
BMD that contribute to bone strength in
people with diabetes.

A low-trauma hip/pelvis, vertebral, or
forearm fracture in people aged $65 years
is diagnostic for osteoporosis independent
of BMD and is one of the strongest risk
factors for subsequent fractures, especially
in the ﬁrst 1–2 years after a fracture
(37,38). Osteoporotic hip fractures are as-
sociated with signiﬁcant morbidity, mortal-
ity, and societal costs (39). It is estimated
that 20% of individuals do not survive to 1
year after hip fracture, while 60% do not
regain their prior functionality, living with
permanent disability (40).

Hip fractures in people with diabetes
are associated with higher risk of mor-
tality (28% in women and 57% in men),
longer recovery, and delayed healing
(41) compared with individuals without
diabetes.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors
Age-speciﬁc fracture risk is signiﬁcantly
increased in people with type 1 or type 2
diabetes in both sexes, with a 34% in-
crease in fracture risk compared with
those without diabetes (42).

Type 1 Diabetes. Fracture risk in people
with type 1 diabetes is increased by 4.35
times for hip fractures, 1.83 times for up-
per limb fractures, and 1.97 times for an-
kle fractures (43). Fractures occur even
at young ages, 10–15 years earlier than
they do in people without diabetes, and
are less frequent at the vertebral level.
Type 1 diabetes is often associated with
low bone mass, although BMD underes-
timates the high risk of fracture observed
in young individuals (43). Risk of fracture is
increased in people with type 1 diabetes
with microvascular complications or neurop-
athy (41). Moreover, average A1C >7.9%
(risk ratio [RR] 3.57 [CI 1.08–11.78]), dura-
tion of diabetes >26 years (RR 7.6 [CI
1.67–34.6]), and family history of fractures
(RR 2.64 [CI 1.15–6.09]) have been inde-
pendently associated with high risk of non-
vertebral fractures (44).

Type 2 Diabetes. In people with type 2 di-
abetes, even with normal or higher BMD,
hip fracture risk is increased by 1.79
times, and risk throughout life is 40–70%

higher than in it is in individuals without
diabetes (42,45–47). According to a meta-
analysis that included 15 studies, people
with type 2 diabetes had a 35% higher in-
cidence of vertebral fractures, causing in-
creased risk of mortality (HR 2.11 [95% CI
1.72–2.59]) (48). Fracture risk is also in-
creased in the upper limbs and ankle.
However, bone loss is accelerated, and
low BMD remains an independent risk
factor for fractures (49,50).

Glycemic management signiﬁcantly im-
pacts fracture risk in people with diabetes.
A meta-analysis revealed an 8% increased
fracture risk per 1% rise in A1C level (RR
1.08 [95% CI 1.03–1.14]) (51). Poor glyce-
mic management (A1C >9%) over 2 years
in individuals with type 2 diabetes corre-
lated with a 29% heightened fracture risk
(52). Notably, this risk was higher among
White individuals than in other racial
groups. Hypoglycemia also escalated the
risk of fractures at the hip and other

skeletal sites (RR 1.52 [95% CI 1.23–1.88])
(51). A Japanese study echoed these ﬁnd-
ings, showing a fracture risk increase (haz-
ard ratio [HR] 2.24 [95% CI 1.56–3.21])
with severe hypoglycemia episodes (53).

Longer disease duration further ele-
vates fracture risk (54); data indicate indi-
viduals who have had type 2 diabetes for
>10 years face signiﬁcantly higher frac-
ture risks, which are largely attributed to
ensuing microvascular and macrovascular
damage affecting the skeleton. Additionally,
high fracture risk is seen in people with
cardiovascular disease (CVD), nephropathy,
retinopathy, neuropathy, poor physical
function, and frequent falls (55–57).

Certain glucose-lowering medications
also factor into fracture risk. Studies have
reported increased fracture incidences in
women using thiazolidinediones (TZD),
with the risk doubling with 1–2 years of
TZD use compared with placebo or other
glucose-lowering medications (HR 2.23

[95% CI 1.65–3.01]) (58,59). According to
the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk
in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, reduced risk
is noted in women who had discontinued
TZD use for 1–2 years (HR 0.57 [95% CI
0.35–0.92]) or >2 years (HR 0.42 [95% CI
0.24–0.74]) compared with current users
(60). Furthermore, individuals with type 2
diabetes on insulin (RR 1.49 [95% CI
1.29–1.73]) or sulfonylurea (RR 1.30
[95% CI 1.18–1.43]) treatment exhibit a
heightened fracture risk (61).

Screening
Most evidence on screening in individuals
at risk for fracture is available from peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes; fracture risk
prediction using BMD in type 1 diabetes
has not been extensively studied. Health
care professionals should assess fracture
history and risk factors in people with di-
abetes and recommend measurement of
BMD if appropriate according to the indi-
vidual’s age and sex.

Type 2 Diabetes. People with type 2 diabe-
tes have 5–10% higher BMD than people
without diabetes, although they present
with lower bone strength, impaired bone
microarchitecture, and accelerated bone
loss (49,62–64). A T-score adjustment of
(cid:3)0.5 has been proposed to improve frac-
ture prediction by dual-energy X-ray ab-
sorptiometry (DXA). For example, a T-score
#–2.0 should be interpreted as equivalent
to –2.5 in a person without diabetes (50).
Notably, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool
(FRAX), although useful, does not factor in
type 2 diabetes; an inclusion of the condi-
tion is estimated to mirror the effect of ei-
ther a 10-year age increase or a 0.5 SD
reduction in BMD T-score (65). Fracture
risk was higher in large observational stud-
ies in participants with diabetes compared
with those without diabetes for a given
T-score and age or for a given FRAX score
(50). One method to potentially improve
fracture risk prediction for people with
type 2 diabetes involves using the FRAX
“rheumatoid arthritis” input as a proxy for
diabetes risk (66,67). Additionally, perfor-
mance of FRAX can be improved by using
1) trabecular bone score adjustment, 2)
lowering femoral neck T-score input by
0.5 SD, or 3) increasing the age by 10
years (66). Growing evidence suggests
that fracture risk prediction is enhanced
by use of trabecular bone score (65,66),
although such studies are not available for

individuals with type 1 diabetes and are
based on data from the U.S. or Canada.

In people with type 2 diabetes, BMD
should be monitored by DXA scan in
older adults (aged $65 years) in the
absence of other comorbidities and in
younger individuals (>50 years of age)
with bone or diabetes-related risk factors,
such as insulin use or diabetes duration
>10 years (Table 4.4). Reassessment is
recommended every 2–3 years (65),
depending on the screening evaluation
and the presence of additional risk fac-
tors, although the evidence on how fre-
quently DXA should be repeated is less
robust. According to the European Asso-
ciation for the Study of Obesity (EASO),
DXA should be performed every 2 years
in subjects undergoing bariatric-metabolic
surgery.

DXA-assisted vertebral fracture assess-
ment is a convenient and low-cost method
to assess vertebral fractures, although tradi-
tional lateral thoracic/lumbar spine X-ray is
still considered the gold standard (68). MRI
or computed tomography imaging studies
performed for other purposes should be
analyzed for presence of vertebral frac-
tures as well as chest X-rays in hospital-
ized individuals. Bone turnover markers

are commonly used in clinical practice to
monitor bone formation and bone re-
sorption, although they are suppressed
in people with diabetes and have not
been shown to predict fracture risk (69).

Type 1 Diabetes. Because hip fracture
risk in type 1 diabetes starts to increase
after the age of 50, clinicians may consider
assessing BMD after the 5th decade of
life (43). In people with type 1 diabetes,
BMD underestimates fracture risk, but
studies do not address the extent of un-
derestimation of fracture risk.

According to the International Society
for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes
(ISPAD), regular assessment of bone health
using bone densitometry in youth with
type 1 diabetes is still controversial and not
recommended, but it may be considered in
association with celiac disease (70).

Management
Appropriate glycemic management and
minimizing hypoglycemic episodes are cru-
cial for bone health in people with diabe-
tes.
Individuals with prolonged disease,
microvascular and macrovascular complica-
tions, or frequent hypoglycemic episodes
face higher fracture risks and fall risks due

to factors like poor vision, neuropathy, sar-
copenia, and impaired gait. Health care
professionals should advocate moderate
physical activity to enhance muscle health,
gait coordination, and balance as part of
fracture preventive strategies (56,57,71).

Aerobic and weight-bearing exercise
should be recommended to counteract
the potential negative effect of weight
loss on bone; speciﬁc guidelines have
been published for older adults with
type 2 diabetes (72).

Osteoporosis and fracture prevention
are ﬁrst based on measures applied to
the general population. All people with
diabetes should receive an adequate daily
intake of proteins, calcium, and vitamin D,
stop smoking, and have regular physical
activity (73–75).

Intake of calcium should reﬂect the
age-speciﬁc recommendations for the
general population and should be ob-
tained through diet and/or oral supple-
ments (76).

The optimal

level of 25-hydroxyvita-
min D is a matter of controversy (77),
although serum levels 20–30 ng/mL are
generally thought to be sufﬁcient (78).

The safe upper limit is also a matter of
debate, and there is substantial disagree-
ment over whether to treat to a speciﬁed
serum level. In the U.S., the recommended
daily allowance of vitamin D is 600 IU for
people aged 51–70 years and 800 IU for
people aged >70 years (78). In clinical
practice, this dose of supplement may not
be sufﬁcient to reach recommended se-
rum levels of vitamin D, particularly in
those at risk for vitamin D deﬁciency, and
therefore supplementation should be
individualized.

Fractures are important determinants
of frailty, a predisability condition that
should be mitigated with individualized

interventions to prevent falls, maintain
mobility, and delay disability (72). In many
circumstances, conservative management
(calcium, vitamin D, and lifestyle meas-
ures) are not enough to reduce fracture
risk. When pharmacological treatment is
needed, treatment initiation strategies are
the same as those used for the general
population. Antiosteoporosis medications
reduce bone resorption (bisphosphonates,
selective estrogen receptor modulators,
and denosumab), stimulate bone forma-
tion (teriparatide and abaloparatide), or
have dual actions by stimulating bone
formation and reducing bone resorption
(romosozumab). These agents improve
bone density and reduce the risk of ver-
tebral and nonvertebral fractures. Al-
though there are no studies speciﬁcally
designed for people with diabetes, data on
antiresorptive and osteoanabolic agents
suggest efﬁcacy in type 2 diabetes is similar
to that for individuals without diabetes
(79–81). Using individual participant data
from randomized trials, antiresorptive ther-
apies show similar effects in people with
and without type 2 diabetes for vertebral,
hip, and nonvertebral fractures (79). No
similar studies of efﬁcacy of antiosteoporo-
sis treatment in people with type 1 diabe-
tes have been published.

Primary Prevention of Fragility Fractures
in People With Diabetes. In the general
population, a T-score #–2.5 is the thresh-
old to consider pharmacological treatment
for osteoporosis. In type 2 diabetes, since
T-score underestimates fracture risk (as
discussed above), a T-score #–2.0 may be
more appropriate for considering initiation
of a ﬁrst-line drug, including bisphospho-
nates (alendronate, risedronate, and zole-
dronic acid) or denosumab.

Denosumab is preferred in individuals
with estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
<30–35 mL/min/1.73 m2, although the
FDA has recently issued a boxed warning
for increased risk of severe hypocalcemia
in individuals with advanced chronic kid-
ney disease. Self-management abilities of
the person with diabetes should be con-
sidered in medication selection, recom-
mending strict medication-taking behavior,
as there can be rebound bone loss causing
multiple vertebral fractures with missed
doses of denosumab or delays in care.
Bisphosphonate therapy (oral or intrave-
nous) may be more appropriate in individ-
uals with poor medication-taking behavior
or gaps in access to medical care.

There are some additional considera-
tions related to medication selection in
people with diabetes. Data from a phase 3
trial, Future Revascularization Evaluation
in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Opti-
mal Management of Multivessel Disease
(FREEDOM), and its 10-year extension
have shown that people with diabetes
treated with denosumab experienced pos-
itive effects on fasting glucose (82) and sig-
niﬁcant improvements in BMD and lower
vertebral fracture risk (67). However, ac-
cording to a post hoc subgroup analysis, a
higher risk of nonvertebral fractures was
observed in people with diabetes treated
with denosumab (67). Romosozumab re-
ceived FDA approval with a box warning
because it may increase risk of myocardial
infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death
and should not be prescribed in women
who experienced a myocardial infarction
or a stroke within the past year (83,84).

Secondary Prevention of Fragility Frac-
tures. The risk of subsequent fracture in
individuals with hip or vertebral fracture
is high, especially in the ﬁrst 1–2 years
after a fracture. Antiosteoporosis treat-
ment reduces the risk of fracture in older
individuals with prior hip or vertebral
fracture.

As in the general population, people
with diabetes who experience fragility
fracture should 1) be given the diagnosis
of osteoporosis regardless of DXA data
and 2) receive the appropriate work-up
and therapy to prevent future fractures
(85). Individuals on long-term treatment
with antiosteoporosis medications, with
multiple fragility fractures, or with multi-
ple comorbidities should be referred to a
bone metabolic specialist. In these more
complicated cases, a bone specialist may
choose to initiate an osteoanabolic agent
to optimize bone formation and reduce
immediate fracture risk (86). It is strongly
recommended that all individuals with a
fragility fracture be started on antiosteo-
porosis therapy and adequate calcium
and vitamin D supplementation (if re-
quired) as soon as possible. In the appro-
priate individual, therapy may even be
initiated during an inpatient stay to re-
duce care delays (85).

bone metabolism. Medications other than
TZDs are advisable for postmenopausal
women or older men with type 2 diabetes
due to their safer bone health proﬁles.
While several studies have shown metfor-
min to have a safe proﬁle, special atten-
tion should be paid to the wide use of
sulfonylureas because of the high risk of
hypoglycemic events leading to falls and
fractures (87). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 in-
hibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 re-
ceptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been
used in clinical practice for more than
15 years, and both clinical trials and
postmarketing data suggest a neutral im-
pact on bone health (88,89). Tirzepatide
may play a positive effect through glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)
receptor agonism, preventing bone loss as-
sociated with weight loss (90), although
bone outcomes have not yet been reported
in clinical data.

Use of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitors has raised some con-
cerns. The Canagliﬂozin Cardiovascular As-
sessment Study (CANVAS) study showed
that the proportion of subjects with frac-
ture was higher in the canagliﬂozin groups
than the noncanagliﬂozin groups (2.7% vs.
1.9%, respectively). Further analyses from
the same trial and from the Canagliﬂozin
and Renal Events in Diabetes with Estab-
lished Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation
(CREDENCE) study found a neutral effect
on fracture risk (91–94). Although few
data are available, use of empagliﬂozin,
ertugliﬂozin, or dapagliﬂozin has not been
associated with negative effects on bone
health (93–95). Use of insulin has been
shown to be associated with a doubling of
the risk of hip fractures (87), likely because
of higher risk of hypoglycemia, longer du-
ration of the disease, and comorbidities
that may contribute to diminished bone
strength.

In conclusion, glucose-lowering medica-
tions with a good bone safety proﬁle are
preferred. This is especially true in older
adults, in people with longer duration of
disease, or in people with complications.
Aggressive therapeutic approaches should
be avoided in those who are frail and in
older adults to prevent hypoglycemic
events and falls.

and bladder (96). The association may
result from shared risk factors between
type 2 diabetes and cancer (older age,
obesity, and physical inactivity) but may
also be due to diabetes-related factors
(97), such as underlying disease physiol-
ogy or diabetes treatments, although evi-
dence for these links is scarce. People
with diabetes should be encouraged
to undergo recommended age-and sex-
appropriate cancer screenings, coordinated
with their primary health care professional,
and to reduce their modiﬁable cancer
inactivity,
risk factors (obesity, physical
and smoking). New onset of atypical dia-
betes (lean body habitus and negative
family history) in a middle-aged or older
person may precede the diagnosis of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (98). Addi-
tionally, in a nationwide cancer registry in
New Zealand, postpancreatitis diabetes
mellitus was associated with signiﬁcantly
higher risk (2.4-fold) of pancreatic cancer
compared with pancreatitis after type 2
diabetes (99). However, in the absence
of other symptoms (e.g., weight loss and
abdominal pain), routine screening for
pancreatic cancer is not currently recom-
mended. Metformin and sulfonylureas
may have anticancer properties. Data for
pioglitazone are mixed, with a previous
concern for bladder cancer association.
Recommendations cannot be made at
this time (100–102). Thus far, the use of
GLP-1 RAs has not been shown to be as-
sociated with the incidence of thyroid
cancer, pancreatic cancer, or any other
type of cancer in humans (103).

Cognitive Impairment/Dementia

Recommendation
4.14 In the presence of cognitive im-
pairment, diabetes treatment plans
should be simpliﬁed as much as pos-
sible and tailored to minimize the
risk of hypoglycemia. B

Diabetes is associated with a signiﬁcantly
increased risk and rate of cognitive de-
cline and an increased risk of dementia
(104). A meta-analysis of prospective ob-
servational studies found that individuals
with diabetes had a 43% higher risk of all
types of dementia, a 43% higher risk of
Alzheimer dementia, and a 91% higher
risk of vascular dementia compared with
individuals without diabetes (104). The re-
verse is also true: people with Alzheimer
dementia are more likely to develop

diabetes than people without Alzheimer
dementia. In a 15-year prospective study
of community-dwelling people >60 years
of age, the presence of diabetes at base-
line signiﬁcantly increased the age-and
sex-adjusted incidence of all-cause demen-
tia, Alzheimer dementia, and vascular de-
mentia compared with rates in those with
normal glucose tolerance (105). A new
clinical entity of diabetes-related dementia
is being recognized as distinct
from
Alzheimer dementia or vascular dementia.
It is characterized by slow progression of
dementia, absence of typical neuroimag-
ing ﬁndings seen in Alzheimer or vascu-
lar dementia, old age, high A1C levels,
long duration of diabetes, high fre-
quency of insulin use, frailty, and sarco-
penia or dynapenia (106). See Section
13, “Older Adults,” for a more detailed
discussion regarding assessment of
cognitive impairment.

Glycemic Status and Cognition
In individuals with diabetes, higher A1C
level
is associated with lower cognitive
function (107). A meta-analysis of ran-
domized trials found that intensive glyce-
mic management, compared with higher
A1C goals, was associated with a slightly
lower rate of cognitive decline (108). How-
ever, these ﬁndings were driven by an
older study with an A1C goal of <7.0% in
the intensive treatment arm. Analyses
within the ACCORD, Action in Diabetes and
Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron
MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), and
Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) studies
found that intensive glycemic management
(A1C goal of <6.0–6.5%) resulted in no dif-
ferences in cognitive outcomes compared
with standard control (108–110). Therefore,
intensive glycemic management should not
be advised for the improvement of cogni-
tive function in individuals with type 2
diabetes. Additionally, people with type 2
diabetes and dementia are at heightened
risk for experiencing hyperglycemic crises
(diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar state) compared with people
without dementia (111), underscoring the
importance of supporting diabetes man-
agement for individuals experiencing cogni-
tive decline and diminished capacity for
self-care. In addition, these individuals have
increased difﬁculty with complex treatment
and monitoring plans and are at risk of
frailty, hypoglycemia, and disability (112).

In type 2 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia
is associated with reduced cognitive func-
tion, and those with poor cognitive function
have more severe or repeated episodes of
hypoglycemia. Multiple observational stud-
ies of adults with diabetes have found an
association between severe hypoglyce-
mic episodes and cognitive decline or in-
cident dementia (113–116). Decreased
cognitive function also increases the risk
for severe hypoglycemia, likely through
impaired ability to recognize and respond
appropriately to hypoglycemic symptoms
(113,117,118). Additionally, long-term follow-
up of Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes In-
terventions and Complications (DCCT/
EDIC) showed recurrent severe hypogly-
cemia was associated with the highest
risk of long-term psychomotor and men-
tal function decline (119). Simplifying or
deintensifying glycemic therapy and/or
liberalizing A1C goals may prevent hypo-
glycemia in individuals with cognitive dys-
function. See Section 13, “Older Adults,”
for more detailed discussion of hypogly-
cemia in older people with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes.

Dental Care

Recommendations
4.15 People with diabetes should be
referred for a dental exam at least
once per year. E
4.16 Coordinate efforts between the
medical and dental teams to appropri-
ately adjust glucose-lowering medica-
tion and treatment plans prior to and
in the post–dental procedure period
as needed. B

Periodontal disease is more severe, and
may be more prevalent, in people with
diabetes than in those without and has
been associated with higher A1C levels
(120–122). Longitudinal studies suggest
that people with periodontal disease
have higher rates of incident diabetes.
Current evidence suggests that periodon-
tal disease adversely affects diabetes out-
comes, and periodontal treatment using
subgingival instrumentation may improve
glycemic outcomes (123,124). In a ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT), intensive
treatment was associated
periodontal
with better glycemic outcomes (A1C 8.3%
vs. 7.8% in control subjects and the inten-
sive-treatment group, respectively) and

reduction in inﬂammatory markers after
12 months of follow-up (125).

Dental health professionals should be
included in the diabetes care team (126).
Early detection of oral health problems by
clinicians may be helpful
to promote
prompt referral to dental care and mitigate
the expensive and extensive procedures
needed to treat advanced oral disease
(127,128). Clinical assessment of people
with diabetes should include a dental his-
tory, and dental professionals should be in-
formed about key aspects of the person’s
health and diabetes treatment plan, in-
cluding glycemic goals, medications, and
comorbid conditions (127,128). It is impor-
tant for dental professionals to know
when people with diabetes have high A1C
levels, as this population may have lower
oral healing capacity (129,130). Hepatic,
renal, and pulmonary conditions should
also be known by dental professionals to
assist in appropriate dosing of antibiotics
and other medications. Coordination be-
tween dental professionals and the diabe-
tes care team will be especially important
for people treated with insulin, sulfonylur-
eas, or meglitinides who are at risk of hy-
poglycemia during dental procedures,
especially if fasting. The risk of hypoglyce-
mia can be mitigated by coordination be-
tween the dentist and treating clinician
prior to the procedure to make a hypogly-
cemia prevention plan, which may include
medication adjustment, blood glucose
monitoring before and during the proce-
dure, and treatment of hypoglycemia if ap-
propriate. Therefore, dental professionals
caring for people with diabetes should
have access to blood glucose monitors
during procedures as well as carbohy-
drates and glucagon to treat any hypo-
glycemia that occurs.

Disability

Recommendation
4.17 Assess for disability at the initial
visit and for decline in function at
each subsequent visit in people with
diabetes.
If a disability is impacting
functional ability or capacity to man-
age their diabetes, a referral should
be made to an appropriate health
care professional specializing in disabil-
ity (e.g., physical medicine and reha-
bilitation specialist, physical therapist,
occupational therapist, or speech-
language pathologist). C

impairment

A disability is deﬁned as a physical or
mental
that substantially
limits one or more major life activities
of an individual (131,132). Activities of
daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ac-
tivities of daily living (IADLs) comprise
basic and complex life care tasks, re-
spectively. The capacity to accomplish
such tasks serves as an important mea-
sure of function. Diabetes is associated
with an increase in the risk of work and
physical disability, with estimates of
50–80% increased risk of disability for
people with diabetes compared with
people without diabetes (133). Reviews
have shown that lower-body functional
limitation was the most prevalent dis-
ability (47–84%) among people with dia-
betes (134,135). In a systematic review
and meta-analysis, the presence of dia-
betes increased the risk of mobility dis-
ability (15 studies; odds ratio [OR] 1.71
[95% CI 1.53–1.91]; RR 1.51 [95% CI
1.38–1.64]), of IADL disability (10 stud-
ies; OR 1.65 [95% CI 1.55–1.74]), and of
ADL disability (16 studies; OR 1.82 [95% CI
1.63–2.04]; RR 1.82 [95% CI 1.40–2.36])
(133). The mechanisms underlying disabil-
ity are multifactorial and include obesity,
coronary artery disease, stroke, lower ex-
tremity complications, and physiological
factors such as hyperglycemia, sarcopenia,
inﬂammation, and insulin resistance (136).
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)
is a common complication of both type 1
and 2 diabetes and may cause impaired
postural balance and gait kinematics
(137),
leading to functional disability.
DPN can be found in up to half of peo-
ple with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, result-
ing in physical disability, and neuropathic
pain, resulting in a diminished quality of
life (138). Glycemic management pre-
vents DPN development in type 1 diabe-
tes; in contrast, glycemic management
has modest or no beneﬁt in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, possibly due to the
combined effect of coexisting comorbid-
ities (138). People with lower-extremity
involvement due to DPN have 3 times
more risk of restricted mobility, resulting
in people with DPN experiencing more
physical dysfunctions and impairments
than people who have diabetes but not
neuropathy (139). Furthermore, DPN may
progress to nontraumatic lower-limb am-
putation, which signiﬁcantly impacts qual-
ity of life (140).

In addition to complications of diabetes
from microvascular conditions such as CKD,

retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, and
peripheral neuropathy, it is important to
recognize the disabilities caused by macro-
vascular complications of diabetes. These
macrovascular complications, which include
coronary heart disease, stroke, and periph-
eral arterial disease, can lead to further im-
pairments (134).

An assessment of disability should be per-
formed as necessary with referrals made
to appropriate health care professionals
specializing in disability (e.g., physical
medicine and rehabilitation physician,
physical therapist, occupational therapist,
or speech-language pathologist) (133,141,
142). Customized rehabilitation interven-
tions for individuals with a disability from
diabetes can recover function, allowing for
safe physical activity (143), and improve
quality of life (144). Additionally, frailty is
commonly associated with diabetes, with
progression to disability, morbidity, and
mortality in older adults. People with dia-
betes as well as frailty or disability may
contend with comorbid conditions such as
hypoglycemia, sarcopenia, falls, and cogni-
tive dysfunction. A thorough medical eval-
uation is imperative to identify the best
approaches to preventative and therapeu-
tic interventions for frailty and diabetes
management (145).

To assess the impact of diabetes on an
individual’s daily functioning, clinicians
should consider evaluating their ability to
perform ADLs and IADLs, ensuring they
can manage basic self-care and more
complex tasks necessary for speciﬁc living
situations, services, and supports. A psy-
chosocial assessment should be conducted
to screen for behavioral health conditions
like depression and anxiety and to under-
stand the individual’s social support and
coping mechanisms. Functional capacity
evaluations, involving tests for physical en-
durance and strength, are used to gauge
the ability of the person with diabetes to
work and carry out daily activities. Addi-
tionally, standardized disability question-
naires and scales, such as the Diabetes
Distress Scale (DDS) and the World Health
Organization Disability Assessment Sched-
ule (WHODAS 2.0), are employed to mea-
sure the emotional burden of diabetes and
overall disability (146,147). These sug-
gested structured assessments are particu-
larly relevant if individuals have fallen, had
emergency department visits, missed ap-
pointments, made signiﬁcant errors in the
treatment plan, or exhibit apathy and de-
pressed mood.

Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities

S71

Moreover, when treating people with
an acquired disability from diabetes, it
is vital to consider social determinants
of health, race and ethnicity, and socio-
economic status (148). Rates of diabetes-
related major amputations are higher in
individuals who are from racial and ethnic
minoritized groups (149),
live in rural
areas, and are from regions with the low-
est socioeconomic levels (150). Address-
ing the complex challenges faced by
individuals with acquired disabilities from
diabetes requires a multifaceted approach
involving solutions from both within and
outside the health care system. By
focusing on social determinants of health,
health care professionals can develop
appropriate interventions, provide advo-
cacy, and establish support systems that
cater to the speciﬁc needs of this popu-
lation. See Section 1, “Improving Care
and Promoting Health in Populations.”

Hepatitis C
Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is as-
sociated with a higher prevalence of type 2
diabetes, which is present in up to one-
third of individuals with chronic HCV infec-
tion. HCV may impair glucose metabolism
by several mechanisms, including directly
via viral proteins and indirectly by altering
proinﬂammatory cytokine levels (151). The
use of newer direct-acting antiviral drugs
produces a sustained virological response
(cure) in nearly all cases and has been re-
ported to improve glucose metabolism in
individuals with diabetes (152). A meta-
analysis of mostly observational studies
found a mean reduction in A1C levels of
0.45% (95% CI –0.60 to –0.30) and reduced
requirement for glucose-lowering medica-
tion use following successful eradication of
HCV infection (153).

Low Testosterone in Men

Recommendation
4.18 In men with diabetes or predi-
abetes, inquire about sexual health
(e.g.,
low libido and erectile dys-
function [ED]). If symptoms and/or
signs of hypogonadism are detected
(e.g.,
low libido, ED, and depres-
sion), screen with a morning serum
total testosterone level. B

Mean levels of testosterone are lower in
men with diabetes than in age-matched
men without diabetes, but obesity is a
major confounder (154,155). Testosterone

replacement in men with symptomatic hy-
pogonadism may have beneﬁts, including
improved sexual function, well-being, mus-
cle mass and strength, and bone density
In men with diabetes who have
(156).
symptoms or signs of low testosterone (hy-
pogonadism), a morning total testosterone
level should be measured using an accu-
rate and reliable assay (157). In men who
have total testosterone levels close to the
lower limit, it is reasonable to determine
free testosterone concentrations either di-
rectly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by
calculations that use total testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, and albumin
concentrations (157). Further tests (such
as luteinizing hormone and follicle-
stimulating hormone levels) may be needed
to further evaluate the individual. Testoster-
one replacement in older men with hypogo-
nadism has been associated with increased
coronary artery plaque volume, with no
conclusive evidence that testosterone sup-
plementation is associated with increased
cardiovascular risk in all men with hypogo-
nadism (157). Furthermore, erectile dys-
function (ED) is also common in people
with diabetes (158), and it is reasonable to
measure and correct testosterone levels
close to the lower limit to address the de-
sire component that contributes to erectile
difﬁculties (159) (see ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, be-
low, for more information on evaluation
and further discussion).

Erectile Dysfunction

Recommendation
4.19 In men with diabetes or predia-
betes, screen for ED, particularly in
those with high cardiovascular risk,
retinopathy, cardiovascular disease,
chronic kidney disease, peripheral or
autonomic neuropathy,
longer dura-
tion of diabetes, depression, and hy-
pogonadism, and in those who are
not meeting glycemic goals. B

The most common sexual dysfunction in
men is ED, with an estimated prevalence
of 52.5% in men with diabetes (160). The
best predictors of ED are age (>40 years),
CVD, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dys-
lipidemia, metabolic syndrome, hypogo-
nadism, smoking, depression, and use of
medications such as antidepressants and
opioids (161,162). Because diabetes, poor
nutrition, obesity, lack of exercise, and
CVD are often interrelated,
it may be
challenging to identify the primary risk

factor (159), although the most likely pri-
mary underlying risk factor is vascular dis-
ease (159).

Men with diabetes are at increased
risk for both CVD and ED, and ED is a pre-
dictor of cardiovascular events in men
with diabetes (163,164) as well as in
men without diabetes. The signiﬁcant
factors associated with ED in men with
diabetes are age, peripheral or auto-
nomic neuropathy, presence of micro-
vascular disease including retinopathy,
CVD, duration of diabetes, poor glycemic
management, hypogonadism, and diuretic
therapy (165). Physical activity may be pro-
tective. Men with diabetes and ED report
a signiﬁcant decline in quality-of-life meas-
ures and an increase in depressive symp-
toms (166), and depression is a well-
recognized risk factor for ED. Given the
bidirectional relationship between ED
and depression, treatment of either one
can result in improvement in the other
condition. CKD is also a risk factor for
CVD and ED, with prevalence rates of ED
>75% in men on hemodialysis (167).

Awareness and identiﬁcation of these
characteristics, factors, and behaviors can
guide clinicians in early screening, treat-
ment, prevention, and counseling in all
men with diabetes and particularly those
at higher risk for ED (165). Given the evi-
dence that ED is strongly associated with
diabetes and CVD, men with ED should
be evaluated and managed for cardiovas-
cular and endocrine risk factors. Glycemic
assessment in men not previously diag-
lipid proﬁle, and
nosed with diabetes,
morning total testosterone should be
considered mandatory in all men newly
presenting with ED (168).

In a recent meta-analysis, testosterone
was superior to placebo in improving
erectile function in men with testoster-
one deﬁciency; however, the magnitude
of the effect was lower in the presence of
diabetes and obesity (169).

Meta-analyses show that all phosphodi-
esterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) are su-
perior to placebo in treating ED,
lower
dosages had effects comparable with those
of higher dosages, and various PDE5Is
show comparable efﬁcacy (159). PDE5Is
are associated with an increased risk of
headaches, ﬂushing, and dyspepsia (159).
First-line therapy for ED in men with diabe-
tes is PDE5Is, but men with diabetes may
be less responsive than men without diabe-
tes (160). Strategies to improve response
include daily therapy and
to PDE5Is

optimization of comorbidities. In men with
diabetes not responding to PDEIs, other po-
tentially effective treatments may include
intracavernosal injections, intraurethral
prostaglandin, vacuum erection devices,
and penile prosthetic surgery (160).

Female Sexual Dysfunction

Recommendations
4.20 In women with diabetes or predi-
abetes, inquire about sexual health by
screening for desire (libido), arousal,
and orgasm difﬁculties, particularly in
those who experience depression
and/or anxiety and those with recur-
rent urinary tract infections. B
4.21 In postmenopausal women with
diabetes or prediabetes, screen for
symptoms and/or signs of genitouri-
nary syndrome of menopause, includ-
ing vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. B

Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is common
in women with diabetes. In an epidemio-
logic cross-sectional study of community-
residing middle-aged and older adults
(57–85 years), women with diagnosed dia-
betes were less likely than men with diag-
nosed diabetes (adjusted OR 0.28 [95% CI
0.16–0.49]) and women without diabetes
(0.63 [0.45–0.87]) to be sexually active
(170). Older women with diabetes are as
likely as men to have sexual problems but
are signiﬁcantly less likely to have discussed
sex with a physician (170).

While studies showing the association
between diabetes and FSD are less conclu-
sive than those in men, most have reported
a higher prevalence of FSD in women with
diabetes compared with women without
diabetes (171). A meta-analysis found that
sexual dysfunctions are more common in
women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (OR
2.27 and 2.49, respectively) than in women
without diabetes (172).

Reviews report a wide range of preva-
lence rates of sexual dysfunctions in
women with diabetes. In women with
type 1 diabetes, 16–85% (vs. 0–66% in
women without diabetes) report prob-
lems with desire, 11–76% (vs. 0–41%) re-
port problems with arousal, and 9–66%
(vs. 0–39%) report problems with orgasm;
9–57% (vs. 0–28%) report problems with
lubrication, and 7–61% (vs. 5–39%) report
problems with pain. In women with type 2
diabetes, 70–82% (vs. 10–66% in women
without diabetes) report problems with
desire, 54–68% (vs. 3–41%)
report

problems with arousal, and 33–84% (vs.
2–39%) report problems with orgasm;
33–66% (vs. 4–28%) report problems
with lubrication, and 33–46% (vs. 8–39%)
report problems with pain (173).

The Diabetes MILES (Management and
Impact for Long-term Empowerment and
Success) study examined the prevalence of
sexual dysfunction in sexually active women
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and the asso-
ciations between sexual dysfunction and
clinical and psychological variables. Over-
all, 33% of women reported sexual dys-
function (type 1, 36.0%; type 2, 26.2%).
The prevalence of speciﬁc FSDs accord-
ing to diabetes type was decreased de-
sire (type 1, 22%; type 2, 15%), decreased
arousal (type 1, 9%; type 2, 11%), lubrica-
tion problems (type 1, 19%; type 2, 14%),
and orgasmic dysfunction (type 1, 16%;
type 2, 15%) (173).

Medical comorbidities that are risk fac-
tors for FSD include hypertension, obesity,
metabolic syndrome, smoking, and hyper-
lipidemia. Clinical factors for consideration
include longer duration of diabetic retinop-
athy and neuropathy and individuals not
meeting glycemic goals. The prevalence of
FSD in women with end-stage kidney dis-
ease is 74% (174).

In women with diabetes, social and psy-
chological components play a major role
in FSD. Depression, anxiety, and emotional
adjustments to diabetes have been found
to be associated with sexual dysfunctions
in women with diabetes. A study from
Norway reported that women with type 1
diabetes with scores on the Female Sexual
Function Index (FSFI) (a validated instru-
ment) indicating sexual dysfunction were
more likely than women without sexual
dysfunction to have diabetes distress, de-
pression, and menopausal symptoms. They
were also older and more likely to be single
and postmenopausal (175). Another study
also showed that women with sexual dys-
function were signiﬁcantly more likely to
report impaired well-being, have elevated
diabetes distress, have poor adjustment to
diabetes, and have more moderate to se-
vere anxiety than women without sexual
dysfunctions (173).

In a qualitative study exploring the
experiences of sexual health and sexual
challenges, women with type 1 diabetes
reported that diabetes affected their re-
lationship, including sex life, and had an
impact on their partner. Challenges in-
cluded reduced sexual desire, decline
less spontaneous desire
in frequency,

resulting in lack of initiation, and physi-
cal challenges such as pain, vaginal dry-
ness, and impaired sensitivity. Several
women explained that vaginal dryness
inter-
was an obstacle during sexual
course, leading to pain or even refraining
from sexual activity. Sexual challenges
were perceived to become a source of
disappointment to the partners and con-
sequential guilt for the women. Women
also reported fear of hypoglycemia during
sex, and some reported trying to maintain
mild hyperglycemia. Technology devices,
such as glucose monitors and insulin
pumps, could be perceived as both a phys-
ical and mental obstacle during sexual ac-
tivity (176).

Women with type 2 (25%) or type 1
(17%) diabetes would like their health
care professional to initiate a discussion
on how diabetes is affecting their sex life
(177). Women with type 1 diabetes almost
unanimously endorsed that sexual health
should be addressed, that they would ﬁnd
it a relief that they were not alone, that
they should be provided with information
when they are young, and that it would be
difﬁcult to address the topic themselves
(176). Unfortunately, many health care pro-
fessionals do not actively discuss sexual
functioning in consultations, meaning that
when the topic is discussed it is mostly the
person with diabetes who initiates the con-
versation (170). This leads to a marked un-
derdiagnosis and undertreatment of sexual
dysfunctions in people with diabetes.

While no speciﬁc guidelines are avail-
able for the treatment of FSD in this pop-
ulation, women with type 1 or type 2
diabetes should be encouraged to engage
in lifestyle interventions and, in the ab-
sence of contraindications, may beneﬁt
from already-approved treatments for
FSD (178). The Look AHEAD (Action for
Health in Diabetes) study on intervention
demonstrated statistical improvements in
the FSFI total score and all domains of
sexual dysfunction (179). Lifestyle factors
that enhance desire and sexual function in-
clude nutrition (such as the Mediterranean
eating pattern), exercise (such as walking),
and smoking cessation. Other interventions
include improving glycemic management
and prevention of diabetes complications;
diagnosis and treatment of menopausal
symptoms with hormonal therapies; ad-
dressing vaginal dryness and dyspareunia
as well as urinary tract and mycotic genital
infections; screening and addressing de-
pression, anxiety, diabetes distress, and

Metabolic Dysfunction–Associated
Steatotic Liver Disease and Metabolic
Dysfunction–Associated Steatohepatitis
Screening

Recommendations
4.22a Screen adults with type 2 diabe-
tes or with prediabetes, particularly
those with obesity or other cardiome-
tabolic risk factors or established car-
diovascular disease, for their risk of
having or developing cirrhosis related
to metabolic dysfunction–associated
steatohepatitis (MASH) using a calcu-
lated ﬁbrosis-4 index (FIB-4) (derived
from age, ALT, AST, and platelets
[mdcalc.com/calc/2200/ﬁbrosis4-ﬁb-4-
index-liver-ﬁbrosis]), even if they have
normal liver enzymes. B
4.22b Adults with diabetes or predi-
abetes with persistently elevated
plasma aminotransferase levels for
>6 months and low FIB-4 should
be evaluated for other causes of
liver disease. B
4.23 Adults with type 2 diabetes or
prediabetes with a FIB-4 $1.3 should
have additional risk stratiﬁcation by
liver stiffness measurement with tran-
sient elastography, or,
if unavailable,
the enhanced liver ﬁbrosis (ELF) test. B
4.24 Refer adults with type 2 diabetes
or prediabetes at higher risk for signiﬁ-
cant liver ﬁbrosis (i.e., as indicated by
FIB-4, liver stiffness measurement, or
ELF) to a gastroenterologist or hepa-
tologist for further evaluation and
management. B

Metabolic dysfunction–associated stea-
totic liver disease (MASLD) has replaced
the term nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) to identify steatotic liver dis-
ease. The deﬁnition includes the pres-
ence of steatotic liver disease and at
least one cardiometabolic risk factor as-
sociated with insulin resistance (e.g.,
prediabetes, diabetes, atherogenic dysli-
pidemia, or hypertension) without other
identiﬁable causes of steatosis (180).
This is in the absence of ongoing or re-
cent consumption of signiﬁcant amounts
of alcohol (deﬁned as ingestion of >21
standard drinks per week in men and
>14 standard drinks per week in women

over a 2-year period preceding evalua-
tion) or other secondary causes of he-
patic steatosis (181). It is estimated that
in adults in the U.S., the prevalence of
MASLD is >70% of people with type 2 di-
abetes (182–184). This is consistent with
studies from other countries (185,186).
The new deﬁnition of MASLD aims to re-
move potential stigma from the term
“fatty” when referring to steatosis, high-
lights the role of prediabetes and type 2
diabetes in MASLD, and provides a posi-
tive diagnosis by using cardiometabolic
risk factors as surrogates for insulin resis-
tance, the main driver for the develop-
ment of steatosis. The new deﬁnition
correlates well with the past deﬁnition
of MASLD for people with prediabetes or
type 2 diabetes (who already have, by
deﬁnition, one cardiometabolic risk factor)
(187,188). A separate category outside of
MASLD, named metabolic dysfunction and
alcoholic liver disease, was created for cir-
cumstances in which alcohol
intake is
greater than that allowed for MASLD but
less than that attributed to alcoholic liver
disease. More research is needed to better
characterize the predictive value for meta-
bolic dysfunction–associated steatohepati-
tis (MASH) of different cardiometabolic
risk factors and the natural history of met-
abolic dysfunction and alcoholic liver dis-
ease or steatosis in young adults without
cardiometabolic risk factors.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for de-
veloping MASH (formerly nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis, or NASH) and worse liver
outcomes (185,186). MASH is deﬁned his-
tologically as having $5% hepatic steato-
sis with inﬂammation and hepatocyte
injury (hepatocyte ballooning), with or
without evidence of liver ﬁbrosis (181).
Steatohepatitis is estimated to affect more
than half of people with type 2 diabetes
with MASLD (189,190). Fibrosis stages are
classiﬁed histologically as the following:
F0, no ﬁbrosis; F1, mild; F2, moderate (sig-
niﬁcant); F3, severe (advanced); and F4,
cirrhosis. In the U.S., between 12% and
20% of people with type 2 diabetes have
“at-risk” MASH (i.e., steatohepatitis with
clinically signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis [$F2] and at
risk for cirrhosis) (182,183,189). A similar
or higher prevalence has been observed
worldwide (185,186,190). People with
type 2 diabetes and at-risk MASH are at
an increased risk of future cirrhosis, hepa-
tocellular carcinoma (HCC) (191,192), and
liver transplantation (193). The prevalence
of MASLD in people with type 1 diabetes

is (cid:4)20% and is driven by obesity, which is
becoming more common in this popula-
tion (194), with a large variability across
studies using different steatosis measure-
ment methods (195). The prevalence of
liver steatosis in a population with type 1
diabetes by MRI (i.e., the gold standard)
with low prevalence of obesity was only
8.8% compared with 68% in people with
type 2 diabetes (196). The prevalence of
clinically signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis ($F2) is esti-
mated to be (cid:4)5% (197), which is much
lower than the prevalence in type 2 diabe-
tes (182,183,189). Therefore, screening for
ﬁbrosis in people with type 1 diabetes
should only be considered in the presence
of additional risk factors for MASLD, such as
obesity, incidental hepatic steatosis on imag-
ing, or elevated plasma aminotransferases.

Clinicians underestimate the preva-
lence of at-risk MASH and do not consis-
tently implement appropriate screening
strategies in people with prediabetes or
type 2 diabetes, thus missing a chance to
establish an early diagnosis (198). This
pattern of underdiagnosis is compounded
by sparse referral to specialists and inade-
quate prescription of medications with
potential efﬁcacy in MASH (199,200). The
goal of screening for MASLD is to identify
people with at-risk MASH to prevent fu-
ture cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplantation,
and all-cause mortality (201–204). This
risk is higher in people who have central
obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors or
insulin resistance, are >50 years of age,
and/or have persistently elevated plasma
aminotransferases
and/or ALT
>30 units/L for >6 months) (205,206).
Some genetic variants that alter hepato-
cyte triglyceride metabolism may also in-
crease the risk of MASH progression and
cirrhosis (207,208), amplifying the impact
of obesity, but the role of genetic testing
in clinical practice remains to be estab-
lished. Individuals with MASLD also are
at a greater risk of developing extrahe-
patic cancer (192), type 2 diabetes (209),
and CVD (210,211). Emerging evidence
suggests that MASLD increases the risk
of CKD in people with type 2 diabetes,
particularly when liver ﬁbrosis is present
(212,213), although the association of
MASLD with diabetic retinopathy is less
clear (214).

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

primary care and diabetes clinical set-
tings (186,200,205,206,215–217). The
diagnostic algorithm for the screening
and liver ﬁbrosis risk stratiﬁcation of peo-
ple with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes is
shown in Fig. 4.2. A screening strategy
relying on elevated plasma aminotrans-
ferases >40 units/L would miss most in-
dividuals with MASH in these settings, as
at-risk MASH with clinically signiﬁcant
ﬁbrosis ($F2)
is frequently observed
with plasma aminotransferases below the
commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L
(182–184,189,218,219). The American Col-
lege of Gastroenterology considers the
upper limit of normal ALT levels to be
29–33 units/L for male individuals and
19–25 units/L for female individuals (220),
as higher levels are associated with in-
creased liver-related mortality. The FIB-4 es-
timates the risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is
calculated from the computation of age,
plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT),
and platelet count (mdcalc.com/calc/2200/
ﬁbrosis-4-ﬁb-4-index-liver-ﬁbrosis). A value
of <1.3 is considered low risk of having ad-
vanced ﬁbrosis (F3–F4) and for developing
adverse liver outcomes, while $1.3 is con-
sidered as having a higher probability of

at-risk MASH clinically signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis
($F2) and increased risk of adverse liver
outcomes. A value of >2.67 confers a high
risk of having advanced ﬁbrosis (F3–F4),
and referral to the liver specialist is war-
ranted without additional testing. FIB-4
predicts changes over time in hepatic ﬁ-
brosis (221,222) and allows risk stratiﬁ-
cation of individuals in terms of future
liver-related morbidity and mortality (223).
FIB-4 has reasonable speciﬁcity but low
sensitivity, hence a negative result rules
out ﬁbrosis while a positive result requires
conﬁrmatory testing (222,224,225). Its
low cost, simplicity, and good speciﬁcity
make it the initial test of choice (Fig. 4.2).
FIB-4 has not been validated in pediatric
populations or in adults aged <35 years.
In people with diabetes $65 years of age,
higher cutoffs for FIB-4 have been recom-
mended (1.9–2.0 rather than $1.3) (226).
In people with a FIB-4 $1.3, there is
need for additional risk stratiﬁcation with
a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by
transient elastography (Fig. 4.2). Use of a
second nonproprietary diagnostic panel is
not recommended (e.g., MASLD ﬁbrosis
score and others), as they generally do not
perform better than FIB-4 (181,184,224).

Transient elastography (LSM) is the best-
validated imaging technique for ﬁbrosis
risk stratiﬁcation, and it predicts future cir-
rhosis and all-cause mortality in MASLD
(205,206,227). An LSM value of <8.0 kPa
has a good negative predictive value
to exclude advanced ﬁbrosis ($F3–F4)
(228–230) and indicates lower risk for
clinically signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis. Such individ-
uals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes
can be followed in nonspecialty clinics
with repeat surveillance testing every
$2 years, although the precise time in-
terval remains to be established. If the
LSM is $8.0 kPa, the risk for advanced ﬁ-
brosis ($F3–F4) is higher and such individ-
uals should be referred to the hepatologist

outcomes. Individuals with ELF $9.8 are
considered at high risk of having MASH

therefore are at risk for adverse liver
outcomes (181,217). They should be re-
ferred to a gastroenterologist or hepa-
tologist. The optimal cutoff for clinical
use of ELF in primary care and endocri-
nology settings is evolving (239–242).
An ELF <9.8 suggests an individual is at
low risk of advanced liver ﬁbrosis and
may be followed in the nonspecialty
clinic with repeat testing in $2 years
but may need repeat testing more often
if ELF is between 9.2 and 9.7.

Specialists may order additional tests
for ﬁbrosis risk stratiﬁcation in MASH
(180,205,206,217),
including magnetic
resonance elastography (MRE) (best over-
all performance, particularly for early
ﬁbrosis stages) or multiparametric iron-
corrected T1 MRI (cT1) (243) and pat-
ented blood-based ﬁbrosis biomarkers.
While liver biopsy remains the gold stan-
dard for the diagnosis of MASH, its indi-
cation is reserved to the discretion of
the specialist within an interprofessional
team approach due to high costs and po-
tential for morbidity associated with this
procedure.

Management

Recommendations
4.25 Adults with type 2 diabetes or
prediabetes, particularly with over-
weight or obesity, who have meta-
bolic dysfunction–associated steatotic
liver disease (MASLD) should be rec-
ommended lifestyle changes using an
interprofessional approach that pro-
motes weight loss,
ideally within a
structured nutrition plan and physical
activity program for cardiometabolic
beneﬁts B and histological
improve-
ment. C
4.26 In adults with type 2 diabetes,
MASLD, and overweight or obesity,
consider using a glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) or a
dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA for
the treatment of obesity with poten-
tial beneﬁts in MASH as an adjunctive
therapy to lifestyle interventions for
weight loss. B
4.27a In adults with type 2 diabetes
and biopsy-proven MASH or those
at high risk for liver ﬁbrosis (based
on noninvasive tests), pioglitazone,
a GLP-1 RA, or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA
is preferred for glycemic management

because of potential beneﬁcial effects
on MASH. B
4.27b Combination therapy with piogli-
tazone plus GLP-1 RA can be considered
for the treatment of hyperglycemia in
adults with type 2 diabetes with biopsy-
proven MASH or those at high risk of
liver ﬁbrosis (identiﬁed with noninva-
sive tests) because of potential bene-
ﬁcial effects on MASH.B
4.28 For consideration of treatment
with a thyroid hormone receptor-b
agonist in adults with type 2 diabe-
tes or prediabetes with MASLD with
moderate (F2) or advanced (F3) liver
ﬁbrosis on liver histology, or by a vali-
dated imaging-based or blood-based
test, refer to a gastroenterologist or
hepatologist with expertise in MASLD
management. A
4.29 Treatment initiation and monitor-
ing should be individualized and within
the context of an interprofessional
team that includes a gastroenterolo-
gist or hepatologist, consideration of
individual preferences, and a careful
shared-decision cost-beneﬁt discus-
sion. B
4.30a In adults with type 2 diabetes
and MASLD, use of glucose-lowering
than pioglitazone
therapies other
or GLP-1 RAs may be continued as
clinically indicated, but these ther-
apies lack evidence of beneﬁt in
MASH. B
4.30b Insulin therapy is the pre-
ferred agent for the treatment of
hyperglycemia in adults with type 2
diabetes with decompensated cir-
rhosis. C
4.31a Adults with type 2 diabetes
and MASLD are at increased cardio-
vascular risk; therefore, comprehen-
sive management of cardiovascular
risk factors is recommended. B
4.31b Statin therapy is safe in adults
with type 2 diabetes and compensated
cirrhosis from MASLD and should be
initiated or continued for cardiovascu-
lar risk reduction as clinically indicated.
B In people with decompensated cir-
rhosis, statin therapy should be used
with caution, and close monitoring is
needed, given limited safety and efﬁ-
cacy data. B
4.32a Consider metabolic surgery in
appropriate candidates as an option
to treat MASH in adults with type 2

diabetes B and to improve cardio-
vascular outcomes. B
4.32b Metabolic surgery should be
used with caution in adults with type 2
diabetes with compensated cirrhosis
from MASLD B and is not recom-
mended in decompensated cirrhosis. B

While steatohepatitis and cirrhosis occur in
lean people with diabetes and are believed
to be linked to genetic predisposition, insu-
lin resistance, and environmental factors
(244,245), ample evidence implicates excess
visceral fat and overall adiposity in people
with overweight and obesity in the patho-
genesis of the disease (246,247). Obesity
in the setting of type 2 diabetes worsens
insulin resistance and steatohepatitis,
promoting the development of cirrhosis
(248). Therefore, clinicians should enact
evidence-based interventions (as dis-
cussed in Section 5, “Facilitating Positive
Health Behaviors and Well-being to
Improve Health Outcomes”) to promote
healthy lifestyle change and weight loss
for people with overweight or obesity
and MASLD. There is consensus that a
minimum weight loss goal of 5%, prefer-
ably $10%, is needed to improve liver
histology (181,205,206,217), with ﬁbro-
sis requiring the larger weight reduction
to promote change (249,250). However,
there is signiﬁcant individual variability in
histological outcomes with weight loss. In-
dividualized, structured weight loss and
exercise programs offer greater beneﬁt
than standard counseling in people with
MASLD (251).

Dietary recommendations to induce
an energy deﬁcit are not different from
those for people with diabetes with
obesity without MASLD and should in-
clude a reduction of macronutrient con-
tent, limiting saturated fat, starch, and
added sugar, with adoption of healthier
eating patterns. The Mediterranean eat-
ing pattern has the best evidence for im-
proving liver and cardiometabolic health
(205,215–217,251). Both aerobic and
resistance training improve MASLD in pro-
portion to treatment engagement and in-
tensity of the program (252). Obesity
pharmacotherapy may assist with weight
loss in the context of lifestyle modiﬁcation
if not achieved by lifestyle modiﬁcation
alone (see Section 8, “Obesity and Weight
Management
the Prevention and
for
Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes”).

Given the high prevalence of at-risk

MASH ((cid:4)12–20%)
higher risk of disease progression and
liver-related mortality (185,204,253), and
the lack of pharmacological treatments
once cirrhosis is established (254,255),
optimizing the pharmacological manage-
ment of hyperglycemia and obesity in
people with type 2 diabetes and MASH
could serve the dual purpose of address-
ing these comorbidities while treating
the liver disease (Fig. 4.3). Therefore,
early diagnosis and treatment of MASLD
offers the best opportunity for cirrhosis
In phase 2 clinical trials,
prevention.
pioglitazone and some GLP-1 RAs have
been shown to be potentially effective
to treat steatohepatitis (205,256–259) and
to slow ﬁbrosis progression (260–262).
They may also decrease CVD (257), which
is the number one cause of death in peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes and MASLD
(210). Evidence from phase 3 clinical trials
still are not fully published (e.g., a phase
3 study on semaglutide, The Effect of Sem-
aglutide in Subjects With Non-cirrhotic
Non- alcoholic Steatohepatitis [ESSENSE]
trial, is predicted to be published in 2025)
(263), and no glucose-lowering or weight
management medication is FDA approved for
the treatment of MASH. The recommendation

to treat hyperglycemia with GLP-1 RAs and/or
pioglitazone in people with type 2 diabetes
and MASLD is based on consistent histo-
logical beneﬁt for steatohepatitis in sev-
eral phase 2 RCTs with GLP-1 RAs and
with pioglitazone (264–268) compared
with no beneﬁt with metformin or other
glucose-lowering medications in MASH
(181,205,206).

Pioglitazone improves glucose and lipid
metabolism and reverses steatohepatitis
in people with prediabetes or type 2 dia-
betes (261,264,265) and even in individu-
als without diabetes (266–268) (Fig. 4.3).
Fibrosis also improved in some trials
(265,267). A meta-analysis (260) concluded
that pioglitazone treatment results in reso-
lution of MASH and may improve ﬁbrosis.
Furthermore, combination therapy with
pioglitazone plus a GLP-1 RA has been
reported safe and effective for the treat-
ment of hyperglycemia in adults with
type 2 diabetes (269–272) as well as in
reducing hepatic steatosis (269,271), sug-
gesting additive beneﬁt in individuals with
MASLD. It is important to note that these
studies are based on phase 2 clinical trials
and await further phase 3 evidence. How-
ever, these plans are attractive because
they offer potential beneﬁt compared
with lack of histological beneﬁt (or clinical

trial data) from other oral glucose-lower-
ing therapies in MASLD. In the context of
treating hyperglycemia in people with
type 2 diabetes with MASLD, where the
low cost of pioglitazone and any liver im-
provement would be an added beneﬁt to
glycemic management, these plans would
be potentially cost-effective for the treat-
ment of MASLD (273,274). Vitamin E may
be beneﬁcial for the treatment of MASH
in people without diabetes (266). How-
ever, in people with type 2 diabetes, vita-
min E monotherapy was found to be
ineffective in a small RCT (261), and it did
not seem to enhance pioglitazone’s efﬁ-
cacy when used in combination, as re-
ported in an earlier trial in this population
(265). Pioglitazone causes dose-dependent
weight gain (15 mg/day, mean weight
gain of 1–2%; 45 mg/day, mean weight
gain of 3–5%), which can be blunted or
reversed if combined with SGLT2 inhibi-
tors or GLP-1 RAs (257,271,272,275).
Pioglitazone increases fracture risk, may
promote heart failure if used in individu-
als with preexisting congestive heart fail-
ure, and may increase the risk of bladder
cancer, although this remains controversial
(181,205,206,257,258).

GLP-1 RAs are effective at inducing
weight loss and ameliorating elevated

plasma aminotransferases and steatosis
(256) (Fig. 4.3). However, there are few
phase 2 RCTs of GLP-1 RAs in individuals
with MASH proven by biopsy. A small
RCT reported that liraglutide improved
some features of MASH and may delay
ﬁbrosis progression (276). Subcutaneous
semaglutide treatment in 320 people
with MASH (62% having type 2 diabe-
tes) led to resolution of steatohepatitis
without worsening of ﬁbrosis in 59% of
individuals at the higher dose (equiva-
lent to 2.4 mg/week semaglutide) com-
pared with 17% in the placebo group
(P < 0.001) (262). Cumulatively, sema-
glutide did not signiﬁcantly affect the
stage of liver ﬁbrosis in this group of
people but, over 72 weeks, slowed the
progression of liver ﬁbrosis (4.9% with
the GLP-1 RA at the highest dose com-
pared with 18.8% on placebo). Tirzepa-
tide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA known
to reduce liver steatosis in MASLD
(277), and a phase 2 paired-biopsy study
of 190 adults with overweight or obesity
with MASH (50–60% of whom had type 2
diabetes) recently reported that doses of 5,
10, and 15 mg/day resulted in resolution
of steatohepatitis without worsening of ﬁ-
brosis in 44%, 56%, and 62% of partici-
pants, respectively, compared with 10% of
participants receiving placebo (P < 0.001
for all three comparisons) (278). Improve-
ment of at least one ﬁbrosis stage without
worsening of MASH occurred in 55%, 51%,
and 61% of participants, respectively, com-
pared with 30% of participants receiving
placebo. Survodutide is a dual GLP-1 and
glucagon RA that is in development, and a
phase 2 paired-biopsy trial recently re-
ported beneﬁt in MASH (279). In summary,
GLP-1–based therapies and/or pioglitazone is
recommended to treat type 2 diabetes in
adults with MASH based on histological
beneﬁt for steatohepatitis in several
phase 2 RCTs (278,279) compared
with no beneﬁt with metformin or
other glucose-lowering or weight loss
medications. Within the context of their
approved indication (e.g., obesity or type 2
diabetes), these medications are cost-
effective to treat the comorbidity, while
potentially improving MASH, which be-
comes an added beneﬁt.

SGLT2 inhibitors (280–282) and insulin
(258) reduce hepatic steatosis, but their ef-
fects on steatohepatitis remain unknown.
The use of glucose-lowering agents other
than pioglitazone or GLP-1 RAs may be
continued in individuals with type 2

diabetes and MASLD for glycemic man-
agement, as clinically indicated. However,
these agents have either failed to im-
prove steatohepatitis in paired-biopsy
studies (metformin) or have no RCTs with
liver histological end points (i.e., sulfonyl-
ureas, glitinides, dipeptidyl peptidase 4
inhibitors, or acarbose).

Resmetirom is a thyroid hormone re-
ceptor-b agonist approved by the FDA
for the treatment of adults with MASLD
with moderate (F2) or advanced (F3)
liver ﬁbrosis on liver histology or a vali-
dated imaging- or blood-based test. In a
phase 3 RCT, resmetirom for 52 weeks in
966 adults at the highest dose of 100 mg
(or placebo) met the primary end point
of MASH resolution without worsening
of ﬁbrosis in 29.9% of participants com-
pared with 9.7% on placebo (P < 0.001)
(283). Fibrosis improved in up to 25.9%
and 14.2%, respectively (P < 0.001). Nau-
sea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred
more often with resmetirom. The gastro-
intestinal side effects are dose dependent
and improve with continued treatment.
Resmetirom decreased free thyroxine (T4)
levels by (cid:4)20% and increased sex hor-
mone-binding protein levels two- to three-
fold. Although a recent review of the data
concluded that there is little concern
about these changes, long-term postmar-
keting data must be collected (284,285).
Guidance by the American Association for
the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) about
optimal individual identiﬁcation for treat-
ment, safety, and long-term monitoring
has recently been published (286). This is
especially relevant because hypothyroid-
ism and hypogonadism are more preva-
lent in people with MASLD than in the
general population (181,205), and clini-
cians should monitor all individuals with
MASLD for symptoms of endocrine deﬁ-
ciency and manage according to clinical
practice guidelines. Per its label, candi-
dates for resmetirom treatment are those
with MASLD and moderate (F2) to ad-
vanced (F3) liver ﬁbrosis but not with cir-
rhosis or other active liver disease (i.e.,
alcohol-related liver disease, autoimmune
hepatitis, or primary biliary cholangitis) or
unmanaged hypothyroidism or hyperthy-
roidism. Given complexities associated
with selection of an individual for therapy,
drug cost, and treatment monitoring, ther-
apy should be individualized and initiated
by a hepatologist or gastroenterologist
with expertise in MASH within an interpro-
fessional team.

Insulin is the preferred glucose-lowering
agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia
in adults with type 2 diabetes with decom-
pensated cirrhosis given the lack of robust
evidence about the safety and efﬁcacy of
oral agents and noninsulin injectables (i.e.,
GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RAs)
(255), although a recent 48-week study
suggested that GLP-1 RAs are safe in indi-
viduals with MASH and compensated cir-
rhosis (287).

Metabolic surgery leading to sustained
weight loss and improvement of type 2 di-
abetes can improve MASH and cardiome-
tabolic health, altering the natural history
of the disease (288). Meta-analyses report
that 70–80% of people have improvement
in hepatic steatosis, 50–75% of people
have improvement in inﬂammation and
hepatocyte ballooning (necrosis), and
30–40% of people have improvement in ﬁ-
brosis (289,290). It may also reduce the
risk of HCC (290). It is important to note
that currently metabolic surgery is not
indicated solely for treatment of MASH.
Given that many individuals with MASH
have metabolic risks (type 2 diabetes
and obesity) that are indications for met-
abolic surgery, the improvement in liver
health is expected, but surgical indication
should follow current practice guidelines.
Metabolic surgery should be used with
caution in individuals with compensated
cirrhosis (i.e., asymptomatic stage of cir-
rhosis without associated liver complica-
tions), but with experienced surgeons the
risk of hepatic decompensation is similar
to that for individuals with less advanced
liver disease. Because of the paucity of
safety and outcome data, metabolic sur-
gery is not recommended in individuals
with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e., cir-
rhosis stage with complications such as
variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic en-
cephalopathy, or jaundice) who also have
a much higher risk of postoperative devel-
opment of these liver-related complica-
tions (181,205,206).

Adults with type 2 diabetes and MASLD
are at an increased risk of CVD and
require comprehensive management of
cardiovascular risk factors (181,205,206).
Within an interprofessional approach,
statin therapy should be initiated or con-
tinued for cardiovascular risk reduction as
clinically indicated. Overall, its use appears
to be safe in adults with type 2 diabetes
and MASH, including in the presence of
compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A
or B cirrhosis) from MASLD. Some studies

even suggest that statin use in people
with chronic liver disease may reduce epi-
sodes of hepatic decompensation and/or
overall mortality (291,292). Statin therapy
is not recommended in decompensated
cirrhosis given limited safety and efﬁcacy
data (181,205,206).

Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Age-adjusted rates of obstructive sleep
apnea, a risk factor for CVD, are signiﬁ-
cantly higher (4- to 10-fold) with obesity,
especially with central obesity (293) (see
Section 5, “Facilitating Positive Health
Behaviors and Well-being to Improve
Health Outcomes”). The prevalence of ob-
structive sleep apnea in the population
with type 2 diabetes may be as high as
23%, and the prevalence of any sleep-di-
sordered breathing may be as high as 58%
(294,295). In participants with obesity en-
rolled in the Look AHEAD trial, the preva-
lence exceeded 80% (296). Obstructive
sleep apnea should be evaluated in indi-
viduals with suggestive symptoms (e.g.,
excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring,
and witnessed apnea) (297). Sleep apnea
treatment (lifestyle modiﬁcation, continu-
ous positive airway pressure, oral applian-
ces, and surgery) signiﬁcantly improves
quality of life and blood pressure man-
agement. Recently, two phase 3 random-
ized trials found that among adults with
obesity and moderate-to-severe obstruc-
tive sleep apnea but without diabetes,
treatment with the dual GIP and GLP-1
RA tirzepatide substantially reduced sleep
apnea severity (298). More research is
needed to determine the effects of GLP-1
and dual GIP and GLP-1 RAs on sleep ap-
nea in people with diabetes.

Pancreatitis
Diabetes is linked to diseases of the exo-
crine pancreas, such as pancreatitis, which
may disrupt the global architecture or
physiology of the pancreas, often resulting
in both exocrine and endocrine dysfunc-
tion. Up to half of individuals with diabetes
may have some degree of impaired exo-
crine pancreas function (299). People with
diabetes are at an approximately twofold
higher risk of developing acute pancreatitis
(300).

Conversely, prediabetes and/or diabe-
tes has been found to develop in approx-
imately one-third of individuals after an
episode of acute pancreatitis (301); thus,
the relationship is likely bidirectional.

Postpancreatitis diabetes may include ei-
ther new-onset disease or previously
unrecognized diabetes (302). Studies of
individuals treated with incretin-based
therapies for diabetes have also reported
that pancreatitis may occur more fre-
quently with these medications, but re-
sults have been mixed and causality has
not been established (303–306).

Islet autotransplantation should be
considered for individuals requiring total
pancreatectomy for medically refractory
chronic pancreatitis to prevent postsur-
gical diabetes. Approximately one-third
of individuals undergoing total pancrea-
tectomy with islet autotransplantation
are insulin free 1 year postoperatively,
and observational studies from different
centers have demonstrated islet graft
function up to a decade after the surgery
in some individuals (307–311). Both per-
sonal factors for the individual with dia-
betes and disease factors should be
carefully considered when deciding the
indications and timing of this surgery.
Surgeries should be performed in skilled
facilities that have demonstrated exper-
tise in islet autotransplantation.

Sensory Impairment
Hearing impairment, both in high-fre-
quency and low- to midfrequency ranges,
is more common in people with diabetes
than in those without, with stronger as-
sociations found in studies of younger
people (312). Proposed pathophysiologic
mechanisms include the combined contri-
butions of hyperglycemia and oxidative
stress with cochlear microangiopathy and
auditory neuropathy (313). In a National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) analysis, hearing impairment
was about twice as prevalent in people
with diabetes as in those without, after
adjusting for age and other risk factors for
hearing impairment (314). Low HDL cho-
lesterol, coronary heart disease, periph-
eral neuropathy, and general poor health
have been reported as risk factors for
hearing impairment for people with dia-
betes, but an association of hearing loss
with glycemia has not been consistently
observed (315). In the DCCT/EDIC cohort,
increases in the time-weighted mean A1C
was associated with increased risk of
hearing impairment when tested after
long-term (>20 years) follow-up, with ev-
ery 10% increase in A1C leading to 19%

high-frequency impairment (316). Impair-
ment in smell, but not taste, has also
been reported in individuals with diabe-
tes (317).
