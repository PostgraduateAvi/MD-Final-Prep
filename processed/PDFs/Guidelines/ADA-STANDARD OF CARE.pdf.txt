The American Diabetes Association (ADA) “Standards of Care in Diabetes” includes
the ADA’s current clinical practice recommendations and is intended to provide the
components of diabetes care, general treatment goals and guidelines, and tools to
evaluate quality of care. Members of the ADA Professional Practice Committee, an
interprofessional expert committee, are responsible for updating the Standards of
Care annually, or more frequently as warranted. For a detailed description of ADA
standards, statements, and reports, as well as the evidence-grading system for
ADA’s clinical practice recommendations and a full list of Professional Practice Com-
mittee members, please refer to Introduction and Methodology. Readers who wish
to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at professional.diabetes
.org/SOC.

Among hospitalized individuals, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glucose variability
are associated with adverse outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality
(1). Identiﬁcation and careful management of people with diabetes and dysglycemia
during hospitalization has direct and immediate beneﬁts. Diabetes management in
the inpatient setting is facilitated by identiﬁcation and treatment of hyperglycemia
prior to elective procedures, a dedicated inpatient diabetes management service ap-
plying validated standards of care, and a proactive transition plan for outpatient dia-
betes care with timely scheduled follow-up appointments. These steps can improve
outcomes, shorten hospital stays, and reduce the need for readmission and emer-
gency department visits. For older hospitalized individuals or for people with diabe-
tes in long-term care facilities, please see Section 13, “Older Adults.”

HOSPITAL CARE DELIVERY STANDARDS

Recommendations
16.1 Perform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (ran-
dom blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if
no A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months. B
16.2 Institutions should implement protocols using validated written or com-
puterized provider order entry sets for management of dysglycemia in the
hospital that allow for a personalized approach. B

Considerations on Admission
High-quality hospital care for diabetes requires clear and actionable standards for care
delivery, which are best implemented using structured order sets and quality improve-
ment strategies for process improvement. Unfortunately, “best practice” protocols,

reviews, and guidelines are inconsistently
implemented within hospitals (2). To cor-
rect this, medical centers striving for opti-
mal inpatient diabetes treatment should
establish protocols and structured order
sets, which include computerized pro-
vider order entry (CPOE). Institutions are
encouraged to perform audits regularly
to monitor proper use and institute edu-
cational/training programs to update staff
on an ongoing basis.

Initial evaluation should state the type
of diabetes (i.e., type 1, type 2, gestational,
pancreatogenic, stress hyperglycemia, drug
related, or nutrition related [e.g., enteral or
parenteral nutrition]) when it is known. Be-
cause inpatient treatment and discharge
planning are more effective when pread-
mission glycemia is considered, A1C should
be measured for all people with diabetes
or dysglycemia admitted to the hospital if
no A1C test result is available from the
previous 3 months (3,4). In addition, dia-
betes self-management knowledge and
behaviors should be assessed on admis-
sion, and diabetes self-management edu-
cation should be provided throughout
the hospital stay, especially if a new treat-
ment plan is being considered. Diabetes
self-management education should include
the knowledge and skills needed after
discharge, such as medication dosing and
administration, glucose monitoring, and
recognition and treatment of hypoglyce-
mia (5). Evidence supports preadmission
treatment of hyperglycemia in people
scheduled for elective surgery as an ef-
fective means of reducing adverse out-
comes (6,7).

The National Academy of Medicine rec-
ommends CPOE to prevent medication-
related errors and to increase medication
administration efﬁciency (8). Systematic
reviews of randomized controlled trials us-
ing computerized assistance to improve
glycemic outcomes in the hospital found
signiﬁcant improvement in the percent-
age of time individuals spent in the glyce-
mic goal range, lower mean blood glucose
levels, and no increase in hypoglycemia
(9). Where feasible, there should be struc-
tured order sets that provide computer-
ized guidance for glycemic management.
Insulin dosing algorithms using machine
learning and data in the electronic health
record (EHR) currently in development
show promise for predicting insulin re-
quirements during hospitalization (10,11).

Diabetes Care Specialists in the
Hospital

Recommendation
16.3 When caring for hospitalized
people with diabetes (with an existing
or new diagnosis) or stress hypergly-
cemia, consult with a specialized dia-
betes or glucose management team
when available. B

Care provided by appropriately trained
specialists or specialty teams may reduce
the length of stay and improve glycemic
and other clinical outcomes (12–14). In
addition, the increased risk of 30-day re-
admission following hospitalization that
has been attributed to diabetes can be
reduced, and costs saved, when inpatient
care is provided by a specialized diabetes
management team (12,15,16). In a cross-
sectional study comparing usual care to
specialists reviewing diabetes cases and
making recommendations virtually through
the EHR, rates of both hyperglycemia and
hypoglycemia were reduced by 30–40%
(17). Providing diabetes self-management
education and developing a diabetes dis-
charge plan that includes continued ac-
cess to diabetes medications and supplies
and ongoing education and support are
key strategies to improve long-term out-
comes (18,19). Details of diabetes care
team composition and other resources
are available from the Joint Commission
accreditation program for the hospital
care of diabetes, the Society of Hospital
Medicine workbook, and the Joint British
Diabetes Societies (JBDS) for Inpatient
Care Group (20–22).

GLYCEMIC GOALS IN
HOSPITALIZED ADULTS

Recommendations
16.4a Insulin should be initiated or
intensiﬁed for treatment of persistent
hyperglycemia starting at a threshold
of $180 mg/dL ($10.0 mmol/L)
(conﬁrmed on two occasions within
24 h) for the majority of critically ill
individuals (those in the intensive care
unit [ICU]). A
16.4b Insulin and/or other glucose-
lowering therapies should be initiated
or intensiﬁed for treatment of persis-
tent hyperglycemia starting at a thresh-
old of $180 mg/dL ($10.0 mmol/L)
(conﬁrmed on two occasions within
24 h) for the majority of noncritically
ill individuals (those not in the ICU). B

16.5a Once therapy is initiated, a
glycemic goal of 140–180 mg/dL
(7.8–10.0 mmol/L) is recommended
for most critically ill individuals (those
in the ICU) with hyperglycemia. A
More stringent individualized glyce-
mic goals may be appropriate for se-
lected critically ill
individuals if they
can be achieved without signiﬁcant
hypoglycemia. B
16.5b For noncritically ill
individu-
als (those not in the ICU), a glyce-
mic goal of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6-
10.0 mmol/L) is recommended if it
can be achieved without signiﬁcant
hypoglycemia. B

Standard Deﬁnitions of Glucose
Abnormalities
Hyperglycemia in hospitalized individu-
als is deﬁned as blood glucose levels
>140 mg/dL (>7.8 mmol/L) (23). An admis-
sion A1C value $6.5% ($48 mmol/mol)
suggests that the onset of diabetes pre-
ceded hospitalization (see Section 2,
“Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of Diabetes”).
Level 1 hypoglycemia is deﬁned as a
glucose concentration of 54–69 mg/dL
(3.0–3.8 mmol/L). Level 2 hypoglycemia
is deﬁned as a glucose concentration
<54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L), which is typi-
cally the threshold for neuroglycopenic
symptoms. Level 3 hypoglycemia is de-
ﬁned as a clinical event characterized by
altered mental and/or physical function-
ing that requires assistance from another
person for recovery (Table 6.4) (24,25).
Levels 2 and 3 require immediate interven-
tion and correction of low blood glucose.
Prompt treatment of level 1 hypoglycemia
is recommended for prevention of pro-
gression to more signiﬁcant level 2 and
level 3 hypoglycemia.

Glycemic Goals
In a landmark clinical trial conducted in a
surgical intensive care unit (ICU), Van den
Berghe et al. (26) demonstrated that an
intensive intravenous insulin protocol
with a glycemic goal of 80–110 mg/dL
(4.4–6.1 mmol/L) reduced mortality by
40% compared with a standard approach
of a glycemic goal of 180–215 mg/dL
(10–12 mmol/L) in critically ill hospitalized
individuals with diabetes and/or stress hy-
perglycemia and recent surgery. This study
provided evidence that active treatment

individuals could have immediate bene-
ﬁts. However, several multicenter studies,
including the Normoglycemia in Intensive
Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glu-
cose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR)
trial, in critically ill hospitalized individuals
in medical and surgical ICUs (27–29) led
to a reconsideration of the optimal glu-
cose lowering goal in critical illness. In
these trials, critically ill individuals ran-
domized to intensive glycemic manage-
ment (80–110 mg/dL [4.4–6.1 mmol/L])
derived no signiﬁcant treatment advan-
tage compared with a group with more
moderate glycemic goals (140–180 mg/dL
[7.8–10.0 mmol/L]) and had slightly but
signiﬁcantly higher mortality (27.5% vs.
25%). The intensively treated group had
10- to 15-fold greater rates of hypoglyce-
mia, which may have contributed to the
adverse outcomes noted. The ﬁndings
from the NICE-SUGAR trial, supported by
several meta-analyses and a randomized
controlled trial, showed higher rates of hy-
poglycemia and an increase in mortality
with more aggressive glycemic manage-
ment goals compared with moderate gly-
cemic goals (27,30,31). Based on these
results,
insulin and/or other therapies
should be initiated for the treatment of
persistent hyperglycemia $180 mg/dL
($10.0 mmol/L). Once therapy is initi-
ated, a glycemic goal of 140–180 mg/dL
(7.8–10.0 mmol/L) is recommended for
most critically ill individuals with hyper-
glycemia. Although not as well supported
by data from randomized controlled tri-
als, these recommendations have been
extended to hospitalized individuals without
critical illness. More stringent glycemic goals,
such as 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L),
may be appropriate for selected individ-
uals (e.g., critically ill individuals under-
going cardiac surgery) if they can be
achieved without signiﬁcant hypoglyce-
mia (32,33).

For inpatient management of hypergly-
cemia in noncritical care settings, a glycemic
goal of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L)
is recommended, whether it is hypergly-
cemia due to newly diagnosed diabetes
or stress hyperglycemia or hyperglycemia
related to diabetes prior to admission
(34). It has been found that fasting glu-
cose levels <100 mg/dL (<5.6 mmol/L)
are predictors of hypoglycemia within
the next 24 h (35). Glycemic levels up to
250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) may be accept-
able in selected populations (terminally ill
individuals with short life expectancy,

advanced kidney failure [and/or on dialy-
sis], high risk for hypoglycemia, and/or
labile glycemic excursions). In these indi-
viduals, less aggressive treatment goals
that would help avoid symptomatic hy-
poglycemia and/or hyperglycemia are
often appropriate. Clinical
judgment
combined with ongoing assessment of
clinical status, including changes in the
trajectory of glucose measures,
illness
severity, nutritional status, or concomi-
tant medications that might affect glu-
cose levels (e.g., glucocorticoids), may
be incorporated into the day-to-day deci-
sions regarding treatment goals.

GLUCOSE MONITORING
In hospitalized individuals with diabetes
who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood
glucose monitoring should be performed
before meals; in those not eating, glucose
monitoring is advised every 4–6 h (34).
More frequent POC blood glucose moni-
toring ranging from every 30 min to every
2 h is the required standard for safe use
of intravenous insulin therapy.

Hospital blood glucose monitoring
should be performed with U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved POC
hospital-calibrated glucose monitoring
systems (36). POC blood glucose meters
are not as accurate or as precise as labo-
ratory glucose analyzers, and capillary
blood glucose readings are subject to ar-
tifacts due to perfusion, edema, anemia/
erythrocytosis, and several medications
commonly used in the hospital
(36)
(Table 7.1). The FDA has established
standards for capillary (ﬁnger-stick) POC
glucose monitoring in the hospital (36).
The balance between analytic require-
ments (e.g., accuracy, precision, and inter-
ference) and clinical requirements (e.g.,
rapidity, simplicity, and POC) has not been
uniformly resolved (36–39), and most hos-
pitals have arrived at their own policies to
balance these parameters. It is critically
important that devices selected for in-
hospital use, and the workﬂow through
which they are applied, undergo careful
analysis of performance and reliability
and ongoing quality assessments (39). Re-
cent studies indicate that POC measures
provide adequate information for usual
practice, with only rare instances where
care has been compromised (37,38). Best
practice dictates that any glucose result
that does not correlate with the individu-
al’s clinical status should be conﬁrmed by

repeating the test ﬁrst and measuring a
sample in the clinical laboratory if the
second result is similar, particularly for
asymptomatic hypoglycemic events.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring

Recommendations
16.6 In people with diabetes using a
personal continuous glucose monitor-
ing (CGM) device, the use of CGM
should be continued during hospitali-
zation if clinically appropriate, with
conﬁrmatory point-of-care (POC) blood
glucose measurements for insulin dos-
ing decisions and hypoglycemia assess-
ment,
if resources and training are
available, and according to an institu-
tional protocol. B
16.7 Continue use of insulin pump
or automated insulin delivery in people
with diabetes who are hospitalized
when clinically appropriate, with conﬁr-
matory POC blood glucose measure-
ments for insulin dosing decisions and
hypoglycemia assessment and treat-
ment. This is contingent upon avail-
ability of necessary supplies, resources,
and training, ongoing competency
assessments, and implementation of
institutional diabetes technology pro-
tocols. C

Several studies have demonstrated that
inpatient use of continuous glucose moni-
toring (CGM) has advantages over POC
glucose monitoring in detecting hypogly-
cemia, particularly nocturnal, prolonged
and/or asymptomatic hypoglycemia
(40–42), and in reducing recurrent hy-
poglycemia (43,44). However, at
this
time, initiating use of a new CGM device
has not been approved by the FDA. During
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, many institutions used CGM in
ICU and non-ICU settings, with the aim of
minimizing exposure time and saving per-
sonal protective equipment, under an FDA
policy of enforcement discretion (45,46).
Data on the safety and efﬁcacy of real-
time CGM use in the hospital, particularly
with implementation of remote monitor-
ing (e.g., a glucose telemetry system), is
growing (44,46–49).

Continuation of personal CGM device
use, particularly for people with type 1 or
type 2 diabetes treated with intensive insulin
therapy and at increased risk for hypo-
glycemia during hospitalization, is rec-
ommended. Conﬁrmatory POC capillary

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

glucose monitoring, using hospital-cali-
brated glucose meters, is recommended for
insulin dosing and hypoglycemia assessment
(e.g., hybrid testing protocols) (42,46,50).
People with diabetes should be coun-
seled about meaningful use of trend
arrows and alarms and the importance
of notifying nursing staff for conﬁrmation
of these events with POC capillary glucose
monitoring. Similarly, continuation of auto-
mated insulin delivery systems should be
supported during hospitalization, when clin-
ically appropriate, and with proper staff
training and supervision (42,46). Obser-
vational studies have demonstrated im-
provements in patient satisfaction and
improved detection of glycemic excur-
sions (41,48). Consultation with the endo-
crinology/diabetes care team or diabetes
care and education specialists, if available,
is recommended, especially if the reason
for admission is suspected to be related
to device malfunction or lack of adequate
education/training or use. Hospitals are
encouraged to develop institutional poli-
cies and have the availability of trained
personnel with knowledge of diabetes
technology. Recent review articles pro-
vide details on accuracy,
interferences,
precautions, and contraindications of dia-
betes technology devices in the hospital
setting (49,51).

For more information on CGM, see

Section 7, “Diabetes Technology.”

GLUCOSE-LOWERING TREATMENT
IN HOSPITALIZED INDIVDIUALS
An individualized approach for glycemic
management is encouraged throughout
the hospital stay and should take into
consideration several predictive factors
for achieving glycemic goals, such as prior
home use and doses of insulin or noninsu-
lin therapy, expected level of insulin resis-
tance, prior A1C, current glucose levels,
oral intake, and duration of diabetes.

Insulin Therapy

Recommendations
16.8a Continuous intravenous insulin
infusion is recommended for achiev-
ing glycemic goals and avoiding hypo-
glycemia in critically ill individuals. A
16.8b Basal
insulin or a basal plus
bolus correction insulin plan is the
preferred treatment for noncritically
ill hospitalized individuals with poor
or no oral intake. A

16.9 An insulin plan with basal, pran-
dial, and correction components is
the preferred treatment
for most
noncritically ill hospitalized individuals
with adequate nutritional intake. A
16.10 For most individuals, sole use
of a correction or supplemental in-
sulin without basal insulin (formerly
referred to as a sliding scale) in the
inpatient setting is discouraged. A

Critical Care Setting
Continuous intravenous insulin infusion is
the most effective method for achieving
speciﬁc glycemic goals and avoiding hy-
poglycemia in the critical care setting. In-
travenous insulin infusions should be
administered using validated written or
computerized protocols that allow for
predeﬁned adjustments in the insulin in-
fusion rate based on glycemic ﬂuctua-
tions and immediate past and current
insulin infusion rates (52). For diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar state (HHS) management,
continuous intravenous insulin infusion
is given for correction of hyperglycemia,
hyperketonemia, and acid-base disorder
following a ﬁxed-rate intravenous insulin
infusion (53) or nurse-driven protocol
with a variable rate based on glucose val-
ues (54). Individuals with mild and un-
complicated DKA can be managed with
subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin doses
given every 1–2 h (55).

Noncritical Care Setting
In most instances, insulin is the preferred
treatment for hyperglycemia in hospital-
ized individuals. In certain circumstances,
it may be appropriate to continue home
oral glucose-lowering medications or initi-
ate use of agents such as dipeptidyl pepti-
dase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) (2,50). Several
reports indicate that inpatient use of insu-
lin pens is safe and may improve nurse
satisfaction when safety protocols, includ-
ing nursing education, are in place to
guarantee single-person use (56–58).

Outside of critical care units, scheduled
subcutaneous insulin orders are recom-
mended for the management of hyper-
glycemia in people with diabetes and
hyperglycemia. Use of insulin analogs or
human insulin results in similar glycemic
outcomes in the hospital setting, but regu-
lar insulin may increase the risk of hypogly-
cemic events (59). The use of subcutaneous
rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals,

or every 4–6 h if no meals are given or if
the individual is receiving continuous en-
teral or parenteral nutrition, is indicated
to correct or prevent hyperglycemia. Basal
insulin, or a basal plus bolus correction
schedule, is the preferred treatment for
noncritically ill hospitalized individuals
with inadequate or restricted oral intake.
An insulin schedule with basal, prandial,
and correction components is the pre-
ferred treatment for most noncritically ill
hospitalized people with diabetes with
adequate nutritional intake.

A randomized controlled trial has
shown that basal plus bolus treatment
improved glycemic outcomes and re-
duced hospital complications compared
with a correction or supplemental insulin
without basal insulin (formerly known as
sliding scale) for people with type 2 dia-
betes admitted for general surgery (60).
Prolonged use of correction or supple-
insulin is
insulin without basal
mental
strongly discouraged in the inpatient set-
ting, with the exception of that for peo-
ple with type 2 diabetes in noncritical
care with mild hyperglycemia or stress
hyperglycemia (61,62).

A prospective randomized inpatient
study of 70/30 intermediate-acting (NPH)/
regular insulin mixture versus basal-
bolus therapy showed comparable glyce-
mic outcomes but signiﬁcantly increased
hypoglycemia in the group receiving the
insulin mixture (63). Therefore, insulin mix-
tures such as 75/25, 70/30, or 50/50 insu-
lins are not routinely recommended for in-
hospital use.

Data on the use of glargine U-300 and
degludec U-100 or U-200 in the inpatient
and perioperative settings are limited. A
few studies have shown that they demon-
strated similar efﬁcacy and safety com-
pared with glargine U-100 (64–66).

Type 1 Diabetes
For people with type 1 diabetes, dosing
insulin based solely on premeal glucose
levels does not account for basal insulin
requirements or caloric intake and in-
creases the risk of both hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia (67). Typically, basal insulin
dosing is based on body weight and ex-
pected sensitivity to insulin, and there is
some evidence that people with renal in-
sufﬁciency should be treated with lower
insulin doses (68,69). An insulin schedule
with basal and correction components is
necessary for all hospitalized individuals
with type 1 diabetes, even for those

taking nothing by mouth, with the addi-
tion of prandial insulin when individuals
are eating. Policies and best practice
alerts in the EHR should be put in place to
ensure that basal insulin (given subcuta-
neously, via insulin pump or by insulin in-
fusion) is not held for people with type 1
diabetes, especially during care transi-
tions, and that ongoing prescriber and
nursing education is provided (57).

Transitioning From Intravenous to
Subcutaneous Insulin
When discontinuing intravenous insulin,
a transition protocol
is recommended,
as it is associated with less morbidity
and lower costs. Subcutaneous basal in-
sulin should be given 2 h before intrave-
nous infusion is discontinued, with the
aim of minimizing rebound hyperglyce-
mia while the subcutaneous insulin ac-
tion rises (70,71).

Emerging data from studies in people
with hyperglycemia with and without DKA
show that the administration of a low
dose (0.15–0.3 units/kg) of basal insulin
analog in addition to intravenous insulin
infusion may reduce the duration of insulin
infusion and length of hospital stay and
prevent rebound hyperglycemia without
increased risk of hypoglycemia (72–74).

For transitioning, the total daily dose of
subcutaneous insulin may be calculated
based on the insulin infusion rate during
the prior 6–8 h when stable glycemic goals
were achieved, based on prior home insu-
lin dose, or following a weight-based ap-
proach (70). For people being transitioned
to concentrated insulin (U-200, U-300, or
U-500) in the inpatient setting, it is impor-
tant to ensure correct dosing by using a
separate insulin pen or vial for each indi-
vidual and by meticulous pharmacy and
nursing supervision of the dose adminis-
tered (64–66,75).

Noninsulin Therapies

Recommendation
16.11 For people with type 2 diabe-
tes hospitalized with heart failure, it
is recommended that use of a sodium–
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor be
initiated or continued during hospital-
ization and upon discharge, if there
are no contraindications and after re-
covery from the acute illness. A

The safety and efﬁcacy of noninsulin
glucose-lowering therapies in the hospital

setting has recently expanded (2,50,
76–78). A randomized trial and an ob-
servational study have demonstrated
the safety and efﬁcacy of DPP-4i in spe-
ciﬁc groups of hospitalized people with
diabetes (79,80). The use of DPP-4i with
or without basal insulin may be a safer and
simpler plan for people with mild to mod-
erate hyperglycemia on admission (e.g., ad-
mission glucose <180–200 mg/dL), with
reduced risk of hypoglycemia (2,80,81).
However, the FDA states that health care
professionals should consider discontinu-
ing saxagliptin and alogliptin in people
who develop heart failure (82). Data on
the inpatient use of glucagon-like peptide 1
receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are still
mostly limited to research studies and se-
lect populations that are medically stable
(77,78).

For people with type 2 diabetes hospi-
talized with heart failure,
it is recom-
mended that use of a sodium–glucose
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor be initi-
ated or continued during hospitalization
and upon discharge, if there are no con-
traindications and after recovery from
the acute illness (83,84). SGLT2 inhibitors
should be avoided in cases of severe ill-
ness, in people with ketonemia or keto-
nuria, and during prolonged fasting and
surgical procedures (85–88). Proactive ad-
justment of diuretic dosing is recom-
mended during hospitalization and/or
discharge, especially in collaboration with
a cardiology/heart failure consult team
(85–88). It is recommended that SGLT2
inhibitors should be stopped 3 days be-
fore scheduled surgeries (4 days for ertu-
gliﬂozin) (89).

HYPOGLYCEMIA

Recommendations
16.12 A hypoglycemia management
surveillance protocol should be adopted
by all health systems. A plan for identi-
fying, treating, and preventing hypogly-
cemia should be established for each
individual. Episodes of hypoglycemia in
the hospital should be documented in
the health record and tracked to inform
quality improvements. C
16.13 Treatment plans should be re-
viewed and changed as necessary to
prevent hypoglycemia and recurrent
hypoglycemia when a blood glucose
value of <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) is
documented. C

People with or without diabetes may ex-
perience hypoglycemia in the hospital
setting. While hypoglycemia is associ-
ated with increased mortality (90,91), in
many cases, it is a marker of an underly-
ing disease rather than the cause of fa-
tality. However, hypoglycemia is a severe
consequence of dysregulated metabo-
lism and/or diabetes treatment, and it is
imperative that it be minimized during
hospitalization. Many episodes of inpa-
tient hypoglycemia are preventable. A
hypoglycemia prevention and manage-
ment protocol should be adopted and
implemented by each hospital or hospi-
tal system. A standardized hospital-wide,
nurse-initiated hypoglycemia treatment
protocol should be in place to immediately
address blood glucose levels <70 mg/dL
(<3.9 mmol/L) (92,93). In addition, individ-
ualized plans for preventing and treating
hypoglycemia for each person should also
be developed. An American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (ADA) consensus statement rec-
ommends that an individual’s treatment
plan be reviewed any time a blood glucose
value of <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) occurs,
as this level often predicts subsequent
level 3 hypoglycemia (94). Episodes of hy-
poglycemia in the hospital should be
documented in the EHR and tracked (1).
A key strategy is embedding hypoglyce-
mia treatment into all insulin and insulin
infusion orders.

Inpatient Hypoglycemia: Risk
Factors, Treatment, and Prevention
Insulin is one of the most common medica-
tions that causes adverse events in hospi-
talized individuals. Errors in insulin dosing,
missed doses, and/or administration errors
including incorrect insulin type and/or
timing of dose occur relatively frequently
(95–97) and include prescriber (ordering),
pharmacy (dispensing), and nursing (ad-
ministration) errors. Common prevent-
able sources of iatrogenic hypoglyce-
mia are improper prescribing of other
glucose-lowering medications and inap-
propriate management and follow-up of
the ﬁrst episode of hypoglycemia (34).
Kidney failure is an important risk factor
for hypoglycemia in the hospital (98), pos-
sibly as a result of decreased insulin clear-
ance. Studies of “bundled” preventive
therapies, including proactive surveillance
of glycemic outliers and an interprofes-
sional data-driven approach to glycemic
management, showed that hypoglycemic
episodes in the hospital could be reduced

or prevented. Compared with baseline,
studies found that hypoglycemic events
decreased by 56–80% (93,99,100). The
Joint Commission, a global quality im-
provement and patient safety in health
care organization, recommends that all
hypoglycemic episodes be evaluated for
a root cause and the episodes be aggre-
gated and reviewed to address systemic
issues and possible solutions (21).

In addition to errors with insulin treat-
ment, iatrogenic hypoglycemia may occur
after a sudden reduction of corticosteroid
dose, reduced oral intake, emesis, inap-
propriate timing of short- or rapid-acting
insulin doses in relation to meals, reduced
infusion rate of intravenous dextrose, un-
expected interruption of enteral or paren-
teral feedings, delayed or missed blood
glucose checks, and altered ability of the
individual to report symptoms (101).

Recent inpatient studies show promise
for CGM to alert of impending hypoglyce-
mia, offering an opportunity to mitigate it
before it happens (42,46,48). The use of
personal CGM and automated insulin de-
livery devices, such as insulin pumps that
can automatically deliver correction doses
and change basal delivery rates in real
time, should be supported for ongoing
use during hospitalization for individuals
who are capable of operating their devices
safely and independently when proper
oversight supervision is available. Hospi-
tals should be encouraged to develop poli-
cies and protocols to support inpatient
use of individual- and hospital-owned di-
abetes technology and have expert staff
available for safe implementation and
evaluation of continued use during the
hospital stay (51). Hospital information
technology teams are beginning to inte-
grate CGM data into the EHR. The ability
to download and interpret diabetes de-
vice data during hospitalization can in-
form insulin dosing during hospitalization
and care transitions (42).

For more information on CGM, see

Section 7, “Diabetes Technology.”

Predicting and Preventing
Hypoglycemia
In people with diabetes, it is well established
that an episode of severe hypoglycemia in-
creases the risk for a subsequent event,
partly because of impaired counterregu-
lation (102). In a study of hospitalized in-
dividuals, 84% of people who had an
episode of severe hypoglycemia (deﬁned
as <40 mg/dL [<2.2 mmol/L]) had a

preceding episode of hypoglycemia
(<70 mg/dL [<3.9 mmol/L]) during the
same admission (103). In another study
of hypoglycemic episodes (deﬁned as
<50 mg/dL [<2.8 mmol/L]), 78% of indi-
viduals were taking basal
insulin, with
the incidence of hypoglycemia peaking
between midnight and 6:00 A.M. Despite
recognition of hypoglycemia, 75% of in-
dividuals did not have their dose of basal
insulin changed before the next basal in-
sulin administration (104). Several groups
have developed algorithms to predict epi-
sodes of hypoglycemia in the inpatient
setting (105,106). Models such as these
are potentially important and, once vali-
dated for general use, could provide a
valuable tool to reduce rates of hypogly-
cemia in the hospital. In one retrospective
cohort study, a fasting blood glucose of
<100 mg/dL was shown to be a predictor
of next-day hypoglycemia (35).

MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY IN
THE HOSPITAL
The goals of medical nutrition therapy in
the hospital are to provide adequate
calories to meet metabolic demands,
optimize glycemic outcomes, address
personal food preferences, and facili-
tate the creation of a discharge plan.
The ADA does not endorse any single
meal plan or speciﬁed percentages of
macronutrients. Current nutrition rec-
ommendations advise individualization
based on treatment goals, physiological
parameters, and medication use. Con-
trolled carbohydrate meal plans, where
the amount of carbohydrate on each
meal tray is calculated, are preferred by
many hospitals, as they facilitate matching
the prandial insulin dose to the amount of
carbohydrate given (107). Orders should
also indicate that the meal delivery and
nutritional insulin coverage should be co-
ordinated, as their variability often creates
the possibility of hyperglycemic and hypo-
glycemic events (18). Some hospitals offer
“meals on demand,” where individuals
may order meals from the menu at any
time during the day. This option improves
patient satisfaction but complicates glucose
monitoring–insulin–meal coordination and
can lead to insulin stacking if meals are too
close together. Finally, if the hospital food
service supports carbohydrate counting, this
option should be made available to people
with diabetes counting carbohydrates at

home, especially people wearing insulin
pumps (108,109).

SELF-MANAGEMENT IN THE
HOSPITAL
Diabetes self-management in the hospital
may be appropriate for select individuals
who wish to continue to perform self-care
while acutely ill (110–112). Candidates in-
clude children with parental supervision,
adolescents, and adults who successfully
perform diabetes self-management at
home and whose cognitive and physical
skills needed to successfully self-administer
insulin and perform glucose monitoring are
not compromised (5,42). In addition, they
should have adequate oral intake, be proﬁ-
cient in carbohydrate estimation, take mul-
tiple daily insulin injections or wear insulin
pumps, have stable insulin requirements,
and understand sick-day management. If
self-management is supported, a policy
should include a requirement that people
with diabetes and the care team agree on
a daily basis during hospitalization that
self-management is appropriate. Hospi-
tal personal medication policies may in-
clude guidance for people with diabetes
who wish to take their own or hospital-
dispensed insulin and noninsulin injectable
medications during their hospital stay. A
hospital policy for personal medication
may include a pharmacy exception on a
case-by-case basis as determined in con-
sultation with the care team. Pharmacy
must verify any home medication and re-
quire a prescriber order for the individual
to self-administer home or hospital-
dispensed medication under the supervi-
sion of the registered nurse. If an insulin
pump or CGM device is worn, hospital
policy and procedures delineating guide-
lines for wearing an insulin pump and/or
CGM device should be developed accord-
ing to consensus guidelines, including the
changing of insulin infusion sites and CGM
glucose sensors (42,113). As outlined in
Recommendations 7.31 and 7.32, people
with diabetes wearing diabetes devices
should be supported to continue them in
an inpatient setting if they are assessed
and deemed competent to perform self-
care and proper supervision is available.

Diabetes Care in the Hospital

S327

the insulin orders should include cover-
age of basal, prandial, and correctional
needs (108,114,115). It is essential that
people with type 1 diabetes continue to
receive basal insulin even if feedings are
discontinued.

Most adults receiving basal

insulin
should continue with their basal dose,
while the insulin dose for the total daily
nutritional component may be calculated
as 1 unit of insulin for every 10–15 g of car-
bohydrate in the enteral and parenteral
formulas. Commercially available cans of
enteral nutrition contain variable amounts
of carbohydrates and may be infused at
different rates (109).

All of this must be considered when
calculating insulin doses to cover the nu-
tritional component of enteral nutrition
(109). Giving NPH insulin two or three
times daily (every 8 or 12 h) or regular
insulin every 6 h to cover individual re-
quirements are reasonable options. Ad-
justments in insulin doses should be made
frequently. Correctional insulin should also
be administered subcutaneously every
6 h with regular human insulin or rapid-
acting insulin every 4 h. If enteral nutri-
tion is interrupted, a dextrose infusion
should be started immediately to prevent
hypoglycemia and to allow time to deter-
mine more appropriate insulin doses.

For adults receiving enteral bolus feed-
ings, approximately 1 unit of regular hu-
man insulin or rapid-acting insulin per
every 10–15 g of carbohydrate should be
given subcutaneously before each feeding.
To mitigate any hyperglycemia, correctional
insulin should be added as needed before
each feeding.

In individuals receiving nocturnal tube
feeding, NPH insulin administered along
with the initiation of the feeding to
cover this nutritional load is a reason-
able approach.

For individuals receiving continuous
peripheral or central parenteral nutrition,
human regular insulin may be added to
the solution, particularly if >20 units of
correctional insulin have been required in
the past 24 h. A starting dose of 1 unit of
regular human insulin for every 10 g of
dextrose has been recommended (1,108)
and should be adjusted daily in the solu-
tion. Adding insulin to the parenteral nu-
trition bag is the safest way to prevent
hypoglycemia if the parenteral nutrition is
stopped or interrupted. Correctional insu-
lin should be administered subcutane-
ously to address any hyperglycemia.

Because continuous enteral or parenteral
nutrition results in a continuous postpran-
dial state, efforts to bring blood glucose
levels to below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
substantially increase the risk of hypogly-
cemia in these individuals. For full enteral
and parenteral feeding guidance, please
refer to randomized controlled trials detail-
ing this topic (114,116,117).

Glucocorticoid Therapy
The prevalence of consistent use of glu-
cocorticoid therapy in hospitalized indi-
viduals can approach 10–15%, and these
medications can induce hyperglycemia
in 56–86% of these individuals with and
without preexisting diabetes (118,119).
If left untreated, this hyperglycemia in-
creases mortality and morbidity risk, e.g.,
infections and cardiovascular events. Glu-
cocorticoid type and duration of action
must be considered in determining appro-
priate insulin treatments. Daily-ingested
intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such
as prednisone reach peak plasma levels in
4–6 h (120) but have pharmacologic ac-
tions that can last throughout the day.
When monitored by CGM, the typical gly-
cemic pattern for individuals treated with
daily prednisone or prednisolone, admin-
istered in the morning, is characterized
by normal or mild fasting hyperglycemia,
with trends of increasing hyperglycemia
during the afternoon, and peaking in the
evening. These hyperglycemic excursions
are more pronounced in individuals with
type 2 diabetes than in those without dia-
betes (121).

For individuals treated with once- or
twice-daily steroids, administering NPH
insulin with prednisone or prednisolone
dosing is a standard approach, aimed at
matching the NPH actions with the steroid-
induced hyperglycemic response. NPH may
be administered in addition to daily basal-
bolus insulin or in addition to oral glucose-
lowering medications, depending on the
type of diabetes and recent diabetes
medication prior to starting steroids (122).
Because NPH action peaks about 4–6 h
after administration, it is recommended
that it be administered concomitantly
with intermediate-acting steroids (123).
For long-acting glucocorticoids such as
dexamethasone and multidose or contin-
uous glucocorticoid use, long-acting basal
insulin may be required to manage fast-
ing blood glucose levels (50). For higher
doses of glucocorticoids, increasing doses

of prandial (if eating) and correction insu-
lin, sometimes as much as 40–60% or
more, are often needed in addition to basal
insulin (124,125). A retrospective study
found that increasing the ratio of insulin to
steroids was positively associated with im-
proved time in range (70–180 mg/dL
[3.9–10.0 mmol/L]); however, there was
an increase in hypoglycemia (118). If insu-
lin orders are initiated, daily adjustments
based on levels of glycemia and antici-
pated changes in type, dosages, and dura-
tion of glucocorticoids, along with POC
blood glucose monitoring, are critical to re-
ducing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

Perioperative Care
It is estimated that up to 20% of individu-
als undergoing general surgery have dia-
betes, and 23–60% have prediabetes or
undiagnosed diabetes. Surgical stress and
counterregulatory hormone release in-
crease the risk of hyperglycemia as well
as mortality, infection, and length of stay
(109,126,127). There is little data avail-
able to guide care of people with diabetes
through the perioperative period. To re-
duce surgical risk in these individuals,
some institutions (126,128,129) have A1C
cutoffs for elective surgeries, and some
have developed optimization programs to
lower A1C prior to surgery (126,128–130).
The following approaches (126,128,130)

may be considered:

1. A preoperative risk assessment should
be performed for people with diabe-
tes who are at high risk for ischemic
heart disease and those with auto-
nomic neuropathy or renal failure.
2. The A1C goal for elective surgeries
should be <8% (<64.0 mmol/L) when-
ever possible.

3. The blood glucose goal in the periop-
erative period should be 100–180 mg/
dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) (126) within 4
h of the surgery. CGM should not be
used alone for glucose monitoring
during surgery (129).

4. Metformin should be held on the

day of surgery.

5. SGLT2 inhibitors should be discon-
tinued 3–4 days before surgery.
6. Other oral glucose-lowering agents
should be held the morning of sur-
gery or procedure.

7. Insulin dose reductions

include
NPH insulin to one-half of the dose
or long-acting basal insulin analogs

to 75–80% of the dose or adjust-
ment of insulin pump (if not in auto-
mated mode) basal rates based on
the type of diabetes and clinical
judgment (see Section 7, “Diabetes
Technology”).

8. Monitor blood glucose at least every
2–4 h while the individual takes noth-
ing by mouth and administer short-
or rapid-acting insulin as needed.
9. Stricter peioperative glycemic goals are
not advised, as perioperative glyce-
mic goals stricter than 80–180 mg/dL
(4.4–10.0 mmol/L) may not improve
outcomes and are associated with in-
creased hypoglycemia (128).

10. Compared with usual dosing, a reduc-
insulin dose
tion of 25% of basal
given the evening before surgery is
more likely to achieve perioperative
blood glucose goals with a lower risk
for hypoglycemia (131).

11. In individuals undergoing noncardiac
general surgery, basal insulin plus pre-
meal short- or
rapid-acting insulin
(basal-bolus) coverage has been associ-
ated with improved glycemic outcomes
and lower rates of perioperative com-
plications compared with the reactive,
correction-only short- or rapid-acting
insulin coverage alone with no basal in-
sulin dosing (60,126).

12. There is little data on the safe use
and/or inﬂuence of GLP-1 RAs on gly-
cemia and delayed gastric emptying
in the perioperative period. With in-
creasing use of GLP-1 RA and dual
glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA med-
ications for diabetes and/or weight
loss, there are concerns about the
safety of these drugs in the perioper-
ative period. These drugs may be as-
sociated with nausea, vomiting, and
delayed gastric emptying and have
the potential to increase the risk of
pulmonary aspiration during general
anesthesia and deep sedation. The
American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists
recommends holding GLP-1
RAs on the day of the procedure or
surgery for daily dose agents and for
at least 7 days prior to the proce-
dures or surgery for once-weekly
dose agents (132).

Despite the safety concerns around the
use of GLP-1 RA and dual GIP and GLP-1
RA drugs in the perioperative setting,
there is a need for guidance for individ-
risk assessment and mitigation
ual

strategies. While waiting for more deﬁn-
itive evidence, an interprofessional and
personalized approach for perioperative
management of
individuals taking a
GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is
suggested. Factors such as the primary
indication of these medications (e.g., di-
abetes or weight loss), current glycemic
management, type of surgery or proce-
dure and its urgency, type of anesthesia,
consideration of preoperative gastric ul-
trasound to quantify gastric contents, and
implementation of full stomach precau-
tions will determine an individualized ap-
proach based on clinical
If
worsening of glycemic outcomes due to
holding a GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-
1 RA is anticipated, an alternative strategy
for perioperative glycemic management
(e.g., insulin) should be considered.

judgement.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis and
Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State

Recommendations
16.14 Manage diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmo-
lar state (HHS) by administering intra-
venous ﬂuids, insulin, and electrolytes
(Fig. 16.1) and by closely monitoring
during treatment, ensuring timely and
bridged transition to maintenance sub-
cutaneous insulin administration, and
identifying and treating the precipitat-
ing cause. A
16.15 The discharge planning process
should include education on the recog-
nition, prevention, and management
of DKA and/or HHS for all individuals
affected by or at high risk for these
events to prevent recurrence and re-
admission. B

There is considerable variability in the
presentation of DKA and HHS, including
euglycemic DKA (deﬁned as plasma glu-
cose levels <200 mg/dL [<11.1 mmol/L]
in the presence of ketosis and metabolic
acidosis), mild to moderate hyperglyce-
mia and acidosis, or severe hyperglyce-
mia, dehydration, and coma; therefore,
individualization of treatment based on a
careful clinical and laboratory assessment
is needed (70,73,133,134).

Management goals include restoration
of circulatory volume and tissue perfusion,
resolution of ketoacidosis, and correction
of electrolyte imbalance and acidosis. It is
also essential to treat any correctable un-
derlying cause of DKA, such as sepsis,

myocardial infarction, or stroke. In criti-
cally ill and mentally obtunded individuals
with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous
insulin is the standard of care. Successful
transition from intravenous to subcutane-
ous insulin requires administration of
basal insulin 2–4 h before the intravenous
insulin is stopped to prevent recurrence
of ketoacidosis and rebound hyperglyce-
mia while the subcutaneous insulin action
rises (71,133,135). Studies have reported
that the administration of a low dose of
basal insulin analog in addition to intrave-
nous insulin infusion may prevent re-
bound hyperglycemia without increased
risk of hypoglycemia (72–74,133). There is
no signiﬁcant difference in outcomes for
intravenous human regular insulin versus
subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when
combined with aggressive ﬂuid manage-
ment for treating mild or moderate DKA
(136). Individuals with uncomplicated DKA
may sometimes be treated with subcuta-
neous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the
emergency department or step-down units
(137). This approach may be safer and
more cost-effective than treatment with in-
travenous insulin. If subcutaneous insulin
administration is used, it is important to
provide an adequate ﬂuid replacement,
frequent POC blood glucose monitoring,
treatment of any concurrent infections,
and appropriate follow-up to avoid recur-
rent DKA. Several studies have shown that
the use of bicarbonate in people with DKA
made no difference in the resolution of aci-
dosis or time to discharge, and its use is
generally not recommended (138). For fur-
ther treatment information and in-depth
review, refer to the recently updated ADA
consensus report (70).

TRANSITION FROM THE HOSPITAL
TO THE AMBULATORY SETTING

Recommendation
16.16 A structured discharge plan
should be tailored to the individual
with diabetes. B

A structured discharge plan tailored to
the individual may reduce the length of
hospital stay and readmission rates and
increase satisfaction with the hospital
experience (139,140). Multiple strate-
including diabetes self-
gies are key,
management education prior to discharge,
diabetes medication reconciliation with at-
tention to access, and scheduled virtual

and/or face-to-face follow-up visits after
discharge. Discharge planning should begin
at admission and be updated as individual
needs change (141,142). Individualization
and shared decision-making is key when
creating a safe and effective discharge plan.
The transition from the acute care set-
ting presents risks for all people with dia-
betes. Individuals may be discharged to
varied settings, including home (with or
without visiting nurse services), assisted
living, rehabilitation, or skilled nursing fa-
cilities. For individuals discharged to home
or assisted living, the optimal discharge
plan will need to consider diabetes type
and severity, effects of the illness on blood
glucose levels, and the individual’s cir-
cumstances, capabilities, and preferen-
ces (19,143,144). See Section 13, “Older
Adults,” for more information.

An outpatient follow-up visit with pri-
mary care, endocrinology, or a diabetes
care and education specialist within 1
month of discharge is advised for all indi-
viduals experiencing hyperglycemia and/or
hypoglycemia in the hospital. If glycemic
management medications are changed or
glucose management is not optimal at
discharge, an earlier appointment (in 1–2
weeks) is preferred, and frequent contact

to consider therapy adjustments may be
needed to avoid hyperglycemia and hypo-
glycemia. A discharge algorithm for glyce-
mic medication adjustment, based on
admission A1C, diabetes medications be-
fore admission, and insulin usage during
hospitalization was found useful to guide
treatment decisions and signiﬁcantly im-
prove A1C after discharge (4).

Clear communication with outpatient
health care professionals directly or via
hospital discharge summaries facilitates
safe transitions to outpatient care. Provid-
ing information regarding the root cause of
hyperglycemia (or the plan for determining
the cause), related complications and co-
morbidities, and recommended treatments
can assist outpatient health care professio-
nals as they assume ongoing care.

The Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality recommends that, at a mini-
mum, discharge plans include the follow-
ing (145):

Medication Reconciliation
(cid:129) Home and hospital medications must
be cross-checked to ensure that no
chronic medications are stopped and
to ensure the safety of new and old
prescriptions.

(cid:129) Prescriptions for new or changed medi-
cation should be ﬁlled and reviewed
with the individual and care partners at
or before discharge whenever possible.

Structured Discharge
Communication

(cid:129) Information on medication changes,
pending tests and studies, and follow-up
needs must be accurately and promptly
communicated to outpatient health
care professionals.

(cid:129) Discharge summaries should be trans-
mitted to the primary care health care
professional as soon as possible after
discharge.

(cid:129) Scheduling follow-up appointments
prior to discharge with people with di-
abetes agreeing to the time and place
increases the likelihood that they will
attend.

It is recommended that the following
areas of knowledge be reviewed and ad-
dressed before hospital discharge:

(cid:129) Identiﬁcation of the health care pro-
fessionals who will provide diabetes
care after discharge.

S330 Diabetes Care in the Hospital

Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025

(cid:129) Level of understanding related to the
diabetes diagnosis, glucose monitoring,
home glucose goals, and when to call
a health care professional.

(cid:129) Deﬁnition, recognition, treatment, and
prevention of hyperglycemia and
hypoglycemia.

(cid:129) Information on choosing healthy food
at home and referral to an outpatient
registered dietitian nutritionist or dia-
betes care and education specialist
to guide individualization of the meal
plan, if needed.

(cid:129) When and how to take blood glu-
cose-lowering medications, including
insulin administration and noninsulin
injectables.

(cid:129) Sick-day management (19,144).
(cid:129) Proper use and disposal of diabetes
supplies, e.g., insulin pens, pen nee-
dles, syringes, glucose meters, and
lancets.

People with diabetes must be provided
with appropriate durable medical equip-
ment, medications, supplies (e.g., blood
glucose test strips or CGM sensors), pre-
scriptions, and appropriate education at
the time of discharge to avoid a poten-
tially dangerous hiatus in care.

PREVENTING ADMISSIONS AND
READMISSIONS
In people with diabetes, the hospital re-
admission rate is between 14% and 20%,
which is nearly twice that in people with-
out diabetes (141,146). This may result
in increased diabetes distress and has sig-
niﬁcant ﬁnancial implications. Of people
with diabetes who are hospitalized, 30%
have two or more hospital stays, and
these admissions account for over 50% of
hospital costs for diabetes (147). Factors
contributing to readmission include male
sex, longer duration of prior hospitaliza-
tion, number of previous hospitalizations,
number and severity of comorbidities,
and lower socioeconomic and/or educa-
tional status; factors that may reduce re-
admission rates include scheduled home
health visits and timely ambulatory
follow-up care (141,146). While there is
no standardized protocol to prevent read-
missions,
strategies
have been reported that identify high-risk
individuals and offer some possible solu-
tions (141). To prevent readmissions, moni-
tor
individuals
admitted with A1C >9% (>75 mmol/

insulin adjustments

successful

several

for

mol) (148) or DKA (149,150) and follow a
transitional care model (151). For individuals
hospitalized with severe hypoglycemia, im-
paired awareness of hypoglycemia, or high
risk for hypoglycemia (end-stage kidney
disease,
intensive insulin management,
frailty, etc.), consider prescribing glucagon
to treat any future severe hypoglycemia
events (152,153). For people with diabetes
and chronic kidney disease, collaborative
person-centered medical homes may de-
crease risk-adjusted readmission rates
(154). Since recent studies have shown
that use of CGM may prevent emergency
department visits and hospital admission
in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes,
it may be beneﬁcial to initiate CGM just
prior to discharge to facilitate follow-up
and possibly prevent acute diabetes-re-
lated complications and readmission
(155).

Age is also an important risk factor in
hospitalization and readmission among
people with diabetes (refer to Section 13,
“Older Adults,” for detailed criteria). Suc-
cessful proactive care transitions from in-
patient to outpatient is a key strategy for
preventing readmission and emergency
department visits.

THE FUTURE
Inpatient diabetes management is chal-
lenging for hospitals, health care profes-
sionals, and people with diabetes, as
acute illness increases the risk of both hy-
poglycemia and hyperglycemia. The use
of decision support tools and best prac-
tice advisories in the EHR has facilitated
health care professionals following the
recommendations in this standard of care.
In addition, personal and hospital-owned
diabetes devices and dosing algorithms
are changing the way we provide care. Fu-
ture enhancements will likely continue to
improve the quality of care we deliver in
hospitals and in transitions from inpatient
to outpatient.
