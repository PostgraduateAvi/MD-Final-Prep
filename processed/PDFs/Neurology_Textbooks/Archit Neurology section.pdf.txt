Pyramidal drift describes a tendency for the hand to move upward and supinate if the hands are
held outstretched in a pronated position (palms downward), or to pronate downward if the hands
are held in supination.
Cerebellar drift is generally upward with excessive rebound movements if the hand is suddenly
displaced downward by the examiner.
Parietal drift is an outward movement on displacing the ulnar border of the supinated hand.

GENERAL FORMAT

Nature of Disease

•

•

Onset:  Sudden/acute/subacute/chronic  (sudden—vascular,  acute—demyelinating,  subacute—
infections/space occupying lesions, chronic—degenerative)
Deficit: 
disturbance/movement disorders.

Monoplegia/hemiplegia/quadriplegia/paraplegia/nerve 

palsies/ataxia/sensory

Site of Involvement of Nervous System

•
•

Upper motor neuron disease—intracranial (brain or cerebellum) or extracranial (spinal cord)
Lower  motor  neuron  disease—anterior  horn  cell  disease,  radiculopathies,  neuropathies,
neuromuscular junction diseases, and myopathies.

FOR CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT

Sudden onset, right-sided dense hemiplegia with right upper motor neuron (UMN) facial palsy due
to  cerebrovascular  accident  possible  thrombotic  in  etiology  with  site  of  lesion  being  left  internal
capsule, possible involving the lenticulostriate branch of middle cerebral artery (MCA). Patient is in
state of neuronal shock. Patient has following risk factors _____.

FOR NEUROPATHY

Acute  onset  of  symmetrical  flaccid  quadriplegia  (ascending)  with  no  evidence  of  sensory,  bowel,
bladder involvement with bilateral lower motor neuron (LMN) facial palsy, possible site of lesion in
the  peripheral  nerve,  pathology  being  demyelination—acute 
inflammatory  demyelinating
polyneuropathy (AIDP).

FOR SPINAL CORD DISEASE

Subacute onset of symmetrical spastic paraplegia with involvement of sensory, bladder, and bowel;
with  no  involvement  of  cranial  nerves  with  vertebral  tenderness  at  T4-5,  possible  site  of  lesion  is
spinal cord, the disease being compressive myelopathy.

Possible etiology: Tuberculosis—Pott’s spine.

FOR EXTRAPYRAMIDAL (PARKINSON’S DISEASE)

Insidious onset, slowly progressive, degenerative disease involving the motor system (in the form of
rigidity  and  tremors)  with  no  evidence  of  sensory,  cranial  nerves  or  bowel,  bladder,  we  would
consider  involvement  of  extrapyramidal  system  probably  parkinsonism  with  no  evidence  of
secondary causes, no signs or symptoms of Parkinson’s plus syndromes, functional status—Stage
III (Hoehn and Yahr staging system).

FOR ATAXIA

Insidious onset, slowly progressive, symmetrical ataxia and cerebellar signs of trunk and limbs with
no  evidence  of  sensory,  cranial  nerve  or  autonomic  involvement.  I  would  like  to  consider  the
possibility of degenerative cerebellar ataxia possibly inherited (family history +ve).

C. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: DISCUSSION ON CARDINAL SYMPTOMS

DISCUSSION ON CARDINAL SYMPTOMS

Taking a Neurological History

The  neurological  history  should  be  a  focused,  goal-directed  exercise  that  seeks  to  answer  the
following questions:
1.

Which  part  of  the  nervous  system  is  affected  by  “a  pathological  process”  and  is  causing  the
symptoms  (where  is  the  lesion)?  Is  it  a  single  lesion  or  are  there  multiple  diffuse  lesions?
Alternatively, is there a diffuse problem affecting many neurological systems?
What is the underlying pathological process (e.g. vascular, inflammatory, degenerative)?
Is this a purely neurological problem or a neurological manifestation of a systemic disease?

2.
3.

Note:
•
•

Ask the patient to tell their story in their own words
Explore  each  symptom  in  detail,  evaluating  the  evolution  and  the  way  the  symptoms  affect  the
ability to function
Ask for an eyewitness account when cognition or consciousness is involved
If  you  cannot  make  a  neurological  diagnosis,  take  the  history  again  before  arranging
investigations.

Weakness

Distribution of Weakness
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Is it symmetrical/asymmetric?
Plegia—complete loss of power—0/5 vs paresis—incomplete loss of power
One limb: Monoparesis.
Two limbs, same side: Hemiparesis.
Both lower limbs: Paraparesis.
All four limbs: Quadriparesis (or tetraparesis).
Pentaplegia  is  a  spinal  cord  injury  at  or  above  C4  level,  resulting  in  complete  loss  of  motor
functions below the injury level and paralysis of respiratory muscles.

Two (contralateral to each other) or three limbs (upper and lower limbs), e.g. right upper limb and
left lower limb or left arm and both legs, both arms and one leg.
Patterned weakness:

•

•

–

The  pattern  of  pyramidal  weakness  is  weakness  of  upper  limbs  extensors  and  lower  limbs
flexors.

For example: Right MCA territory embolic infarct—history of sudden onset, complete loss of power
in left upper limb, lower limb associated with left UMN facial palsy. Weakness—maximum at onset,
nonprogressive.

Variation  throughout  day—fatigability:  In  postsynaptic  neuromuscular  junction  disorders  like
myasthenia gravis the weakness worsens on exertion.
Wasting/loss  of  muscle  bulk—wasting  is  a  feature  of  LMN  disease.  Florid  wasting  is  seen  in
motor  neuron  disease.  Usually  associated  with  fasciculations.  In  late  stages  of  UMN  disease
disuse atrophy may be seen.
 Wasting of muscles also results in undue prominence of underlying bones.
Stiffness of limbs—increased tone of the limbs resulting in stiffness and heaviness of limbs is a
characteristic feature of UMN disease. Patients may complain that the limbs are heavy as log of
wood in spasticity, while they may say that the limbs are floppy in LMN diseases.
Gait abnormalities: It may aid in the diagnosis.

Positive and Negative Symptoms

Suggestive of peripheral

Abnormal sensory symptoms can be divided into two categories: positive and negative.

Positive Symptoms
•

Altered  sensation  that  are  described  as  pricking,  bandlike,  lightning-like  shooting  feelings
(lancinations), aching, knifelike, burning, scarring, electrical. Such symptoms are often painful.
Positive phenomena usually result from trains of impulses generated at sites of lowered threshold
or heightened excitability along a peripheral or central sensory pathway.
Because positive phenomena represent excessive activity in sensory pathways, they may or may
not be associated with a sensory deficit (loss) on examination.

Negative Symptoms
•

Represent  loss  of  sensory  function  and  are  characterized  by  diminished  or  absent  feeling  that
often is experienced as numbness and by abnormal findings on sensory examination.
It is estimated that at least one-half of the afferent axons innervating a particular site are lost or
functionless before a sensory deficit can be demonstrated by clinical examinations.
Subclinical  degrees  of  sensory  dysfunction  may  be  revealed  by  sensory  nerve  conduction
studies.
Whereas  sensory  symptoms  may  be  either  positive  or  negative,  sensory  signs  on  examination
are always a measure of negative phenomena.

OTHERS

Dizziness, vertigo, blackouts, and fatigue

Dizziness:  It  covers  many  complaints,  from  a  vague  feeling  of  unsteadiness  to  severe,  acute
vertigo.  It  is  frequently  used  to  describe  lightheadedness  felt  in  panic  and  anxiety,  during
palpitations,  and  in  syncope  or  chronic  ill-health.  The  real  nature  of  this  symptom  must  be
determined.

Vertigo:  An  illusion  of  movement—is  more  definite.  It  is  a  sensation  of  rotation,  or  tipping.  The
patient  feels  that  the  surroundings  are  spinning  or  moving.  It  is  distinctly  unpleasant  and  often
accompanied by nausea or vomiting.

Blackout  like  dizziness,  is  a  descriptive  term  implying  either  altered  consciousness,  visual
disturbance  or  falling.  Epilepsy,  syncope,  hypoglycemia,  anemia  must  be  considered.  However,
commonly no sinister cause is found. A careful history from an eyewitness is essential.

Fatigue is another common symptom of neurological disorders.

Examination

Any of the following methods can be adopted:
•
•
•

Ask the patient to kick a football, normally the dominant side leg is used.
Ask the patient to peep through a keyhole, normally the dominant side eye is used.
Ask the patient to fold the arms in front one over the other, the dominant hand is the one which
lies anteriorly.
Ask the patient to “stand at ease” position, the dominant hand is the one which lies posteriorly.

•

Clinical Implications

3.

Handedness is important for rehabilitation of the patient (right-handed individuals—dominant left
hemisphere needs to be aggressively rehabilitated so as to have minimal residual deficit).
Degenerative diseases like Huntington’s disease have been postulated to be more common in
individuals with right dominant cortex.
Failure  to  develop  clear  hemispheric  dominance  has  been  implicated  in  dyslexia,  stuttering,
mirror writing, learning disability, and general clumsiness.

Education

•
•

Formal education up to standard ______.
It  is  important  for  testing  components  of  higher  mental  functions  like  calculation,  reading,  and
writing.

CONSCIOUSNESS

The  ascending  reticular  activating  system  (RAS)  arising  from  the  reticular  formation  of  the
brainstem, primarily the paramedian tegmentum of the upper pons and midbrain, and projects to the
paramedian,  parafascicular,  centromedian,  and  intralaminar  nuclei  of  the  thalamus.  This  is  the
primary control of consciousness.

The hypothalamus is also important for consciousness; arousal can be produced by stimulation

of the posterior hypothalamic region.

Coma

•

•
•

It is a state of complete loss of consciousness from which the patient cannot be aroused by
ordinary stimuli.
There is complete unresponsiveness to self and the environment.
The patient in coma has no awareness of themselves, makes no voluntary movements, and has
no sleep-wake cycles.

Stupor

•

•

It is a state of partial or relative loss of response to the environment in which the patient’s
consciousness may be impaired to varying degrees.
The patient can be aroused only with vigorous or unpleasant stimuli (e.g. sharp pressure or
pinch, or rolling a pencil across the nail bed).
No significant voluntary verbal or motor responses.
Mass movement responses may be observed in response to painful stimuli or loud noises.

•
•
For example:
•
•

Bilateral cerebral hemisphere disease
Upper brainstem diseases

Lethargy/drowsiness Patient can usually be aroused or awakened and may then appear to be in complete possession of

their senses, but promptly falls asleep when left alone. It resembles normal sleepiness.
For example: High brainstem disturbances

Obtundation

Refers to moderate reduction in the patient’s level of awareness such that stimuli of mild-to-
moderate intensity fail to arouse; when arousal does occur, the patient is slow to respond.

Minimally conscious
(vegetative) state

•

•
•

Return of irregular sleep-wake cycles and normalization of the so-called vegetative functions—
respiration, digestion, and blood pressure control.
The patient may be aroused, but remains unaware of his or her environment.
There is no purposeful attention or cognitive responsiveness.

Persistent vegetative
state

Individuals who remain in a vegetative state 1 year or longer after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 3
months or more after anoxic brain injury.

Confusional state

Patients may appear alert, but are confused and disoriented.
It is usually tested in three dimensions:
1.
2.
3.

Time
Place
Person.

Delirium

Catatonia

It is an acute organic mental disorder characterized by confusion, restlessness, incoherence,
inattention, anxiety, or hallucinations which may be reversible with treatment.
For example:
•
•

Toxicity (alcohol)
Infections

•
•

Symptom of psychotic state in which the patient is otherwise normal.
He does not follow movements, does not appear to pay attention to surroundings and will often
have aplastic rigidity of limbs which may remain in any position in which they are placed
(however bizarre the position may be).

It  is  preferable  to  describe  the  patient’s  state  of  responsiveness  or  use  an  objective  and  well-
defined scheme, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

Glasgow coma scale–pupils score

■

■

The Glasgow coma scale-pupils score (GCS-P) was described in 2018 as a strategy to
combine the two key indicators of the severity of traumatic brain injury into a single simple
index
Calculation of the GCS-P is by subtracting the pupil reactivity score (PRS) from the
Glasgow coma scale (GCS) total score:

■

The pupil reactivity score is calculated as follows:

GCS-P = GCS – PRS

Pupils unreactive to light

Pupil reactivity score

Both pupils

One pupil

Neither pupil

2

0

■

The GCS-P score can range from 1 and 15 and extends the range over which early
severity can be shown to relate to outcomes of either mortality or independent recovery.

ORIENTATION

Time

Person

Ask for year, season, month, date, and time

Ask for country, state, city, hospital name, and floor/ward

•
•

•

What is your name?
How old are you?
Where were you born?
What is the name of your wife/husband?

Findings are documented in the medical record as follows: Patient is alert and oriented × 3 (time,
person, and place) or × 2 (person, place) depending on the domains correctly identified.

An additional domain that can be examined is circumstance.
(What happened to you? What kind of a place is this? Why do people come here?)

which the material is not actually committed to memory
Ask patient to repeat series of random digits forward and backward
Normal digit span is 7 ± 2

Dorsolateral frontal lobe,
prefrontal cortex, and
perisylvian cortex

Recent, or short-term memory is tested by giving the patient items (pen,
phone, and bottle) to recall
After ensuring the patient has registered the items, proceed with other
testing. After approximately 5 minutes, ask the patient to recall the items

Remote
(long-term)

•

A patient’s fund of information reflects their remote memory. The fund of
information includes schooling details, famous personalities, major events
in history, etc.

Episodic memory refers to the system involved in remembering particular episodes or experiences, such as the movie you
saw last weekend or the meeting you attended yesterday.
Semantic memory refers to the type of long-term memory concerned with factual details outside of personal details

Budson and Price concept of memory systems: The frontal lobe can be considered as filing clerk, deciding which
information has to be filed or retrieved. The medial temporal lobes are the actual filing cabinets for recent memories and the
neocortical regions are filing cabinets for remote memories

Wernicke’s encephalopathy—g lobal confusion, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia (mneumonic—goa).
Korsakoff’s psychosis: Recent memory loss + confabulation (anteromedial thalamus)

Amnesia

Anterograde amnesia

Impaired registration and recall of new information

Retrograde amnesia

Impaired recall of information registered within a certain interval before the disease onset

ATTENTION

•
•

•

Attention is the directing of consciousness to a person, thing, perception, or thought.
It depends on the capacity of the brain to process information from the environment or from long-
term memory.
An  individual  with  intact  selective  attention  is  able  to  screen  and  process  relevant  sensory
information about both the task and the environment while screening out irrelevant information.

•
•

•
•

•

•
•

Selective attention can be examined by asking the patient to attend to a particular task.
For  example,  the  doctor  asks  the  patient  to  repeat  a  short  list  of  numbers  forward  or  backward
(digit span test).
Normally, individuals can recall seven forward and five backward numbers.
Sustained  attention  (or  vigilance)  is  examined  by  determining  how  long  the  patient  is  able  to
maintain attention on a particular task (time on task).
Alternating  attention  (attention  flexibility)  is  examined  by  requesting  the  patient  to  alternate
back and forth between two different tasks (e.g. add the first two pairs of numbers, then subtract
the next two pairs of numbers).
Requesting the patient to perform two tasks simultaneously determines divided attention.
For example, the patient talks while walking (Walkie–Talkie test).

SPEECH

Definitions

Phonation

It is defined as the production of vocal sounds without word formation; it is entirely a function of the larynx

Vocalization It is the sound made by the vibration of the vocal folds, modified by working of the vocal tract

Speech

It consists of words which are articulate vocal sounds that symbolize and communicate ideas

Articulation It is the enunciation of words and phrases; it is a function of organs and muscles innervated by the brainstem

Language
(Fig.
6D(ii).1)

•
•
•
•
•

•

It is a mechanism for expressing thoughts and ideas as follows:
By speech (auditory symbols)
By writing (graphic symbols), or
By gestures and pantomime (motor symbols)
Language may be regarded as any means of expressing or communicating feeling or thought using a
system of symbols.
It is a function of the cerebral cortex

Aphasia

Aphasia is an acquired disorder with loss or defective language content of speech resulting from damage to
the speech centers within the dominant (usually left in 97%) hemisphere

Paraphasia

Substitution in the components of speech, e.g. foon for spoon

Neologism Use of words which are nonexistent. Classically seen with Wernicke’s aphasia

Jargon

Completely meaningless speech containing neologisms and paraphasias. Described in Wernicke’s aphasia

Echolalia

Continuous repetition of heard words or sentences. Seen with transcortical sensory and transcortical mixed
aphasias.

Alexia

It is the impairment of visual word recognition, in the context of intact auditory word recognition and writing
ability

Agraphia

It is the inability to write, as a language disorder resulting from brain damage

Anomia

In this, word approximates the correct answer but it phonetically inaccurate (plentil for pencil)—phonemic
paraphasia. When the patient cannot say the appropriate name when an object is shown but can point the
object when the name is provided, it is known as one way or retrieval-based naming deficit

Mutism

Unable to speak or make sound

Aphonia

Unable to produce sound

Aphemia

Loss of speech

Slurred speech can be because of aphasia or dysarthria.

Aphasia

Dysarthria

Aphasia is a disorder of language

Dysarthria is a disorder of the motor production or articulation of
speech

Usually due to cerebral dysfunction/lesions

Dysarthria is defective articulation of sounds or words of
neurologic origin (usually brainstem)

Aphasia usually affects other language functions, such
as reading and writing

In dysarthria, there are often other accompanying bulbar
abnormalities, such as dysphagia

APHASIAS

•

•

•

•

•
•

Aphasia is an acquired disorder with loss or defective language content of speech resulting from
damage to the speech centers within the dominant (usually left in 97%) hemisphere.
A  language  disturbance  occurring  after  a  right  hemisphere  lesion  in  a  right  hander  is  known  as
crossed aphasia.
It includes defect in or loss of the power of expression by speech, writing, or gestures or a defect
in or loss of the ability to comprehend spoken or written language or to interpret gestures.
Aphasia may be categorized according to whether the speech output is fluent or nonfluent.

–

–

Fluent aphasias (receptive aphasias) are impairments mostly due to the input or reception
of  language  with  difficulties  either  in  auditory  verbal  comprehension  or  in  the  repetition  of
words, phrases, or sentences spoken by others. For example, Wernicke’s aphasia.
Nonfluent aphasias (expressive aphasias) are difficulties in articulating with relatively good
auditory, verbal comprehension. For example, Broca’s aphasia [Fig. 6D(ii).3].

Normal fluency 100–150 words/min, sentence length >7 words.
Reduced fluency in Broca’s aphasia, transcortical motor, global aphasia, and primary progressive
aphasia.

Lesions in the anterior limb of internal capsule/basal ganglia can produce Broca’s like aphasia.
Lesions in the thalamus can produce Wernicke’s like aphasia.
Most common type of aphasia seen in stroke: Broca’s aphasia.
Overall most common type of aphasia is anomic aphasia.

DYSARTHRIAS

Production of sounds requires:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Normal respiration
Muscles of articulation (labial, lingual, and palatal muscles)
Phonation (by larynx)
Resonance (by nasopharynx).

Articulated Sounds

Articulated labials (b, p, m, and w) are formed principally by the lips.
Modified labials (o and u, and to a lesser extent i, e, and a) are altered by lip contraction.
Labiodentals (f and v) are formed by placing the teeth against the lower lip.
Linguals are sounds formed with tongue action.
T, d, l, r, and n are tongue point, or alveolar sounds formed by touching the tip of the tongue to
the upper alveolar ridge.
S, z, sh, zh, ch, and j are dentals, or tongue blade sounds.
To hear distorted linguals, place the tip of your tongue against the back of your bottom teeth, hold
it there and say “top dog,” “go jump”, and “train”.
To hear distorted labials, hold your upper lip between the thumb and forefinger of one hand and
your bottom lip similarly with the other and say “my baby”.
Gutturals (velars, or tongue back sounds, such as k, g, and ng) are articulated between the back of
the tongue and the soft palate.
Palatals  (German  ch  and  g,  and  the  French  gn)  are  formed  when  the  dorsum  of  the  tongue
approximates the hard palate.

APRAXIA

Definition

Apraxia  is  impaired  ability  (inability)  to  carry  out  (perform)  skilled,  complex,  and  organized  motor
activities in the presence of normal basic motor, sensory, and cerebellar functions.

Examples of complex motor activities: Dressing, using cutlery, and geographical orientation.

Ideomotor
apraxia

Most common. It is the inability to perform a specific motor command/act (e.g. cough, lighting a cigarette
with a matchstick) in the absence of motor weakness, incoordination, and sensory loss or aphasia. Site of
lesion is bilateral parietal lobe. Buccofacial apraxia involves apraxic deficits in movements of the face and
mouth. Limb apraxia encompasses apraxic deficits in movements of the arms and legs

Types

Dressing
apraxia

Constructional
apraxia

Ideational
apraxia

Gait apraxia
(Bruns ataxia)

Site of lesion is nondominant parietal lobe. It is inability to wear his/her dress

It is inability to copy simple diagrams or build simple blocks. Site of lesion is nondominant parietal lobe

It is a deficit in the execution of a goal-directed sequence of movements even with real object (e.g. asked
to pick up a pen and write, the sequence of uncapping the pen, and placing the cap at the opposite end).
This is commonly associated with confusion and dementia rather than focal lesions associated with
aphasic conditions

Seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)

Gaze apraxia

Part of Balint syndrome

Other apraxias Speech apraxia, conceptual apraxia, and conduction apraxia

AGNOSIA

Definition

Agnosia is failure to recognize objects (e.g. places, clothing, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells),
despite the presence of intact sensory system.

Site of lesion: Contralateral parietal lobe.

Types of agnosias

Visual agnosia

Failure to recognize what is seen with eyes despite the presence of intact visual pathways. The
individual can describe the shape, color, and size without naming it. Site of lesion is in the posterior
occipital or temporal lobes

Prosopagnosia

A type of visual agnosia in which patient cannot identify familiar faces, sometimes the reflection of his
or her own face in the mirror even including their own. Site of lesion is parieto-occipital lobe

Simultanagnosia

It is inability to perceive more than one object at a time

Autotopagnosia

It is a form of agnosia, characterized by an inability to localize and orient different parts of the body

Pseudopolymelia The feeling of false—the feeling of false extremities. More frequent, the patients feel the extremities.

More frequent, the patients feel the third hand

Anosognosia

It is an inability or refusal to recognize a defect or disorder that is clinically evident

Auditory agnosia It consists of the loss of ability to know objects on sounds characteristic for them (clock—on ticking)

DELUSIONS

Definition

Delusion is a belief held with strong conviction despite superior evidence to the contrary (strongly
held false beliefs).

It is a disorder of content of thought.

Types of delusion (based on their content)

Persecutory
delusions

Conviction that others are out to get me

Grandiose delusions

Belief that one has special powers or status

Nihilistic delusions

Conviction that “my head is missing/rotting”, “i have no body”, and “I am dead”

Erotomanic delusions Believing a movie star loves them

Somatic delusions

Believing head is filled with air/worms

Delusions of
reference

Delusions of
control/passivity

Believing story in a book is referring to them

Believing one’s thoughts and movements are controlled by aliens

Other delusions are

Delusions of misinterpretation, hypochondrial delusions, fantastic/bizarre delusions, delusions of
passivity, delusions of jealousy

HALLUCINATIONS

Definition

Hallucinations are perceptions without external stimuli (wakeful sensory experiences of content
that is not actually present). They can occur in any sensory modality, most common being visual
or auditory.

For example, hearing voices when no one else is present, or seeing “visions”. Other types include
tactile  (cocaine  bug),  olfactory,  gustatory,  command  kinesthetic/psychomotor,  and  lilliputian  and
complex hallucinations.

Pseudohallucinations

These are hallucinations that are perceived as originating in the external world, not in the patient’s
own mind.

Hypnagogic and Hypnopompic Hallucinations

In  narcolepsy  2,  specific  hallucinations  are  seen.  Hypnagogic:  They  occur  when  falling  asleep.
Hypnopompic: They occur on waking up from sleep.

(mnemonic—hypnoGOgic hallucinations are perceived while GOing to sleep).

Hallucinations

Illusions

Perceptions without external stimuli

Misperceptions of real external
stimuli

For example, hallucinating that someone is talking to them when there is no actual
stimulus

For example, mistaking a rope for
snake

LESIONS OF NONDOMINANT (RIGHT) HEMISPHERE
Neglect
Definition → directed inattention, or a relative lack of attention, paid to one hemisphere; patients are less aware (or
completely unaware) of objections or actions in one side of the world (usually the left).
Diagnosis
•

Severe forms → patients completely ignore left side, denying that, such as side even exists; they may leave their left side
ungroomed, unshaven, and undressed; may leave food on left side of plate uneaten; may deny they have a left hand, and
when confronted with it, may claim that it is actually the examiner’s.
Milder forms → may perform actions with their left side only with encouragement or after repeated prodding.
Most sensitive sign → extinction to double simultaneous stimulation; sensory stimuli applied singly to either side are
properly felt, but when both sides are stimulated simultaneously, only the non-neglected side is felt; extinction may exist
with tactile, visual, or auditory stimulation.
Etiology → lesions in right hemisphere (frontal or parietal lobe), most commonly an acute finding after stroke.
–
–
Others
•

Frontal lobe lesion → more of a motor neglect in which patient has tendency to not use left side for motor actions
Parietal lobe lesion → more of a sensory neglect in which stimuli from the left side tend to be ignored.

Prosody → while semantic elements of language (pure meaning) reside in dominant hemisphere, some other elements
of successful oral communication (e.g. proper voice inflection) reside in nondominant hemisphere
Anosognosia → tendency to be unaware of one’s deficits in some patient’s w/right hemispheric lesions
–

For example, patient with complete left hemiplegia may insist on immediate discharge from hospital because he feels
nothing is wrong
For example, patient with dense left hemianopia may wonder why she keeps bumping into others since she notices
nothing wrong with her vision.

Other miscellaneous points

•
•

•
•

Anosmia is commonly associated with hypogeusia/ageusia
Olfactory hallucinations: Usually of unpleasant odors like burned rubber, can occur in temporal lobe epilepsy, migraine
and schizophrenia
Hyperosmia: May be seen with Addison’s disease, cystic fibrosis or pituitary tumors
Merciful anosmia—atrophic rhinitis.

Note:
•
•
•

Olfactory is the only nerve which does not process through thalamus.
Olfactory and optic are the two nerves which do not pass through brainstem.
Loss of smell is usually associated with loss of taste sensation (Aguesia/hypogeusia).

Visual Acuity

Assessment  of  visual  acuity  is  usually  done  by  asking  the  patient  to  read  the  specific  charts  as
described below. The least possible distance with best vision is considered as the viewing distance.

Visual acuity

For far vision

Snellen chart [Fig. 6D(iii).2]

Examined at 6 m

Described as x/y → × (numerator—suggests the viewing distance of patient) and y
(denominator—viewing distance of normal person)

Note: In absence of Snellen’s chart finger counting can be done.

For near vision

Describes as J1, J2, etc.
Normal range of near
vision is J1 to J4

Defects in visual acuity may be due to:
•
•
•

Refractive errors

Visual Field Testing

Confrontation Method

Testing distance: 1 m or one full hands distance [Figs. 6D(iii).4A to C]

Instructions:
•

Subject  and  examiner  should  be  sitting  at  the  same  height  with  each  one  looking  into  each
other’s eye separated by distance of 1 m.
For checking the visual field of right eye of the subject, he is instructed to close his left eye with
his left hand while the examiner closes his right eye with right hand. Now, the examiner brings in
the  flickering  index  finger  of  left  hand  from  extremes  of  all  four  directions/quadrants  diagonally
toward the center of the visual field.
The subject is instructed to give the signal at the first instance of perceiving the flickering finger
movement.
Normal extent of visual field of individual eye:

•

•

•

–

–

Vertically up 60°
Vertically down 75°
Medially 60°
Laterally 100°

•

Normal extent of visual field in binocular vision:

–
–

Horizontally = 200°
Vertically = 140°

Congenital anomalies:
•

Red and green = chromosome X (mnemonic: remember Red, Green and Symbol X all are traffic
symbols)
Blue = chromosome 7 (mnemonic: remember sky is blue which has rainbow containing 7 colors).

•

Acquired  defects:  Color  vision  occur  in  macular  and  optic  nerve  diseases,  and  due  to  certain
drugs (e.g. ethambutol, chloroquine, digitalis, and sildenafil).

Fundus Examination

Instrument used: Direct ophthalmoscope.

How to use:
•
•
•
•

The subject should be examined in sitting or lying down position.
Examination room should be semidark.
Keep the eye as still as possible.
Hold  ophthalmoscope  in  same  hand  as  eye  you  are  looking  at,  and  looking  through  (e.g.  hold
ophthalmoscope  in  the  left  hand  for  examining  patients  left  eye,  through  your  left  eye)  [Figs.
6D(iii).9 and 6D(iii).10].
Hold head steady with thumb above eyebrow, or hold shoulder.
At about 30 cm distance with light on eye, locate red reflex (seen as an orange glow in the pupil).
Follow red reflex into the eye as this will get you directly into the optic disc.
If you cannot find the disc, trace any blood vessels back to it.
Examine vessels in all four quadrants of eye (upper and lower, nasal and temporal quadrants).
Identify macula—slightly darker pigmented area, two optic disc widths lateral away from the optic
disc.

Paralysis of levator palpebrae superioris (LPS)

Paralysis of tarsal muscle

LPS supplied by III cranial nerve

Tarsal muscle supplied by sympathetic
system

LPS is paralyzed and the patient cannot voluntarily rise the eyelid, he
compensates by contracting frontalis muscle and thus there is wrinkling of
forehead seen in long-standing cases

Here since the III nerve is intact and LPS is
not paralyzed, ptosis disappears on
voluntary contraction of LPS

•

The ice pack test is cheap, safe, and very quick to perform as it can be carried out at the bedside
in approximately 3–5 minutes
Positive test is the improvement of ptosis by >2 mm or more. This transient improvement in ptosis
is  due  to  thecold  decreasing  the  acetylcholinesterase  breakdown  of  acetylcholine  at  the
neuromuscular junction.

In  the  oculomotor  nerve  [Fig.  6D(iii).22],  the  parasympathetic  fibers  lying  on  the  peripheral  part
have dual blood supply via vasa nervosum and vessels on the sheet. In compressive lesions from
outside (tumor and hematoma), pupils are involved early.

In ischemic lesions, pupils are spared since the center of the nerve is affected early.

DIPLOPIA

Diplopia  means  double  vision.  Most  common  subjective  complaint  elicited  by  lesions  in  the
oculomotor system. Occurs more frequently with lesions of the extraocular muscles or oculomotor
nerves than with supranuclear lesions which result in gaze palsies.

Monocular Diplopia

•

The first point to clarify is whether diplopia persists in either eye after covering the fellow eye. If it
does, the diagnosis is monocular diplopia.

Figs. 6D(iii).24A to L: Ocular movements testing in a patient with right complete ophthalmoplegia.

•

The cause is usually intrinsic to the eye. For example, corneal aberrations, uncorrected refractive
error,  cataract,  foveal  traction  or  foreign  body  in  the  aqueous  or  vitreous  may  give  rise  to
monocular diplopia.

Binocular Diplopia

Diplopia improved by covering one eye is binocular diplopia and is caused by disruption of ocular
alignment. Occurs only if both eyes are open.

Binocular diplopia occurs from a wide range or processes: For example, infectious, neoplastic,

metabolic, degenerative, inflammatory, and vascular.

Assessment of Diplopia

•

•
•

•
•

Cover one of the patient’s eye with a transparent red shield. Move a point of light in the direction
of action of each muscle.
Ask the patient if he sees one object or two.
If double, do the images lie side by side or one above the other?

–
–

Side by side—medial rectus (MR)/lateral rectus (LR)
One  above  the  other—superior  rectus  (SR)/inferior  rectus  (IR)  and  superior  oblique
(SO)/inferior oblique (IO)

Which is the red image?
In which position the images are the farthest.

Points to note:

•

•

In  diplopia  two  images,  one  real  and  one  false  are  formed.  The  real  image  is  closer  to  the  eye
and distinct; the false image is farther away from eye and indistinct.
Separation of images is maximum in the direction of action of weak muscle.

Light reflex

•

Mediated by retinal photoreceptors.

–

Subserved by four neurons [Fig. 6D(iii).26]
1.

First (sensory)—connects each retina with both pretectal nuclei, nasal fibers decussate,
and temporal fibers uncrossed
Second (internuncial)—connects each pretectal nucleus to both Edinger–Westphal nuclei
—indirect reflex
Third (preganglionic motor)—connects Edinger–Westphal nucleus to ciliary ganglion.
–

Parasympathetic  fibers  pass  through  III  nerve  inferior  division  and  reach  the  ciliary
ganglion via the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle.

Fourth (postganglionic motor) leaves the ciliary ganglion and passes in the short ciliary
nerves to innervate the sphincter pupillae.

•

Fibers of Edinger–Westphal nucleus when entering the eye will cause constriction of the
pupil  and  stimulation  of  ciliary  muscle,  so  the  parasympathetic  causes  the  two  changes
(constriction of the pupil and contraction of ciliary muscle that increases the thickness of
the lens thus increasing its power).
The third change is convergence (adduction of both eyes by stimulating medial rectus on
both sides); this is achieved by the Vergence center that affects the oculomotor nucleus in

•

the midbrain on this side and the other. Fibers coming from the oculomotor nucleus will
enter  and  stimulate  the  medial  rectus  on  both  sides,  when  both  eyes  are  adducted,  the
image will be on the same area (focus) of the retina.

PUPILLARY ABNORMALITIES

Argyll Robertson Pupil

•

Small irregular pupil having light near dissociation [Fig. 6D(iii).28]
Characteristic feature:

–
–
–
–

In dim light, both pupils are small and may be irregular.
In bright light, neither pupil constricts.
On accommodation both pupils constrict (light near dissociation).
After instillation of pilocarpine 0.1% into both eyes, neither pupil constricts.

•
•

Described for neurosyphilis.
Lesion in periaqueductal region, pretectal, and rostral midbrain.

Other causes: Diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, and sarcoidosis.

Reverse Argyll Robertson Pupil

In this accommodation, reflex on the pupil is absent.
Cause: Diphtheria and tumors at corpora quadrigemina.

Fig. 6D(iii).27: Accommodation of reflex pathway.

Fig. 6D(iii).28: Argyll Robertson pupil.

Wernicke’s Hemianopic Pupil

•
•

It indicates lesion of the optic tract.
In  this  condition,  light  reflex  (ipsilateral  direct  and  contralateral  consensual)  is  absent
when light is thrown on the temporal half of the retina of the affected side and nasal half
of the opposite side; while it is present when the light is thrown on the nasal half of the
affected side and temporal half of the opposite side.

The Adie’s Tonic Pupil

In this condition, reaction to light is absent and to near reflex is very slow and tonic.
•
•
•

The affected pupil is larger (anisocoria).
Its exact cause is not known.
It is usually unilateral, associated with absent knee jerk and occurs more often in young
women.
Adie’s pupil constricts with weak pilocarpine (0.125%) drops, while normal pupil does not.
In long-standing cases, the pupil may become small (“little old Adie”).
In some cases, are diminished deep tendon reflexes (Holmes-Adie syndrome).

•
•
•

Afferent Pupillary Defect or Marcus Gunn Pupil

•
•
•

The status of the light reflex must be judged by comparing the two eyes [Fig. 6D(iii).29]
Indicator of optic nerve function
Swinging flashlight test: Light is held about 1 inch from the eye and just below the visual
axis; the light is rapidly alternated.

–
–

The examiner attends only to the stimulated eye.
Comparing the amplitude and velocity of the initial constriction in the two eyes.

•

The reaction is relatively weaker when the bad eye is illuminated.

Fig. 6D(iii).29: Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)/Marcus Gunn pupil.

•

•
•

The  brain  detects  a  relative  diminution  in  light  intensity  and  the  pupil  may  dilate  a  bit  in
response.
Bring out the dynamic anisocoria.
The  weaker  direct  response  or  the  paradoxical  dilation  of  the  light-stimulated  pupil  is
termed as an afferent pupillary defect (APD).

•
•

Trace  APD:  Pupil  that  has  an  initial  constriction,  but  then  it  escapes  to  a  larger
intermediate position than in the other eye.
1 to 2+ APD: No change in pupil size initially, then dilation.
3 to 4+ APD: Immediate dilation of the affected pupil.

Mnemonic—Protein MEAL [Fig. 6D(iii).33].
Usually unilateral: The smooth muscle fibers of the lower eyelid retractors also lose their
sympathetic supply in patients with Horner’s syndrome and, thus, the lower eyelid appears
slightly  elevated.  This  appearance  has  been  termed  “upside-down  ptosis”  or  “reverse
ptosis”.
•

Hypochromic  heterochromia  (iris  of  different  color—Horner  is  lighter)  may  be  seen  if
congenital  or  long-standing.  Sympathetic  innervation  is  thought  to  be  required  for  the
formation of melanin by stromal melanocytes.
Reduced ipsilateral sweating if the lesion is below the superior cervical ganglion, because
the sudomotor fibers supplying the skin of the face run along the external carotid artery.

OPHTHALMOPLEGIA

Definitions:

•

•

•

Supranuclear ophthalmoplegia: Also called as gaze palsies. It is due to involvement of
corticonuclear fibers of the III, IV, and VI cranial nerves.
Internuclear  ophthalmoplegia:  It  is  due  to  involvement  of  MLF  and  PPRF  which
connect the III nerve to the contralateral VI nerve.
Nuclear/infranuclear ophthalmoplegia: Involvement of individual cranial nerves (CN III,
IV, and VI).

•

Pontine lateral gaze center
Destructive lesion—loss of lateral gaze to
the same side
Irritative lesion—eyes deviate to the same
side as lesion

Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia

•

Caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF), which carries signals from
the  abducens  nucleus  to  the  contralateral  medial  rectus  oculomotor  subnucleus  [Fig.
6D(iii).38].

•

•

•

•

The  abducens  nerve  and  MLF  coordinate  conjugate  horizontal  eye  movements  with  co-
contraction of ipsilateral lateral rectus and contralateral medial rectus muscles.
Classic signs of unilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia include impaired adduction of the
ipsilesional eye and abducting nystagmus of the contralateral eye.
Despite ipsilateral adduction weakness with direct motility testing, adduction is often intact
with convergence because convergence signals to the medial rectus nucleus are distinct
from the MLF.
Multiple sclerosis and microvascular brainstem ischemia are the most common causes.

Pain

Note:
•

•

•

•

All the sensory supply relay via trigeminal ganglion which is also called as Gasserian
ganglion or semilunar ganglion.
It is largest ganglion located at Meckel’s cave, lateral to ICA and posterior to cavernous
sinus.
It is analogous to dorsal root ganglion.

Testing of sensory component:
•
•

Test the sensation of the face for touch, pain, and temperature in each of the divisions.
Sensation  should  be  compared  in  each  trigeminal  division,  and  the  perioral  region
compared  to  the  posterior  face  to  exclude  an  onion  skin  pattern  (Figs.  6D(iii).40  to
6D(iii).43)
Pain or temperature should be compared with touch to exclude dissociated sensory loss
(a common finding in lateral medullary syndrome).

Fig. 6D(iii).39: Image showing sensory distribution of three divisions of trigeminal nerve.

•

On the trunk, organic sensory loss typically stops short of midline because of the overlap
from  the  opposite  side,  and  crossing  of  the  midline  suggests  nonorganic  nature  of  the
symptoms. However, this finding is not reliable on the face because there is less midline
overlap, so organic facial sensory loss may extend to the midline.

Fig. 6D(iii).43: Examination of mandibular division of trigeminal nerve.

Testing of motor component [Figs. 6D(iii).44 and 6D(iii).45]:
•

Motor component can be gauged by palpating these muscles as the patient clinches the
jaw. An effective technique is to place the examining fingers along the anterior or lateral
border of the masseters bilaterally.
When the jaw is clenched, the fingers will move forward (when fingers placed anteriorly)
or  sideward  (when  fingers  placed  laterally);  this  movement  should  be  symmetric  on  the
two sides.
Unilateral  trigeminal  motor  weakness  causes  deviation  of  the  jaw  toward  the  weak  side
on  opening,  due  to  the  unopposed  action  of  the  contralateral  lateral  pterygoid.  Careful
observation of jaw opening is often the earliest clue to the presence of an abnormality.
It  is  occasionally  difficult  to  be  certain  whether  the  jaw  is  deviating  or  not.  Note  the
relationship of the midline notch between the upper and lower incisor teeth; it is a reliable
indicator.

Rule of 17 (10 + 7 and 12 + 5)

•
•

•
•

10 + 7 → In facial nerve weakness and vagus nerve involvement, the deviation will be toward the normal side
The levator anguli oris (in CN 7) and palatopharyngeus (in CN 10) are ‘pulling’ muscles. Hence, the normal side
‘pulls’ the angle of mouth/uvula toward the normal side

12 + 5 → In trigeminal nerve and hypoglossal nerve weakness, the deviation will be toward the affected side
The lateral pterygoid (CN 5) and the genioglossus (CN 12) are ‘pushing’ muscles. Hence, the normal side
‘pushes’ the angle of jaw/tongue toward the affected side

Note:  Exaggerated  reflex  is  due  to  lesion  in  the  bilateral  corticobulbar  tracts  above  motor
nucleus, e.g. pseudobulbar palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Fig. 6D(iii).46: Illustration showing examination of jaw jerk.

Testing [Fig. 6D(iii).47]:
•

Examiner places the index finger or thumb over the middle of patient’s chin, holding the
mouth open about midway with jaw relaxed and then taps the finger with reflex hammer.
The response is upward jerk of mandible.

•

Other methods:
•

For bilateral response:

–
–

Tapping chin directly
Placing the tongue blade over the tongue or lower incisor and tapping the protruding
end.

•

For unilateral response:

–
–

Tapping the angle of the jaw
Placing  the  tongue  blade  over  the  lower  molar  teeth  of  one  side  and  tapping  the
protruding end.

Sternutatory/Nasal/Sneeze Reflex
Primary clinical use is to cross check the corneal reflex.

Method:  Stimulation  of  nasal  mucous  membrane  with  cotton,  a  spear  of  tissue  or  similar
object → wrinkling of nose, eye closure, and often a forceful exhalation resembling a feeble
sneeze.

Theory:  The  ophthalmic  division  of  trigeminal  innervates  the  nasal  septum  and  anterior
nasal passages.

Trigeminal Neuralgia (Also known as Fothergill’s disease Tic douloureux)
•

Most common disorder to involve trigeminal sensory function.

Paroxysms  of  fleeting  but  excruciation  unilateral  facial  pain—usually  involves  II  and  III
division and rarely I division.
Pain lasts for few seconds but may occur many times per day.
Trigger for pain may be talking, chewing, brushing, exposure to cold or by wind on face.
Most  common  cause  for  compression  of  sensory  root  by  ecstatic  arterial  loop  of  the
basilar artery (AICA or superior cerebellar artery)
Other causes include MS, tumors of CP angle—bilateral is suggestive of MS.

division also.
Persistent  neuralgic  pain  syndrome  after  1  month  of  acute  eruption  is  appropriately
labeled  as  postherpetic  neuralgia.  It  is  a  dysesthetic  with  burning  component,  constant
but  with  superimposed  paroxysm  of  lancinating  pain  that  may  be  provoked  by  touching
certain spots with affected area.
There may be hypo- or hyperesthesia.

Reflexes

Orbicularis oculi reflex

Percussion causes reflex contraction of the eye muscle. The reflex is known as the supraorbital, glabellar, or
nasopalpebral reflex, depending upon the site of the stimulus. Both eyes usually close, with the contralateral
response being weaker. The trigeminal nerve is the afferent side and the facial nerve the efferent side of the
reflex. Light and sound can also produce the reflex, with the optic and acoustic nerves providing the afferent side

The response is weak or abolished in nuclear and peripheral lesions, and present or exaggerated in supranuclear
lesions. It is exaggerated in Parkinsonism and cannot be voluntarily inhibited

Palpebral oculogyric reflex

The eyeballs deviate upward when the eyes are closed, both when awake and asleep. The afferent arc is
proprioceptive impulses carried through the facial nerve to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The oculomotor
nerve to the superior rectus muscles forms the efferent side

In peripheral and nuclear lesions, an exaggeration of this reflex is known as Bell’s phenomenon

Orbicularis oris reflex

Percussion on the side of the nose or the upper lip causes ipsilateral elevation of the angle of the mouth and
upper lip. The reflex arc is composed of the fifth and seventh nerves. Synonyms: nasomental, buccal, oral, or
perioral reflex

This reflex disappears after about the first year of life, recurring with supranuclear facial nerve lesions and with
extrapyramidal diseases, such as Parkinsonism

Snout reflex

Tapping the upper lip lightly with a reflex hammer, tongue blade, or finger causes bilateral contraction of the
muscles around the mouth and base of the nose. The mouth resembles a snout

This is an exaggeration of the orbicularis oris reflex. It is present with bilateral supranuclear lesions and in diffuse
cerebral diseases, such as various causes of dementia

Sucking reflex

Sucking movements of lips, tongue, and mouth are brought about by lightly touching or tapping on the lips. At
times, merely bringing an object near the lips produces the reflex

Occurs in patients with diffuse cerebral lesions. The snout reflex occurs in similar circumstances

A stimulus of the thenar area of the hand causes a reflex contraction ipsilaterally of the orbicularis oris and
mentalis muscles

Palmomental reflex

A number of normal individuals have this reflex, and also patients with diffuse cerebral disease. It is significant
when other similar reflexes are also present

Stimulation of the cornea with a wisp of cotton produces reflex closure of both ipsilateral (strongest) and
contralateral eyelids. The fifth nerve carries the afferent impulses, and the facial nerve the efferent impulses

The  cause  of  the  unconsciousness  in  a  patient  with  a  negative  oculocephalic  reflex  is
some  sort  of  destructive  brainstem  pathology  or  brain  death.  Conversely,  an  intact
oculocephalic reflex suggests that the coma is of a nonstructural cause, because much of
the brainstem must be intact.

CRANIAL NERVE IX AND X—GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL AND VAGUS

The two nerves:
•
•

Have motor and autonomic branches with nuclei of origin in the medulla.
Both  conduct  general  somatic  afferent  (GSA)  as  well  as  general  visceral  afferent  (GVA)
fibers to related or identical fiber tracts and nuclei in the brainstem.
Both  have  a  parasympathetic,  or  general  visceral  efferent,  and  a  branchiomotor,  or
special visceral efferent (SVE), component
Both leave the skull together
Remain close in their course through the neck
Both supply some of the same structures.
They are often involved in the same disease processes

and pharyngeal mucosa.

Testing of IX Nerve

Cranial  nerve  IX  is  difficult  to  examine  because  most  or  all  of  its  functions  are  shared  by
other nerves and because many of the structures it supplies are inaccessible.

Gag reflex [Fig. 6D(iii).67]

•

•

•

•

•

The  gag  reflex  is  protective;  it  is  designed  to  prevent  noxious  substances  or  foreign
objects from going beyond the oral cavity.
Components  of  gag  reflex:  There  are  three  motor  components:  elevation  of  the  soft
palate  to  seal  off  the  nasopharynx,  closure  of  the  glottis  to  protect  the  airway,  and
constriction of the pharynx to prevent entry of the substance.
Pathway:  The  afferent  limb  of  the  reflex  is  mediated  by  CN  IX  and  the  efferent  limb
through CNs IX and X. The reflex center is in the medulla.
Testing  of  gag  reflex:  The  reflex  is  elicited  by  touching  the  lateral  oropharynx  in  the
region of the anterior faucial pillar with a tongue blade, applicator stick, or similar object
(pharyngeal reflex), or by touching one side of the soft palate or uvula (palatal reflex). The
reflex also occurs with touching the base of the tongue or posterior pharyngeal wall.
Clinical implication: May be bilaterally absent in some normal individuals.
Unilateral absence signifies a lower motor neuron lesion. Like most bulbar muscles, the
pharynx receives bilateral supranuclear innervation, and a unilateral cerebral lesion does
not  cause  detectable  weakness.  A  hyperactive  gag  reflex  may  occur  with  bilateral
cerebral lesions, as in pseudobulbar palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

•

Unilateral  supranuclear  lesions  cause  no  deficit  because  of  the  bilateral  corticobulbar
innervation.
Bilateral supranuclear lesions may cause pseudobulbar palsy.
Nuclear and infranuclear processes that may affect CN IX include intramedullary and
extramedullary  neoplasms  and  other  mass  lesions  (e.g.  glomus  jugulare  tumor),  trauma
(e.g.  basilar  skull  fracture  or  surgical  dissection),  motor  neuron  disease,  syringobulbia,

(or

patient experiences attacks of severe lancinating pain originating in one side of the throat or
tonsillar  region  and  radiating  along  the  course  of  the  eustachian  tube  to  the  tympanic
membrane, external auditory canal, behind the angle of the jaw, and adjacent portion of the
ear. The pain may be brought on by talking, eating, swallowing, or coughing. It can lead to
syncope,  convulsions,  and  rarely  to  cardiac  arrest  because  of  stimulation  of  the  carotid
sinus reflex.

lesion  of 

important 

CRANIAL NERVE X—VAGUS

The vagus (in Latin means “wandering,” because of its wide distribution) is the longest and
most widely distributed.

The  vagus  emerges  from  the  medulla  as  a  series  of  rootlets  just  below  those  of  the

glossopharyngeal.

CN  X  leaves  the  skull  through  the  jugular  foramen  in  the  same  neural  sheath  as  the
cranial root of CN XI and behind CN IX. In the jugular foramen, the nerve lies close to the
jugular  bulb,  a  dilatation  of  the  internal  jugular  vein  that  houses  the  glomus  jugulare
(tympanic body). The glomus jugulare has functions similar to the carotid body.

Branches of cranial nerves: There are 10 major terminal branches that arise at different
levels:  (a)  meningeal,  (b)  auricular,  (c)  pharyngeal,  (d)  carotid,  (e)  superior  laryngeal,  (f)
recurrent laryngeal, (g) cardiac, (h) esophageal, (i) pulmonary, and (j) gastrointestinal.

Motor:  The  vagus,  with  a  contribution  from  the  bulbar  portion  of  CN  XI,  supplies  all  the
striated muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx except for the stylopharyngeus (CN
IX) and tensor veli palatini (CN V).

Parasympathetic: The vagus is the longest parasympathetic nerve in the body and a vagal
discharge  causes  bradycardia,  hypotension,  bronchoconstriction,  bronchorrhea,  increased
peristalsis, increased gastric secretion, and inhibition of adrenal function. The vagal centers
in  the  medulla  that  control  these  functions  are  themselves  under  the  control  of  higher
centers in the cortex and hypothalamus. Inhibition of vagal function produces the opposite
effects.

Sensory: Both vagal ganglia are sensory. The superior ganglion primarily conveys somatic
sensation, and most of its communication is with the auricular nerve. The inferior ganglion
relays general visceral sensation and taste.

Normal functions mediated by CNs IX and X include swallowing, phonation, and airway

protection and modulation.

Examination

Motor  function:  The  character  of  the  voice  and  the  ability  to  swallow  provide  information
about the branchiomotor functions of the vagus.

Clinical implications:
A unilateral vagal lesion causes weakness of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx. Acute
lesions may produce difficulty swallowing both liquids and solids and hoarseness or a nasal
quality to the voice. Sensory change is anesthesia of the larynx due to involvement of the
superior laryngeal nerve. The gag reflex is absent on the involved side. Autonomic reflexes
(vomiting, coughing, and sneezing) are not usually affected.

Bilateral complete vagal paralysis is incompatible with life. It causes complete paralysis
of the palate, pharynx, and larynx, with marked dysphagia and dysarthria; tachycardia; slow,
irregular, and respiration; vomiting; and gastrointestinal atonia.

Disorders of Cranial Nerve X

Unilateral  supranuclear  lesions  generally  cause  no  dysfunction  because  of  bilateral
innervation.

Bilateral  supranuclear  lesions,  as  from  pseudobulbar  palsy,  cause  dysphagia  and
dysarthria.

Extrapyramidal disorders may produce difficulty with swallowing and talking. Patients with
Parkinson’s  disease  typically  have  a  hypokinetic  dysarthria.  Laryngeal  spasm  with  stridor
may occur in Parkinson’s disease.

CRANIAL NERVE XI—SPINAL ACCESSORY

The spinal accessory (SA) nerve, cranial nerve XI (CN XI), is actually two nerves that run
together in a common bundle for a short distance [Fig. 6D(iii).68].

Cranial  part  (ramus  internus):  The  smaller  cranial  portion  is  a  special  visceral  efferent
(SVE) accessory to the vagus. It emerges from the medulla laterally as four or five rootlets
caudal to the vagal filaments. The cranial root runs to the jugular foramen and unites with
the spinal portion, traveling with it for only a few millimeters to form the main trunk of CN XI.
The  cranial  root  communicates  with  the  jugular  ganglion  of  the  vagus,  and  then  exits
through  the  jugular  foramen  separately  from  the  spinal  portion.  It  is  distributed  principally
with the recurrent laryngeal nerve to sixth branchial arch muscles in the larynx.

Fig. 6D(iii).68: Anatomy of spinal accessory nerve.

Spinal part (ramus externus): The major part of CN XI is the spinal portion. Its function is
to innervate the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and trapezius muscles. The fibers of the spinal
root arise from SVE motor cells in the SA nuclei in the ventral horn from C2 to C5, or even
C6. These unite into a single trunk, which ascends between the denticulate ligaments and
the posterior roots. The nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, ascends the
clivus for a short distance, and then curves laterally. The spinal root joins the cranial root for
a short distance, probably receiving one or two filaments from it. It exits through the jugular
foramen in company with CNs IX and X.
C1-2 supplies sternocleidomastoid.
C3-4 supplies trapezius.

Testing the Spinal Accessory Nerve

Cranial Part

The functions of the cranial portion of CN XI cannot be distinguished from those of CN X,
and examination is limited to evaluation of the functions of the spinal portion.

Spinal Part

Testing SCM [Figs. 6D(iii).69 and 6D(iii).70]:

Testing one muscle at a time: To assess SCM power, have the patient turn the head fully
to one side and hold it there, then try to turn the head back to midline, avoiding any tilting or
leaning  motion.  The  muscle  usually  stands  out  well,  and  its  contraction  can  be  seen  and
felt.  Significant  weakness  of  rotation  can  be  detected  if  the  patient  tries  to  counteract  firm
resistance.

Testing two muscle at a time: The two SCM muscles can be examined simultaneously by
having the patient flex his neck while the examiner exerts pressure on the forehead or by
having  the  patient  turn  the  head  from  side  to  side.  Flexion  of  the  head  against  resistance
may cause deviation of the head toward the paralyzed side.

Fig. 6D(iii).69: Examination of sternocleidomastoid muscle (testing one muscle at a time).

Fig. 6D(iii).70: Examination of sternocleidomastoid (testing both muscles at a time).

Interpretation: With unilateral paralysis, the involved muscle is flat and does not contract or
become tense when attempting to turn the head contralaterally or to flex the neck against
resistance. Weakness of both SCMs causes difficulty in anteroflexion of the neck, and the
head may assume an extended position.

Testing trapezius muscle (Fig. 6D(iii).71):

Inspection: With trapezius atrophy, inspection findings include:
•
•
•

Depression or drooping of the shoulder contour
Flattening of the trapezius ridge
Sagging of the shoulder

Fig. 6D(iii).71: Traditional method of assessing trapezius muscle (shrugging shoulders
against resistance).

•
•

The resting position of the scapula shifts downward
The upper portion of the scapula tends to fall laterally while inferior angle moves inward
(this scapular rotation and displacement are more obvious with arm abduction).

Palpation:

Traditional  method:  The  strength  of  the  trapezius  is  traditionally  tested  by  having  the
patient shrug the shoulders against resistance. However, much of shoulder shrugging is due
to the action of the levator scapulae.

Newer methods:

For  upper  trapezius:  Resisting  the  patient’s  attempt  to  approximate  the  occiput  to  the
acromion. Impairment of upper trapezius function causes weakness of abduction beyond
90°.
For middle and lower trapezius: Place the patient’s abducted arm horizontally, palm up,
and  attempt  to  push  the  elbow  forward.  Muscle  power  should  be  compared  on  the  two
sides. Weakness of the middle trapezius muscle causes winging of the scapula.

•

Clinical  implication:  Weakness  of  the  muscles  supplied  by  CN  XI  may  be  caused  by
supranuclear, nuclear, or infranuclear lesions.
•

Supranuclear involvement: Irritative supranuclear lesions may cause head turning away
from the discharging hemisphere. This turning of the head (or head and eyes) may occur
as  part  of  a  controversive,  ipsiversive,  or  Jacksonian  seizure  and  is  often  the  first
manifestation  of  the  seizure.  Extrapyramidal  lesions  may  also  involve  the  SCM  and
trapezius muscles, causing rigidity, akinesia, or hyperkinesis.
Nuclear involvement of the SA nerve may occur in motor neuron disease, syringobulbia,
and  syringomyelia.  In  nuclear  lesions,  the  weakness  is  frequently  accompanied  by
atrophy and fasciculations.
Infranuclear  or  peripheral  lesions—either  extramedullary  but  within  the  skull,  in  the
jugular foramen, or in the neck—are the most common causes of impairment of function
of the SA nerve. Tumors in the foramen magnum, lesions of the cerebellopontine angle,
basal skull fractures, and meningitis.

CRANIAL NERVE XII—HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE

Function:  CN  XII  supplies  the  intrinsic  muscles,  and  all  of  the  extrinsic  muscles  of  the
tongue except the palatoglossus.

Anatomy  [Fig.  6D(iii).72]:  Nucleus  located  in  medial  medulla.  Distribution  of  fibers  from
rostral to caudal, the innervation is intrinsic tongue muscles, then genioglossus, hyoglossus,
and styloglossus.

Fig. 6D(iii).72: Location of hypoglossal nerve.

Examination
The  clinical  examination  of  hypoglossal  nerve  function  consists  of  evaluating  the  strength,
bulk,  and  dexterity  of  the  tongue—looking  especially  for  weakness,  atrophy,  abnormal
movements (particularly fasciculations), and impairment of rapid movements.

Inspection:
•

•

•

Palpation:
•

Tongue  deviation:  To  look  for  tongue  deviation  by  asking  the  patient  to  protrude  the
tongue and also to move the tongue to either sides.
Fasciculations: Ask the patient to open the mouth and with the tongue inside the mouth
look for the fasciculations.

Hold  the  tongue  with  gauze  and  palpate  the  tongue  with  gloved  finger  to  examine  the
consistency of the tongue [Fig. 6D(iii).73].
To examine the power of the tongue patient is instructed to push the tongue against the
cheek while giving the counter resistance from outside [Fig. 6D(iii).74].

Fig. 6D(iii).73: Palpation of tongue.

Fig. 6D(iii).74: Examining the motor power of tongue.

Interpretation

On inspection:
•

Tongue deviation [Fig. 6D(iii).75]: When unilateral weakness is present, the tongue deviates toward
the  weak  side  on  protrusion  because  of  the  action  of  the  normal  genioglossus.  And  also  there  is
impairment of the ability to deviate the protruded tongue toward the opposite side.
Fasciculations: Presence of fasciculations suggests LMN paralysis of the 12th cranial nerve.

•

On palpation:
•
•

Small and stiff tongue: Suggestive of UMN type of 12th nerve palsy.
Flabby tongue with fasciculations: Suggestive of LMN type of 12th nerve palsy.

Other  clinical  aspects:  The  neck-tongue  syndrome,  consisting  of  pain  in  the  neck  and  numbness  or
tingling in the ipsilateral half of the tongue on sharp rotation of the head, has been attributed to damage
to lingual afferent fibers traveling in the hypoglossal nerve to the C2 spinal roots through the atlantoaxial
space.

MUSCLE BULK/NUTRITION

•

•
•

•

Muscle  bulk  is  assessed  by  inspection  as  well  as  measurements  at  corresponding  sites  in  the
extremities.
Symmetry is important with consideration given to handedness and overall body habitus.
Wasting  is  considered  if  there  is  >1  cm  reduction  on  the  dominant  extremity  and  >2  cm  in  the
nondominant  extremity.  In  some  areas,  just  inspection  is  adequate  (thenar  eminence,  hypothenar
eminence,  shoulder)  whereas  in  other  areas  (thighs,  legs,  arms  and  forearms)  measurement  is
required.
Measurements of the circumferences of the limb are done at corresponding areas at fixed distances
from  bony  landmarks,  which  are  part  of  that  limb.  Example:  10  cm  below  the  olecranon  [Fig.

6D(iv).1], 10 cm above the medial humeral epicondyle [Fig. 6D(iv).2], 18 cm above the patella, and
10 cm below the tibial tuberosity.

The Split Hand Sign

•
•

•

•
•

It is highly specific for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
It is due to a lesion in the ulnar nerve or the lower trunk, which will cause predominant wasting of first
dorsal interossei and hypothenar muscles with preserved thenar muscles (which are innervated by the
median nerve).
It  is  called  split  hand  sign  as  it  preferentially  affects  lateral  part  of  the  hand  (abductor  pollicis  brevis
and first dorsal interossei) and spares the medial part of the hand.
This pattern of dissociated wasting does not correspond to a nerve or plexus or root distribution.
This  is  in  contrast  to  a  C8-T1  root  lesion,  which  will  cause  wasting  of  both  thenar  and  hypothenar
muscle as both median and ulnar nerves receive C8-T1 innervation.

MUSCLE TONE

Definition

Tone is defined as partial state of contraction of the muscle at rest which is demonstrated by resistance
offered by the muscle to passive movement across the joint.

Tone is examined in the upper limb (wrist and elbow joint) and the lower limb (knee and ankle joint).

Testing for Tone in the Legs [Figs. 6D(iv).6 and 6D(iv).7]

•

•

•

With the patient relaxed, place your hands on the thigh and roll the whole leg. Observe the movement
of the foot
With the patient in a supine position, place your hands behind the patient’s knee, and lift the leg in a
sudden motion. Observe if the heel drags along the bed. With normal muscle tone, the heel will drag
along  the  surface  of  the  bed.  However,  if  there  is  an  increased  tone  or  spasticity,  the  foot  may  not
make contact with the bed.
Alternatively  flex  and  extend  the  knee.  Feel  for  the  extensors  during  flexion  and  flexors  during
extension.

Testing for Tone in the Arms [Figs. 6D(iv).8 to 6D(iv).10]

•
•

Lift the arm and let it drop. See the speed and smoothness.
At the elbow, check for tone in biceps and triceps. Feel the biceps while extending the arm, and feel
the triceps while flexing the arm.

Fig. 6D(iv).6: Assessment of tone in the lower limbs.

Fig. 6D(iv).7: Assessment of tone in the lower limbs.

•

At the wrist, take the hand as if to shake it. First pronate and supinate the forearm. Then roll the hand
around at the wrist. This demonstrates cog wheel rigidity [Fig. 6D(iv).11].

Lower motor neuron (LMN) disease
Cerebellar disease
Hypothyroidism
Upper motor neuron (UMN) disease in a state of neuronal shock
Chorea

Description

•

•

Tone increased in the initial part of movement
followed by sudden release—clasp-knife effect*

•

Increased tone present continuously throughout
the complete range of movement—lead-pipe

Supination-pronation of the forearm will reveal the
so-called supinator catch

•

With associated tremors—cog-wheel**

Muscles
involved

Anti-gravity muscles (flexors in the UL and extensors
in the LL)

Both groups of muscles

Velocity

Velocity dependent (more with fast movements)

Velocity independent

Associated
features

Hyperreflexia, extensor plantar

Tremors, bradykinesia

*Clasp-knife  phenomenon:  The  muscles  at  rest  do  not  have  excessive  tone  but  a  brisk  stretch  will
produce  a  catch  at  about  mid-length  of  the  muscle  followed  by  a  sudden  release  of  the  catch  and

 
relaxation of the muscle. The giving away or the release portion of the clasp-knife phenomenon is due to
the  increased  firing  of  the  inhibitory  Golgi  tendon  organs.  To  elicit  this  phenomenon,  the  clinician
extends the patient’s knee using a constant velocity, but as the patient’s knee nears full extension, the
muscle tone of the quadriceps muscles increases dramatically and completes the movement, just as the
blade of a pocket knife opens under the influence of its spring.
**Cog-wheel rigidity: Lead pipe rigidity superimposed with tremors (Negro sign).

Causes of hypertonia:
•
•
•
•
•
•

UMN disease—pyramidal and extrapyramidal
Tetanus
Tetany
Strychnine poisoning
Tonic phase of seizure
Catatonia (seen in schizophrenia where there is increased tone for all movements)

tone  seen 

in  psychiatric  diseases  and 
Paratonia—altered 
characterized by inability to relax the muscle during muscle tone assessment. Can be of two types:
1.
2.

Oppositional paratonia (Gegenhalten)—where the subjects involuntarily resist passive movements
Facilitatory paratonia (Mitgehen)—where the subject involuntarily assists passive movement.
Paratonia is present in bilateral frontal lobe dysfunction and diffuse cerebellar disorders.

lobe  dysfunction  which 

frontal

Myotonia—Slow  relaxation  of  muscle  after  voluntary  contraction  or  contraction  provoked  by  muscle
percussion.  Examples:  myotonic  dystrophy,  congenital  myotonia,  hypothyroidism,  neuromyotonia
congenita, Issac syndrome [Fig. 6D(iv).12].

Myoedema
Stationary  muscle  mounding  after  muscle  percussion  without  electrical  muscle  activity  is  called
myoedema. Myoedema is due to prolonged muscle contraction caused by delayed calcium reuptake by
sarcoplasmic reticulum, following local calcium ion release brought out by percussion or pressure.

Can be seen in hypothyroidism, chronic debilitating diseases, severe cachexia as in TB.

EXAMINATION FOR SUBTLE HEMIPARESIS [FIG. 6D(IV).58]

1.

Pronator drift (Barre’s sign)
–

The patient stretches out both arms directly in front of him or her with palms upright (i.e. forearms
supinated) and closes his or her eyes.
This position is held for 20–30 seconds.

–

Normal response:
•
•

Palm will remain flat, elbows straight and the limbs horizontal OR
Symmetrical deviation from this position (i.e. on both the sides—dominant hand may pronate slightly more than the non-
dominant hand)

Positive pronator drift: Components of pronator drift as mentioned above are seen in the weaker side (asymmetric response)
which indicates a lesion in contralateral cortex

•
•
•
•
•

Positive with eyes open: Motor deficit
Positive with eyes closed: Sensory deficit (posterior column)
Outward and upward drift: Cerebellar drift
“Updrift” (involved arm rising overhead without patient awareness): Parietal lobe lesions (loss of position sense)
Drift without pronation: Functional upper limb paresis (conversion disorder)

2.

3.

4.

Forearm rolling test [Fig. 6D(iv).59]
–
–
–

The patient bends each elbow and places both forearms parallel to each other.
He or she then rotates the forearms about each other, first in one direction and then the other.
In  the  abnormal  response,  the  forearm  contralateral  to  the  lesion  appears  fixed  while  the  other
arm rotates around it.
Rapid finger tapping test
–

The patient rapidly taps the thumb and index finger repeatedly at a speed of about two taps per
second.
Hemispheric  lesions  cause  the  contralateral  finger  and  thumb  to  tap  more  slowly  and  with
diminished amplitude.

–

Foot tapping test
–

The  seated  patient  taps  one  forefoot  at  a  time  for  10  seconds  on  the  floor,  as  fast  as  possible,
while the heel maintains contact with the floor.
A  discrepancy  of  more  than  five  taps  between  the  left  and  right  foot  indicates  cerebral  disease
contralateral to the slower foot.

D(v). REFLEXES

DEFINITION

A reflex is an involuntary response to a sensory stimulus.

MECHANISM OF REFLEX GENERATION [FIG. 6D(V).1]

Afferent  impulses  arising  in  a  sensory  organ  produce  a  response  in  the  effector  organ.  The  response
can be sensory, motor or autonomic.

It has two components:

Segmental component

Suprasegmental component

It consists of a local reflex center in the spinal cord or
brainstem and its afferent and efferent connections

It is made up of descending central pathways that control, modulate, and
regulate the segmental activity

Diseases may increase the activity of some reflexes, decrease activity of
others, and causes reflexes to appear that are not normally seen

TYPES OF REFLEXES

1.
2.
3.
4.

6.

Deep tendon reflexes (monosynaptic reflex)
Superficial reflex (polysynaptic reflex)
Plantar reflex
Latent reflex
Primitive reflexes
Inverted and perverted reflexes.

GRADING OF REFLEXES (FOR DTR’S) NINDS SCALE

Absent reflex (even after reinforcement)

Present but diminished

Normal

Increased but not necessarily to pathologic degree

Markedly hyperactive, pathologic, often with extrabeats or accompanying sustained clonus

REINFORCEMENT MECHANISM AND METHODS

Grade 0

Grade 1+

Grade 2+

Grade 3+

Grade 4+

Mechanism

Normally, when a muscle spindle is stimulated two kinds of responses are seen via the following nerves:

 
Fig. 6D(v).1: Schematic representation of innervation of muscle fiber and pathways.

Alpha motor neurons

Gamma motor neuron*

Inhibitory neuron

Causes: contraction of Extrafusal fibers
of muscle

Causes: contraction of intrafusal fibers of
muscle

Causes: inhibition of reciprocal muscle
contraction

*Normally  gamma  motor  neurons  are  under  the  inhibitory  control  of  upper  motor  neurons  and
reinforcement maneuvers remove the inhibitory effect on gamma motor neurons [Fig. 6D(v).1].
Note:  Mnemonic—AntiEpileptics  cause  gastro  intestinal  disturbance.  (A:  Alpha  neuron,  E:  Extrafusal
fibers), (G: Gamma neuron, I: Intrafusal fibers).

Reinforcement Maneuvers for Deep Tendon Reflexes (DTRs)

Distraction

Talk to the patient and cause diversion
of thought process

Clenching the teeth or clenching the fist of the other arm [Fig. 6D(v).2]

Traditionally done for upper limb

Jendrassik maneuver (interlocking the flexed fingers of the two hands and pull
one against each other) [Fig. 6D(v).3]

Preferably done for lower limb

Fig. 6D(v).2: Clenching the teeth for reinforcement of upper limb reflexes.

Fig. 6D(v).3: Jendrassik maneuver for reinforcement of lower limb reflexes.

DEEP TENDON REFLEXES

These are monosynaptic reflexes.

Prerequisite for examination:
•
•
•
•

Good knee hammer (preferably Queen Square reflex hammer)
Expose adequately the muscle to be tested
Make sure patient is not anxious
The  muscle  should  be  placed  in  optimum  position,  slightly  on  stretch,  but  with  plenty  of  room  for
contraction.

The most commonly used specialized reflex hammers are grouped into three types by the shape of the head:
triangular/tomahawk shaped (Taylor), T-shaped (Tromner, Buck), or circular (Queen square, Babinski)

Method of elicitation

Normal response

Press the forefinger gently on the biceps tendon in the
antecubital fossa and then strike the finger with the
hammer

Flexion of the elbow with visible contraction of the biceps
muscle

Strike the lower end of the radius about 5 cm above the
wrist and watch for the movement of forearm and
fingers

Contraction of brachioradialis and flexion of elbow

By holding the patient’s hand draw the arm across the
trunk and allow it to lie loosely in the new position. Then
strike the triceps tendon 5 cm above the elbow

Extension of elbow with visible contraction of triceps
muscle

For right-handed examiner, the left arm is under both
the knees in order to flex them together and tap the
patellar tendon lightly on each side and compare the
movements of lower leg and of quadriceps muscle

Extension of the knee and visible contraction of the
quadriceps (in case of lower leg amputation keep finger
just above the patella with legs extended and strike it in
peripheral direction and look for upward pull of patella)

•

Patient’s leg should be externally rotated and slightly
flexed at the knee. Examiner uses the left hand to
dorsiflex the foot. For the left leg move to the other
side of the bed

Plantar flexion of foot and contraction of gastrocnemius

• The Achilles tendon is then struck

Clonus

Clonus  is  a  series  of  rhythmic  involuntary  muscular  contractions  induced  by  the  sudden  passive
stretching of a muscle or tendon.

Clonus

Ankle clonus
[Figs. 6D(v).12A
and B]

Demonstration

Examiner supports the leg, preferably with one hand under the knee, grasps the foot from below with the
other hand, and quickly dorsiflexes the foot while maintaining slight pressure on the sole at the end of the
dorsiflexion
•

The leg and foot should be well relaxed, the knee and ankle in moderate flexion, and the foot slightly
everted
Right ankle clonus is examined by standing on the right side of the patient and left ankle clonus by
standing on the left side
Unsustained clonus fades away after a few beats; sustained clonus persists as long as the examiner
continues to hold slight dorsiflexion pressure on the foot

•

•

Patellar clonus
[(Figs. 6D(v).11A
and B]

Examiner grasps the patella between index finger and thumb and executes a sudden, sharp, downward
thrust, holding downward pressure at the end of the movement

Wrist clonus

Sudden passive extension of the wrist produces wrist clonus

PLANTAR REFLEX AND VARIATIONS

Plantar Reflex

Stroking the plantar surface of foot from the heel forward is normally followed by plantar flexion of foot
and toes.

Babinski Sign

It is the pathologic variation of plantar reflex (i.e. extensor plantar response). It is part of primitive flexion
reflex. In higher vertebrates, the flexion response includes flexion at hip, flexion at knee, and dorsiflexion
of ankle (all of which help in removing the threatened part form danger). Normally the descending motor
pathway suppresses the primitive flexion response.

Elicitation

•

•
•
•

Elicited by stimulating the lateral aspect of the foot, not the sole, beginning about under the lateral malleolus
near the junction of the dorsal and plantar skin, drawing the stimulus from the heel forward to the small toe
The Chaddock is the only alternative toe sign that is truly useful
It may be more sensitive than the Babinski but is less specific
It produces less withdrawal than plantar stimulation

The stimulus moves from the small toe toward the heel

•

•

Dragging the knuckles heavily down the anteromedial surface of the tibia from the infrapatellar region to the
ankle.
The response is slow and often occurs toward the end of stimulation

Deep pressure on Achilles tendon

Squeezing of calf muscles

Pricking dorsum of foot with a pin

Forceful passive plantar flexion at ankle

LATENT REFLEXES OF UPPER LIMB

Reflex

Wartenberg’s
reflex [Fig.
6D(v).25]

Patient’s fingers are interlocked with examiner’s fingers and pulled apart. Normally thumb extends. However
in pyramidal lesions thumb is adducted and flexed. This sign is equivalent of Babinski of lower limb

Elicitation

Hoffman’s reflex
[Fig. 6D(v).26]

Flexion of the interphalangeal joint of middle finger of patient produces flexion response in other fingers along
with adduction of thumb

Tromner’s reflex
[Fig. 6D(v).27]

Examiner holds the patient’s partially extended middle finger, letting the hand dangle, then, with the other
hand, thumps or flicks the finger pad. The response is the same as that in the Hoffmann test

PRIMITIVE REFLEXES

Reflex

Glabellar tap
(Myerson’s sign)
[Fig. 6D(v).28]

Elicitation

Repetitive tapping of the forehead between the eyebrows causing blinking, which usually stops within
few taps. However if blinking persists, it suggests positive frontal release sign.

Note: To avoid visual stimulus bring the hand from above and behind

Palmomental reflex

Radovici
[Fig. 6D(v).29]

•

•

Stroke the thenar eminence in a proximal to distal direction using a sharp object such as the pointed
end of a reflex hammer, key, paper clip, or fingernail and watch for twitch of chin muscle
This reflex does not have any localizing value, and is commonly seen in elderly patients with
degenerative disease of the cortex

Sucking reflex
[Fig. 6D(v).30]

Rooting reflex
[Fig. 6D(v).31]

Pout and snout
reflex

Sucking reflexes may be seen in response to tactile stimulation in the oral region, or in response to the
insertion of an object (for example, a spatula) into the mouth

Rooting responses are seen when the mouth turns towards an object gently stroking the cheek (tactile
rooting), or towards an object (for example, tendon hammer) brought into the patient’s field of view
(visual rooting)

The snout reflex is present when the lips pucker in response to gentle pressure over the nasal philtrum

[Fig. 6D(v).32]

Grasp reflex
[Fig. 6D(v).33]

•

•

If the examiner’s fingers are placed in the patient’s hand, especially between the thumb and forefinger,
or if the palmar skin is stimulated gently, there is slow flexion of the digits
The patient’s fingers may close around the examiner’s fingers

INVERTED AND PERVERTED REFLEXES

Reflex

Description and example

Inverted
reflex

Contractions opposite to that of expected
For example:

An inverted brachioradialis reflex:
•
•
•

When the supinator reflex elicits finger flexion and not elbow flexion
Is associated with an absent biceps jerk and an exaggerated triceps jerk
Is indicative of a spinal cord lesion at C5 or C6, e.g. due to trauma, syringomyelia, or disc prolapse

Inversion of biceps reflex
•

On eliciting bicep reflex the following are noticed:
–
–
Presence of this reflex indicates that the lesion is at the level of C5 segment

There is no flexion at the elbow
But instead there is extension at the elbow due contraction of the triceps muscle

•

Inversion of triceps reflex
With disc protrusions at C6/7 there is a “paradoxical triceps reflex” with forearm muscles acting to flex the elbow
against no triceps resistance

Inversion of knee reflex
•
•
•
•

On eliciting the knee jerk
There is no extension of the knee joint
But instead there is flexion of the knee due to contraction of the hamstring muscles
Presence of this indicates that the lesion is at the level of L3, 4

Perverted
reflex

It is false inverted reflex where there is an alteration in the response rather than true inversion
For example: When supinator jerk is elicited there is a perverted response of finger flexion. (Note: In the presence of
brachioradialis reflex this phenomenon is called as spread of reflex, while in the absent of brachioradialis reflex this is
considered as pseudo inverted reflex or perverted reflex)

Other Causes of Altered Reflexes

Thyroid disease
Woltman’s sign of myxedema, is the delayed relaxation phase of the muscle stretch reflex.
In hypothermia or β-blockade, the relaxation phase of the ankle jerk may be prolonged.

Chorea: “Hung-up” knee jerk is a specific but rarely appreciated clinical sign of Huntington disease (HD) and Sydenham chorea.
During an elicited knee jerk, the extended lower leg may not relax immediately but may remain elevated for several seconds due
to sustained contraction of the quadriceps femoris.

Very brisk reflexes—even with a few beats of clonus can be seen in anxious individuals, as well as in hyperthyroidism and in
tetany.

Electrolyte disturbances
•
•

Absent reflexes is seen with hypermagnesemia.
In the Holmes Adie syndrome, absent deep tendon reflexes are seen.

D(vi). SENSORY SYSTEM EXAMINATION

SENSORY SYSTEM EXAMINATION

Sensations can be grossly divided into primary and secondary modalities

Primary modalities

Secondary modalities (cortical sensation)

Touch
Pressure
Pain
Temperature
Joint position sense
Vibration

Tactile localization
2 point discrimination
Sensory inattention
Stereognosis
Graphesthesia
These require secondary association area in parietal lobe

Note:  When  primary  sensation  are  normal  but  secondary  modalities  are  lost  it  implies  a  parietal  lobe
lesion.

Exteroceptive
system

Proprioceptive
system

Sherrington classification of sensory system

Information about the external environment, including somatosensory functions and special senses

Senses the orientation of the limbs and body in space

Interoceptive system Information about internal functions, blood pressure, or the concentration of chemical constituents in

bodily fluids

PRIMARY MODALITIES

Examination of Exteroceptive System (Spinothalamic Tract)

Pain
•
•

Ask the patient to close his eyes.
Sharp  end  of  pin  is  applied  mildly  sufficient  to  produce  pain  but  not  to  penetrate  the  skin  [Fig.
6D(vi).1].
Compare adjacent normal area and corresponding area on the opposite side.
Indicate whether sensation is normal, decreased (or absent) or increased.
In peripheral nerve disease, there is anesthesia more than analgesia.
In spinal cord disease, there is analgesia more than anesthesia.
Commonly used objects are the safety pin or broken wooden applicator stick.
Avoid too sharp objects and hypodermic needles.
A useful trick is to hold the pin or shaft of the applicator stick lightly between thumb and fingertip and
allow the shaft to slide between fingertip and thumb. This ensures consistent stimulus intensity.

•

Fig. 6D(vi).1: Examination of pin prick sensation.

Temperature [Fig. 6D(vi).2]
•

With  the  patient’s  eyes  closed,  apply  the  warm  and  cold  test  tubes  randomly  over  the  skin  in
dermatomal pattern.
Instruct the patient to say what he feels–hot/cold/no response.
Cold = 5°C to 10°C (41°F to 50°F) (crushed ice can be used).
Warmth = 40°C to 45°C (104°F to 113°F) (warm water can be used).
Temperature much lower or higher than these elicit pain rather than temperature sensations.
In lesions of leprosy, temperature may be lost prior to pain.

With  patient’s  eyes  closed,  gently  touch  the  skin  (preferably  non-hairy  region)  without  exerting
pressure.
Ask the patient whether he can feel the touch.
Tactile response can be graded as per international spinal injury standards as

–

–

0 = absent
1 = altered response (impaired/increased)
2 = normal/intact response.

Examination of Proprioceptive System

Proprioception (Proprioception refers to either the sense of position of a body part or motion of a body part)

Conscious component

Unconscious component

Travels with the fibers subserving fine, discriminative touch.

Via spinocerebellar tract

These include:
Motion
Position
Vibration
Pressure

Examination of different components of proprioception: Joint motion and position:
•
•
•
•

Usually tested together
In the lower extremity [Figs. 6D(vi).5A and B]:
Tested at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe,
In the upper extremity [Figs. 6D(vi).6A to C]:

At one of the distal interphalangeal joints. If these distal joints are normal, there is no need to test

more proximally.
Joint motion:
•
•

Testing is done with the patient’s eyes closed.
It  is  extremely  helpful  to  instruct  the  patient,  eyes  open,  about  the  responses  expected  before
beginning the test.
Show the patient up or down movements and instruct him to reply “up” or “down”.
The  examiner  should  hold  the  patient’s  completely  relaxed  digit  on  the  sides,  away  from  the
neighboring  digits,  parallel  to  the  plane  of  movement,  exerting  as  little  pressure  as  possible  to
eliminate clues from variations in pressure.
The part is then passively moved up or down, and the patient is instructed to indicate the direction of
movement from the last position.
Healthy  young  individuals  can  detect  great  toe  movements  of  about  1  mm,  or  2°  to  3°;  and  in  the
fingers  virtually  invisible  movements,  1°  or  less,  at  the  distal  interphalangeal  joint  are  accurately
detected.

Figs. 6D(vi).6A to C: Examination of joint sense in upper limb.

Position sense:
•

•

Tested by placing the fingers of one of the patient’s hands in a certain position (like “OK” sign) [Fig.
6D(vi).7]  while  his  eyes  are  closed,  and  then  asking  him  to  imitate  it  with  the  other  hand  OR  do
passive movement in one hand and ask the patient to do in similar way in other hand [Fig. 6D(vi).8].
This is sometimes referred to as parietal copy. Light touch can be tested with a wisp of cotton, tissue
paper,  a  feather,  a  soft  brush,  light  stroking  of  the  hairs,  or  even  using  a  very  light  touch  of  the
fingertip. Both parietal lobes (and their connections) must be intact: one side to register the position
and the other side to copy it.

Vibration (pallesthesia) [Figs. 6D(vi).9A to C]: Preferentially using a tuning fork of 128Hz due to slow
decay (256 Hz is used to detect early changes in cases like subacute combined cord degeneration).

Fig. 6D(vi).7: Examination of position sense (OK sign).

•
•

Explain procedure to patient clearly.
Strike  the  tuning  fork  and  place  on  the  forehead  and  explain  the  difference  between  vibration  and
plain touch of tuning fork, by dampening the vibration by holding the prongs.

Fig. 6D(vi).8: Examination of position sense by asking to copy passive movement.

Fig. 6D(vi).9A: Demonstration of vibration over proximal great toe.

Fig. 6D(vi).9B: Demonstration of vibration over medial malleolus.

•
•

Keep the vibrating tuning fork, starting from the distal most bony prominence and proceed proximally.
Ask the patient to say when he ceases to feel the vibration.

Timed vibration test:
•
•
•

It is the most sensitive and simple method to quantify defects in vibration.
Note the time duration of perception of vibration after the tuning fork is set into vibration.
Normally

–
–

≥10 sec in lower limb.
≥20 sec in upper limb.

Rhomberg’s sign [Figs. 6D(vi).10A and B]:
It is a sign of posterior column dysfunction.
•
Ask the patient to stand upright with feet/heels close together, arms by the side and eyes open.
•
Any significant swaying is noted.
•
Now, ask the patient to close the eyes while taking adequate measures to make sure patient does not
•
fall and hurt himself.
Watch for swaying

•

–

Minimal swaying is normal.

–

Immediate gross swaying is considered as positive test.

Pseudoathetosis [Fig. 6D(vi).11]:
•
•
•

It is an upper limb equivalent of examination of posterior column dysfunction.
Ask the patient to hold the upper limb in extended position and close the eyes.
Watch for slow writhing movements of fingers (piano-playing movement) which disappear on opening
the eyes.

Pressure pain:
•
•

Tested by squeezing the Achilles tendon or calf muscle.
Abadie’s  sign  is  loss  of  deep  pain  (seen  with  diseases  affecting  the  posterior  column  like
neurosyphilis–tabes dorsalis).

SECONDARY MODALITIES

Cortical Sensations

Cortical sensations cannot reliably be tested unless primary sensation is intact bilaterally.
Two-point  discrimination [Fig.  6D(vi).12]:  Ability  to  recognize  simultaneous  stimulation  by  two  blunt
points. Measured by the distance between the points required for recognition. The normal distances at
which two points can be discriminated on various body parts:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Tongue tip: 1 mm
Fingertip: 2 to 4 mm
Dorsum of fingers: 4 to 6 mm
Palm: 8 to 12 mm
Dorsum of hand: 20 to 30 mm
Skin over the back : 30–40 mm.

Tactile localization (topognosis):
Ability to localize stimuli to parts of the body. Topagnosia is the absence of this ability.

Graphesthesia [Fig. 6D(vi).13]:
Ask the patient to close their eyes and identify letters or numbers that are being traced onto their palm
or the tip of their finger.

Stereognosis [Figs. 6D(vi).14A and B]:
Ask the patient to close their eyes and identify various objects by touch using one hand at a time.

Tactile extinction (double simultaneous stimulation) [Figs. 6D(vi).15A and B]
•

Ability to perceive a sensory stimulus when corresponding areas on the opposite side of the body are
stimulated simultaneously. Loss of this ability is termed sensory extinction (perceptual rivalry/sensory
suppression).
The site of lesion is contralateral parietal lobe.

D(vii). CEREBELLUM AND COORDINATION

SIGNS OF CEREBELLAR DISORDERS

Deficit

Manifestation

Ataxia

Reeling, wide-based gait.

Decomposition of
movement

Inability to sequence fine, coordinate acts correctly.
This is usually tested while performing the finger-nose test which requires a fine coordination between
shoulder, elbow, and wrist joint. Patients with a cerebellar lesion will find it difficult to perform such
movements.

Dysarthria

Inability to articulate words correctly, usually manifesting as slurring and/or inappropriate phrasing.

Dysdiadochokinesia Inability to perform rapid, alternating movements.

Dysmetria

Inability to control or limit the range of movement.

Hypotonia

Decrease in muscle tone.

Nystagmus

Involuntary rapid oscillation of eyeballs in a horizontal, vertical or rotationary fashion with the fast
component of nystagmus maximal towards the side of the cerebellar lesion.

Scanning/Staccato
speech

Slow explosive enunciation with a tendency to hesitate at the beginning of each word or each syllable.
Asking the patient to pronounce a word with multiple syllables, such as Mississippi or Venkataramana will
elicit distinct pauses before each syllable.

Tremor

Rhythmic, alternating, oscillatory movements which affects a limb as it approaches a target (Intention
tremor) or of proximal musculature when attempting to bear weight (postural tremor).

Hypotonia
•
•
•
•
•

Usually accompanies acute hemispheric lesions.
Interestingly, it is seen less often in chronic lesions.
Ipsilateral to the side of a cerebellar lesion.
More noticeable in upper limbs and proximal muscles.
Pendular knee jerk: Leg keeps swinging after knee jerk more than 4 times (4 or less is considered normal).

•

–
–
Heel-to-shin test
–
–
–
–

Ataxia
•
•
•

Defective timing of sequential contraction of agonist/antagonist muscles.
Results in a disturbance in smooth performance of voluntary acts (errors in rate, range, force, duration).
May affect limbs, trunk, gait (depends on the part of cerebellum involved).

Asynergia
Lack of synergy of various muscles while performing complex movements (movements are broken up into isolated, successive
parts. This is known as decomposition of movement).

Dysmetria OR abnormal excursions in movement
•

Finger-to-nose test
–

With eyes open, the patient is asked to partially extend elbow and rapidly bring tip of index finger in a wide arc to tip of his
nose.
In cerebellar disease, the action may manifest an intention tremor.
With eyes closed, sense of position in the shoulder and elbow is tested.

Patient is asked to place one heel on opposite knee and slide the heel down the tibia with foot dorsiflexed.
Movement should be performed accurately.
In cerebellar disease, the arc of the movement is jerky/wavering.
The slide down the shin may manifest an action tremor.

Dysdiadochokinesia OR impaired performance of rapidly alternating movement
Normal coordination includes ability to arrest one motor impulse and substitute the opposite.
There are several simple clinical methods to test this:
•

Alternating movements (pronate and supinate forearm and hand quickly): In cerebellar disease, the movements tend to
overshoot or are inadequate resulting in irregular or inaccurate movements.
Rapidly tap fingers on the table.
Open and close fists.
Stewart-Holmes rebound sign.

•
•
•
Have the patient pull on your hand and when they do, slip your hand out of their grasp. Normally the antagonists muscles will
contract and stop their arm from moving in the desired direction. A positive sign is seen in a spastic limb where the exaggerated
“rebound” occurs with movement in the opposite direction. However, in cerebellar disease, this response is completely absent
causing the limb to continue moving in the desired direction. (Be careful that you protect the patient from the unrestricted
movement causing them to strike themselves).

Past pointing
Overshoot is also commonly seen as part of ataxic movements and is sometimes referred to as past pointing, when the patient
overshoots while reaching target (finger-to-nose test)

Cerebellar dysarthria
•
•
•
•

Abnormalities in articulation and prosody (together or independent).
Scanning, slurring, staccato, explosive, hesitant, garbled speech.
Hemisphere lesions are associated with speech disorders more often than vermal lesions.
Causes enunciation of individual syllables: “the British Parliament” becomes “the Brit-tish Par-la-ment.”

Intention tremor—occurs during goal-directed movements. Intention tremor results when the antagonist activation that normally
stops a goal-directed movement as the goal is approached is inappropriately sized or timed.

Oculomotor dysfunction
•
•

Nystagmus frequently seen in cerebellar disorders.
Gaze-evoked nystagmus, upbeat nystagmus, rebound nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus may all be seen in midline cerebellar
lesions.

Gait
•
•
•
•

In cerebellar disease, the gait is staggering/lurching/wavering.
Lesion in mid-cerebellum: Movements are in all directions.
Lesion in lateral cerebellum: Staggering/falling is toward the side of the lesion.
Somewhat steadied by standing or walking on a wide base.

Position of feet
Ataxia from cerebellar disease is less when the patient stands on a broad base (feet widely apart).
Eyes open or closed
Cerebellar ataxia is not improved by visual orientation; ataxia from posterior column disease (disordered proprioception) is
worsened with the eyes closed.
Direction of Falling

Disease of lateral lobe of cerebellum causes falling to ipsilateral side.
Lesions of midline/vermis cause indiscriminate falling depending on initial stance of the patient.

Titubation
Consists of a rhythmic body or head tremor. There is a rotatory, rocking or bobbing movement. Clinically, this does not have
significant value in localizing the lesion with respect to the part of the cerebellum involved.

HEEL KNEE TEST [FIGS. 6D(VII).1A TO D]

The patient is asked to touch the heel of one foot to the opposite knee and then to drag their heel in a
straight line all the way down the front of their shin and back up again. In order to eliminate the effect of
gravity in moving the heel down the shin, this test should always be done in the supine position.

Figs. 6D(vii).1A to D: Demonstration of heel knee test.

TOE FINGER TEST [FIGS. 6D(VII).2A AND B]

Patient lies in bed and is asked to touch his great toe to the examiners fingers or any object held above
the bed within his reach.

Nose-finger-nose  test  [Figs.  6D(vii).3A  to  E]  in  which  the  patient  is  asked  to  alternately  touch  their
nose and the examiner’s finger as quickly as possible. Abnormality of this is called as dysmetria.

FOOT TAPPING/FOOT PAT TEST [FIGS. 6D(VII).7A TO C)]

Patient  is  made  to  sit  on  chair  with  feet  touching  the  floor  flat.  He  is  asked  to  pat  the  floor  with  his
forefoot.  The  rate,  rhythm  and  speed  of  patting  is  compared  on  both  sides.  Even  minimum  cerebellar
disease can be picked up by this test.

Figs. 6D(vii).8A and B: Straight line walking.

TANDEM WALKING [FIGS.6D(VII).9A AND B]

Figs. 6D(vii).9A and B: Demonstration of tandem walking.

ROMBERG TEST [FIGS. 6D(VII).10A AND B]

Patient  stands  still  with  their  heels  together.  Ask  the  patient  to  remain  still  and  close  their  eyes.  If  the
patient loses their balance immediately, the test is positive.

To  achieve  balance,  a  person  requires  2  out  of  the  following  3  inputs  to  the  cortex:  1.  Visual
confirmation  of  position,  2.  Nonvisual  confirmation  of  position  (including  proprioceptive  and  vestibular
input), and 3. A normally functioning cerebellum.

Therefore,  if  a  patient  loses  their  balance  after  standing  still  with  their  eyes  closed,  and  is  able  to

maintain balance with their eyes open, then there is likely to be lesion in sensory input.

Sensory  ataxia  is  due  to  a  severe  sensory  neuropathy,  ganglionopathy  or  lesions  of  the  posterior
column  of  the  spinal  cord,  e.g.  Sjogren’s  syndrome,  cisplatin,  chronic  inflammatory  demyelinating
polyradiculoneuropathy  (CIDP),  paraneoplastic  disorders,  subacute  combined  degeneration  (SACD),
tabes dorsalis, Miller Fischer syndrome, celiac disease.
•

Ataxia more at night or while walking through narrow passages (coffee plantations).

•

•

A  history  of  falling  into  the  sink  or  imbalance  when  splashing  water  on  the  face  (wash-basin  sign),
passing a towel over the face or pulling a shirt over the head should also be sought.
Pseudoathetosis–”piano-playing” movements—when the patient has his arms outstretched and eyes
closed, the affected arm will wander from its original position.
Vibration and position sense are usually lost together.
Positive Romberg’s test is a hallmark of sensory ataxia.

•
•
Vestibular  ataxia  is  due  to  lesion  of  vestibular  pathways  resulting  in  impairment  and  imbalance  of
vestibular inputs, e.g. vestibular, neuronitis, and streptomycin toxicity.
•
•
Optic ataxia was first described in a man with lesions of the posterior parietal lobe on both sides of the
brain, later known as Balint syndrome.
•

Vertigo and associated tinnitus and hearing loss.
Direction of the nystagmus is away from the lesion.

Among  the  symptoms  that  characterize  the  syndrome  are  a  restriction  of  visual  attention  to  single
objects and a paucity of spontaneous eye movements.
Patients have difficulty in completing visually guided reaching tasks in the absence of other sensory
cues.

•

Frontal  lobe  ataxia  (Brun’s  ataxia)  is  due  to  involvement  of  subcortical  small  vessels,  Binswanger’s
disease, multi infarct state or normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
•

The  gait  may  appear  to  be  a  combination  of  awkward,  magnetic  (stuck  to  the  floor),  cautious,  slow,
and  shuffling.  This  is  also  known  as  a  frontal  gait  disorder,  referring  to  the  frontal  lobe  conditions
which often cause gait apraxia.

NORMAL GAIT CYCLE [FIGS. 6D(VIII).1A TO G]

The  gait  cycle  is  the  time  interval  or  sequence  of  motions  occurring  between  two  consecutive  initial
contacts of the same foot, i.e. cycle of stance and swing by one foot.

ABNORMALITIES OF GAIT

Neurogenic  gait  disorders  should  be  differentiated 
(characterized by pain producing an antalgic gait, or limp).

from 

those  due 

to  skeletal  abnormalities

Gait abnormalities incompatible with any anatomical or physiological deficit may be due to functional

disorders.

Pyramidal (Circumduction/Hemiplegic) Gait [Fig. 6D(viii).2]

•

•

Lesions of the upper motor neuron lesions produce characteristic extension of the affected leg. There
is  tendency  for  the  toes  to  strike  the  ground  on  walking  and  outward  throwing/swing  of  lower  limbs.
This  movement  occurring  at  the  hip  joint  is  called  circumduction.  There  is  leaning  towards  the
opposite  normal  side.  The  arm  of  the  affected  side  is  adducted  at  the  shoulder  and  flexed  at  the
elbow, wrist, and fingers.
In hemiplegia/hemiparesis, there is a clear asymmetry between affected and normal sides on walking,
but in paraparesis both lower legs swing slowly from the hips in extension and are stiffly dragged over
the ground (walking in mud).

Fig. 6D(viii).2: Circumduction gait.

Foot Drop (High Stepping/Slapping Gait) [Fig. 6D(viii).3]

In  normal  walking,  the  heel  is  the  first  part  of  the  foot  to  hit  the  ground.  A  lower  motor  neuron  lesion
affecting the leg will cause weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, resulting in a less controlled descent of the
foot,  which  makes  slapping  noise  as  it  hits  the  ground.  In  severe  cases,  the  foot  will  have  to  be  lifted
higher  at  the  knee  to  allow  room  for  the  inadequately  dorsiflexed  foot  to  swing  through,  resulting  in  a
high-stepping gait. Cause, e.g. common peroneal nerve palsy.

Fig. 6D(viii).3: High stepping gait.

Myopathic Gait/Waddling Gait [Fig. 6D(viii).4]

•

•

During  walking,  alternating  transfer  of  the  body’s  weight  through  each  leg,  needs  adequate  hip
abduction.
Causes:  Weakness  of  proximal  lower  limb  muscles  (e.g.  polymyositis  and  muscular  dystrophy)
causes  difficulty  rising  from  sitting.  The  hips  are  not  properly  fixed  by  these  muscles  and  trunk
movements are exaggerated, and walking becomes a waddle or rolling. The pelvis is poorly supported

by each leg. This may be seen with bilateral congenital dislocation of hip (Trendelenburg gait).  The
patient walks on a broad base with exaggerated lumbar lordosis.

Gluteus Medius Gait or Abductor Lurch

Lurch of body towards affected side in every stance phase (abductor lurch). Seen with congenital coxa
vara, gluteus medius paralysis, polio, and Perthes disease.

Fig. 6D(viii).4: Waddling gait.

Ataxic Gait (Cerebellar Ataxia: Broad-based Gait) [Fig. 6D(viii).5]

•

•

In this type of gait, the patient, unstable, tremulous and reels in any direction (including backwards)
and  walks  on  a  broad  base.  Ataxia  describes  this  incoordination.  The  patient  finds  difficulty  in
executing tandem walking.
Causes:  Lesions  of  the  cerebellum,  vestibular  apparatus  or  peripheral  nerves.  When  walking,  the
patient tends to veer to the side of the affected cerebellar lobe. When the disease involves cerebellar
vermis,  the  trunk  becomes  unsteady  without  limb  ataxia,  with  a  tendency  to  fall  backwards  or
sideways and is termed truncal ataxia.

Fig. 6D(viii).5: Cerebellar/ataxic gait.

Apraxic Gait

•

•

In an apraxic gait, the acquired walking skills become disorganized. On examination of the legs, the
power,  cerebellar  function,  and  proprioception  are  normal.  Leg  movement  is  normal  when  sitting  or
lying  and  the  patient  can  carry  out  complex  motor  tasks  (e.g.  bicycling  motion).  But  patient  cannot
initiate  and  organize  the  motor  act  of  walking.  The  feet  appear  stuck  to  the  floor  and  the  patient
cannot walk.
Causes:  Diffuse  bilateral  hemisphere  disease  or  diffuse 
hydrocephalus, and infarction).

lobe  disease  (e.g. 

frontal 

tumor,

Marche à petits pas

•

•

It is characterized by small, slow steps, and marked instability. In contrast to the festination found in
Parkinson’s disease, it lacks increasing pace and freezing.
Cause: Small-vessel cerebrovascular disease and accompanying bilateral upper motor neuron signs.

Extrapyramydal/Shuffling/Festinant Gait [Fig. 6D(viii).6]

•

•

It  is  characterized  by  stooped  posture  and  gait  difficulties  with  problems  initiating  walking  and
controlling the pace of the gait. Patients make a series of small, flat footed shuffles, and become stuck
while trying to start walking or when walking through doorways (freezing). The center of gravity will be
moved  forwards  to  aid  propulsion  and  difficulty  in  stopping.  It  is  characterized  by  muscular  rigidity
throughout extensors and flexors. Power is preserved, pace is shortened and slows to a shuffle, and
its base remains narrow. There is a stoop and diminished arm swinging and gait becomes festinant
(hurried)  with  short  rapid  steps.  Patient  will  be  having  difficulty  in  turning  quickly  and  initiating
movement. Retropulsion, i.e. small backward steps are taken involuntarily when a patient halts.
Cause: Parkinsonism.

[Kinesia paradoxa—presented in Parkinson’s disease patients, who generally cannot move but under
certain circumstances of need exhibit a sudden, brief period of mobility (walking or even running)]

Scissoring Gait [Figs. 6D(viii).7A and B]

Seen classically with cerebral palsy due to bilateral spasticity.

Sensory Ataxia: Stamping Gait [Fig. 6D(viii).8]

•

•

It  is  characterized  by  broad  based,  high  stepping,  stamping  gait,  and  ataxia  due  to  loss  of
proprioception (position sense). This type of ataxia becomes more prominent by removal of sensory
input (e.g. walks with eyes closed) and becomes worse in the dark. Romberg’s test is positive.
Cause: Peripheral sensory (large fiber) lesions (e.g. polyneuropathy), posterior column lesion (vitamin
B12 deficiency or tabes dorsalis).

Figs. 6D(viii).7A and B: Scissoring gait.

Choreiform Gait (Hyperkinetic Gait)

Fig. 6D(viii).8: Sensory ataxia.

The  patient  will  display  irregular,  jerky,  and  involuntary  movements  in  all  extremities.  Walking  may
accentuate their baseline movement disorder.
Cause: Sydenham’s chorea, Huntington’s disease, and other forms of chorea, athetosis or dystonia.

•

•

Antalgic or Painful Gait

Decreased duration of stance phase as the painful limb is unable to bear full weight. It is seen in any
painful lesion of the lower extremity, i.e. foot, knee, and hip.

Coxalgic Gait [Figs. 6D(viii).9A and B]

In patients with hip pain, the upper trunk is typically shifted towards the affected side during the stance
phase on the affected leg. This is an unconscious adaptive maneuver which reduces the force exerted
on the affected hip during the stance phase.

Figs. 6D(viii).9A and B: Trendelenburg gait versus coxalgic gait.

Toe-walking or Equinus Gait

Heel  strike  is  avoided.  It  is  seen  in  patients  with  heel  pain,  clubfoot,  congenital  short  Achilles  tendon,
and cerebral palsy.

Quadriceps Weakness Gait

Inability to maintain knee extension at heel-strike and patient may push on thigh to extend the knee and
lock. It is seen in quadriceps paralysis.

Astasia-Abasia

It is a psychogenic pattern of walking in which the patient seems to alternate between a broad base for
stability  and  a  narrow,  tightrope-like  stance,  with  contortions  of  the  trunk,  and  limbs  that  give  the
appearance of an imminent fall.

Alderman’s Gait

Patient walks with chest and head thrown backwards with protuberant abdomen and legs thrown wide
apart. It is seen in tuberculosis of lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebra.

BEDSIDE TESTS TO DIAGNOSE PES CAVUS AND PES PLANUS

Wet Test [Fig. 6D(viii).10]

There are three basic foot types, each based on the height of the arches. The quickest and easiest way
to determine your foot type is by taking the “wet test,” below. (1) Pour a thin layer of water into a shallow
pan.  (2)  Wet  the  sole  of  your  foot.  (3)  Step  onto  a  shopping  bag  or  a  blank  piece  of  heavy  paper.  (4)
Step off and look down. Observe the shape of your foot

MOVEMENT DISORDERS

Dyskinesia  is  abnormal  uncontrolled  movement  and  is  a  common  symptom  of  many  movement
disorders [Flowcharts 6D(ix).1 and 6D(ix).2].
Movement disorders disrupt motor function by:
1.
2.

Abnormal, involuntary, unwanted movements (hyperkinetic movement disorders).
Curtailing  (restricting)  the  amount  of  normal  free  flowing,  fluid  movement  (hypokinetic  movement
disorders).

TREMOR

Tremor: Series of involuntary, relatively rhythmic, purposeless, oscillatory movements due to intermittent
muscle contractions:
•
•

Simple tremor involves only a single muscle group
Compound tremor involves several muscle groups

–
–

Several elements in combination
Resulting in a series of complex movements

•
•
•
•

May be unilateral or bilateral
Most commonly involves distal parts of the extremities—fingers or hands
May also affect the arms, feet, legs, tongue, eyelids, jaw, and head
May occasionally involve the entire body

–

–
–

Rate may be slow, medium, or fast
Slow: Oscillations of 3 to 5 Hz
»
»
Rapid: Oscillations of 10 to 20 Hz
Amplitude may be fine, coarse, or medium
The relationship to rest or activity is the basis for classification into two primary tremor types:
»
»

Resting
Action

•
•
•

Tremors are present mainly during relaxation (e.g. with the hands in the lap)
Attenuate when the part is used
Rest tremor is seen primarily in PD and other Parkinsonian syndromes

Resting (Static)

Action Tremors

Kinetic tremor: Appears when making a voluntary
movement
May occur at the beginning, during or at the end of the
movement. For example, intention (terminal) tremor
seen primarily in cerebellar disease

Task specific tremor: Occurs when
performing highly skilled, goal-oriented tasks.
For example, while writing or speaking

Postural tremors
become evident when
the limbs are:
Maintained in an
antigravity position
(e.g. arms
outstretched)
Types of postural
tremor:
•

Enhanced
physiological tremor
(EPT)
Essential tremor
(ET)

•

CHOREA

•
•
•

Characterized by involuntary, irregular, purposeless, random, nonrhythmic hyperkinesias.
Movements are spontaneous, abrupt, brief, rapid, jerky, and unsustained.
Movements are actually random and aimless:

–

Rather than disrupting a voluntary task, it appears as if fragments of movements intrude; in some
cases,  there  is  loss  of  motor  tone,  known  as  “motor  impersistence”,  which  appears  due  to
lapses in the ability to perform desired action.

•

•

When asked to hold the hands outstretched, there may be constant random movements of individual
fingers (piano-playing movements).
If  the  patient  holds  the  examiner’s  finger  in  her  fist,  there  are  constant  twitches  of  individual  fingers
(milkmaid grip):

–

“Jack in the box” tongue/ harlequin’s tongue: Patient is unable to maintain tongue in protruded
state and the tongue moves in and out.

•

Blink rate is increased.

Causes

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hereditary: Huntington’s disease, benign chorea
Drugs: Antiparkinsonian drugs, oral contraceptives
Toxin: Alcohol, carbon monoxide poisoning
Infections: Sydenham’s chorea, encephalitis
Metabolic: Hyperthyroidism, hypocalcemia
Immunological: SLE, polyarteritis nodosa
Vascular
Pregnancy (Chorea gravidarum)

ATHETOSIS

•
•
•
•

Involuntary, irregular, coarse, somewhat rhythmic, and writhing or squirming in character (twisting).
Hyperkinesias are slower, more sustained, and larger in amplitude than those in chorea.
May involve the extremities, face, neck, and trunk.
In the extremities, they affect mainly the distal portions, the fingers, hands, and toes:
Affected limbs are in constant motion (athetosis means “without fixed position”)
Choreoathetosis  refers  to  movements  that  lie  between  chorea  and  athetosis  in  rate  and
rhythmicity, and may represent a transitional form.

–

Causes

•
•

Cerebral palsy
Congenital due to perinatal injury to the basal ganglia.

HEMIBALLISMUS

Dramatic  neurologic  syndrome  of  wild,  flinging  (forceful),  incessant  (uninterrupted  or  continuous)
movements that occur on one side of the body.

Due to infarction or hemorrhage in the region of the contralateral subthalamic nucleus.

•
•
•

•
•

More rapid and forceful
Involve the proximal portions of the extremities.
When  fully  developed,  there  are  continuous,  violent,  swinging,  flinging,  rolling,  throwing,  flailing
(thrashing) movements of the involved extremities.
They are usually unilateral, and involve one entire half of the body.
Rarely, they are bilateral (biballismus or paraballismus) or involve a single extremity (monoballismus).

MYOCLONUS

Single  or  repetitive,  abrupt,  brief,  rapid,  lightning-like,  jerky,  arrhythmic,  asynergic,  involuntary
contractions, involving portions of muscles, entire muscles, or groups of muscles.
•

Seen  principally  in  the  muscles  of  the  extremities  and  trunk,  but  the  involvement  is  often  multifocal,
diffuse, or widespread.

•
•

May involve the facial muscles, jaws, tongue, pharynx, and larynx.
Myoclonus may appear symmetrically on both sides. Such synchrony may be an attribute unique to
myoclonus.

Myoclonus has been classified in numerous ways including the following:

    i.
   ii.
  iii.
  iv.
   v.
  vi.

Positive versus negative;
Epileptic versus nonepileptic;
Stimulus sensitive (reflex) versus spontaneous;
Rhythmic versus arrhythmic;
Anatomically (peripheral, spinal, segmental, brainstem, or cortical)
By etiology (physiologic, essential, epileptic, and symptomatic)

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Encephalitis
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME, Janz syndrome)
Drug overdose
Hypnic jerks (appear during the process of falling asleep)
Hiccup
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
Anoxic encephalopathy (Lance-Adams syndrome)

TIC

A  “tic”  is  an  involuntary  movement  or  vocalization  that  is  usually  sudden  onset,  brief,  repetitive,
stereotyped but nonrhythmical in character, can be suppressed.

Types

Motor tics are associated with movements. Categorized as simple or complex.

Simple motor tics involve only a few muscles usually restricted to a specific body part.

•

Examples of simple motor tics include: Eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, neck stretching, mouth movements,
jaw clenching, and spitting.

Vocal/phonic tics are associated with sound
Simple vocal tics consist of sounds that do not form words, such as, throat clearing, grunting, coughing, and sniffing.

Common complex vocal tics include: Repeating words or phrases out of context.

•
•
•

Coprolalia: Use of socially unacceptable words, frequently obscene.
Palilalia: Repeating one’s own sounds or words.
Echolalia: Repeating the last-heard sound, word, or phrase.

Gilles de la Tourette syndrome—associated with chronic motor and phonic tics.

DYSTONIA

•

•

•

Refers  to  a  syndrome  of  involuntary  sustained  or  spasmodic  muscle  contractions  involving
cocontraction of the agonist and the antagonist.
The  movements  are  usually  slow  and  sustained,  and  they  often  occur  in  a  repetitive  and  patterned
manner.
They can be unpredictable and fluctuate.

Partial or focal

Generalized

•
•
•
•
•

Spasmodic torticollis
Blepharospasm
Oromandibular dystonia
Writers cramp
Hemiplegic dystonia after stroke

•
•
•
•

Dystonia musculorum deformans (idiopathic torsion dystonia)
Dopamine responsive dystonia: In childhood and generally involves the legs only.
Drug-induced dystonia (metoclopramide, phenothiazine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine)
Symptomatic dystonia (after encephalitis, Wilsons disease)

Blepharospasm and Oromandibular Dystonia

Involuntary prolonged tight eye closure (blepharospasm) is associated with dystonia of mouth, tongue or
jaw muscles (jaw clenching and tongue protrusion).

Writer’s Cramp = Mogigraphia = Scrivener’s Palsy

Symptoms usually appear when a person is trying to do a task that requires fine motor movements such
as writing or playing a musical instrument.

MYOKYMIA

Myokymia,  a  form  of  involuntary  muscular  movement,  usually  can  be  visualized  on  the  skin  as
vermicular or continuous rippling movements.

AKATHISIA

Akathisia  is  a  movement  disorder  characterized  by  a  feeling  of  inner  restlessness  and  a  compelling
need to be in constant motion, as well as by actions such as:
•
•
•

Rocking while standing or sitting.
Lifting the feet as if marching on the spot.
Crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting.

RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME/“EKBOM’S SYNDROME”

•
•
•

Spontaneous, continuous leg movements associated with paresthesia.
These sensations occur only at the rest and relieved by movement.
Causes: Familial, lumbar root disease, polyneuropathy, renal failure, and iron deficiency.

SYNKINESIS/MIRROR MOVEMENTS

Mirror  movements  are  characterized  by  involuntary  movements  on  one  side  of  the  body  mirroring
voluntary movements of the other side.

FASCICULATIONS

Fasciculations  are  visible,  fine  and  fast,  sometimes  vermicular  contractions  of  fine  muscle  fibers  that
occur  spontaneously  and  intermittently  but  usually  do  not  generate  sufficient  force  to  move  a  limb.
Described as verminosis, because they look like worms moving below the dermis.

Involuntary contraction of the muscle fibers innervated by a motor unit.

Causes of Fasciculations

Fasciculations in healthy
subjects

Coffee; exhaustive physical activity/fatigue; stress; benign fasciculations

D(x). MENINGEAL SIGNS, SKULL, AND SPINE

SIGNS OF MENINGEAL IRRITATION

Nuchal Rigidity/Meningeal Stiffness

Meningeal tightness is a contracture of the paravertebral muscles, a defense against the secondary pain
stemming from inflammation of the meninges.

Painful and permanent, it sometimes presents with the subject lying down, curled up with his or her
back  to  the  light,  head  back,  and  extremities  half-bent.  All  attempts  to  flex  the  head  provoke
insurmountable  and  painful  resistance.  There  is  extreme  neck  stiffness;  rotational  and  side-to-side
movements are possible but aggravate the headache [Fig. 6D(x).1].

Fig. 6D(x).1: Examination of neck stiffness.

In Kernig’s sign, patient is kept in supine position, hip and knee are flexed to a right angle, and then
knee is slowly extended by the examiner. The appearance of resistance or pain during extension of the
patient’s knees beyond 135° constitutes a positive Kernig’s sign [Figs. 6D(x).2 and 6D(x).3].

Brudzinski’s Sign

Josef  Brudzinski  described  4  maneuvers  for  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  meningitis:  The  cheek  sign,
symphyseal sign, Brudzinski’s leg sign/reflex, and Brudzinski’s neck sign.

1 The cheek sign A positive cheek sign is elicited by applying pressure on both cheeks inferior to the zygomatic arch that

leads to spontaneous flexion of the forearm and arm

2 Symphyseal
sign [Fig.
6D(x).4]

3 Brudzinski’s

leg sign/reflex
[Fig. 6D(x).5]

4 Brudzinski’s
neck sign
[Figs. 6D(x).6
and 6D(x).7]

A positive symphyseal sign occurs when pressure applied to the pubic symphysis elicits a reflex hip and
knee flexion and abduction of the leg

Brudzinski’s contralateral reflex sign consists of reflex flexion of a lower extremity after passive flexion of
the opposite extremity

Brudzinski’s neck sign is performed with the patient in the supine position. The examiner keeps one hand
behind the patient’s head and the other on chest in order to prevent the patient from rising. Reflex flexion of
the patient’s hips and knees after passive flexion of the neck constitutes a positive Brudzinski’s sign

Fig. 6D(x).2: Demonstration of Kernig’s sign.

Fig. 6D(x).3: Illustration of Kernig’s sign.

Fig. 6D(x).7: Brudzinski’s neck sign.

Fig. 6D(x).4: Symphyseal sign.

Fig. 6D(x).5: Brudzinski’s leg sign/reflex.

Fig. 6D(x).8: Tripod sign (Amoss’s sign).

Fig. 6D(x).6: Illustration of Brudzinski’s sign.

Tripod sign, also known as the “Amoss’s sign”, is a useful sign of meningeal irritation.
The patient is asked to sit up in bed. This action requires active movement involving flexion of the
neck.  Although  a  normal  patient  sits  up  without  supporting  himself,  a  patient  with  meningeal  irritation
tries  to  sit  up  by  supporting  himself  with  his  hands  placed  far  behind  him  in  the  bed  (like  a  tripod),  in
order to take the weight off the spine and prevent its flexion [Fig. 6D(x).8]. Severe meningeal irritation
may result in the patient assuming the tripod position with the knees and hips flexed, the back arched
lordotically, the neck extended, and the arms brought back in a plane posterior to the pelvis to support
the thorax.

MENINGISM

Meningism,  also  called  meningismus  or  pseudomeningitis,  is  a  set  of  symptoms  similar  to  those  of
meningitis  but  not  caused  by  meningitis.  Whereas  meningitis  is  inflammation  of  the  meninges
(membranes that cover the central nervous system), meningism is caused by nonmeningitic irritation of
the meninges usually associated with acute febrile illness, especially in children and adolescents.

Tests

“Spoon test”: A kitchen soup spoon, with its curved surface resting on the skin, was held between the
thumb and forefinger, and was drawn slowly on the skin, using sufficient energy to overcome its weight
without lifting it from the skin. When “sympathectomized” skin was crossed, the pull was smooth and
unopposed; but where sweat gland innervation and sympathetic function was intact, the skin was moist,
and the flow of the spoon was interrupted, and became sticky requiring readjustment of the strength of
pull

“Sustained handgrip test (SHT): This parameter indicates cardiac sympathetic response and DBP
response to the sustained handgrip test—taken as the difference between the DBP just before release
of handgrip and the mean of three resting DBP readings. The change in mean DBP in response to
sustained handgrip test was interpreted as:

Head-Up Tilt-Table Testing

The  patient  lies  supine  on  the  tilt  table.  Beat-to-beat  and  oscillometric  BP  instruments  are  attached  to
each arm. ECG monitoring should take place throughout the test. Once the patient is comfortable, with
feet resting on the footboard, a baseline BP is recorded for at least 3 minutes. The patient is then slowly
tilted upright to an angle of 60–80°.

During  testing,  the  patient  is  asked  to  report  any  symptoms.  Both  BP  and  HR  are  recorded

throughout tilt-table testing, after which the patient is returned to a horizontal supine position.

Three  well-described  patterns  of  neurally-mediated  syncope  can  occur  during  head-up  tilt-table

testing:
1.
2.

Vasodepression resulting in hypotension without bradycardia.
Cardioinhibition  with  a  marked  bradycardia  (fewer  than  40  beats/min)  with  or  without  significant
hypotension.
Mixed, with both bradycardia and hypotension.

3.

Valsalva Ratio

The Valsalva maneuver consists of respiratory strain which increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal
pressures and alters hemodynamic and cardiac functions.
•
•

The patient is supine or with head slightly elevated to about 30°.
Have  the  patient  strain  against  40  mm  Hg  applied  for  15  seconds  by  blowing  into  a  mouthpiece
attached to a sphygmomanometer.
Following cessation of the Valsalva strain, the patient relaxes and breathes at a normal comfortable
rate.
The ECG is monitored during the strain and 30–45 seconds following its release.
The maximal heart rate of phase II actually occurs about 1 seconds following cessation of the strain.
The minimal heart rate occurs about 15–20 seconds after releasing the strain.

A  stroke  (cerebrovascular  accident  is  a  vague  term  which  should  be  avoided)  is  defined  as  a
syndrome of rapid (abrupt) onset of a neurologic deficit that is attributable to a focal vascular cause
(Flowchart 6E.2).
World Health Organization (WHO) definition: Stroke is a “rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or
global)  disturbance  of  cerebral  function,  with  symptoms  lasting  for  24  hours  or  longer  or  leading  to
death, with no apparent cause other than of vascular origin”.
Progressing  stroke  (or  stroke  in  evolution):  It  is  a  stroke  in  which  the  focal  neurological  deficit
worsens  after  the  patient  first  presents.  It  may  be  due  to  increasing  volume  of  infarction,  secondary
hemorrhage in the infarcted area, or increasing cerebral edema.
Complete  stroke:  Rapid  onset  with  persistent  focal  neurological  deficit  which  does  not  progress
beyond 96 hours.
Evolving stroke: Gradual stepwise development of neurological deficits. Focal cerebral deficits that
develop slowly (over weeks to months) are unlikely to be due to stroke and are more suggestive of
tumor or inflammatory or degenerative disease.

Terminologies

Several terms are used to classify strokes mainly based on the duration and evolution of symptoms.
•
•

Transient ischemic attack (TIA): Described later
Reversible  ischemic  neurological  deficit  (RIND):  In  some  cases,  deficits  last  for  longer  than  24
hours but resolve completely or almost completely within a few days.
Stuttering  hemiplegia:  Internal  carotid  lesions  are  characterized  by  repeated  episodes  of  TIA
followed by fully evolved stroke.

Transient Ischemic Attacks

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is characterized by a brief episode of neurological dysfunction (sudden
loss  of  function)  in  which  symptoms  and  signs  resolve  completely  after  a  brief  period  within  24  hours
(usually within 30 minutes).
•

Transient ischemic attack is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal
brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. However, TIAs may herald a stroke.
Newly proposed definition classifies those with new brain infarction as ischemic strokes regardless of
whether symptoms persist.

•

Clinical features: Hemiparesis and aphasia are most common. Other features include amaurosis fugax
(sudden transient loss of vision in one eye), hemisensory loss, hemianopic visual loss, diplopia, vertigo,
vomiting, choking and dysarthria, ataxia, etc.

Types of Transient Ischemic Attack
•

Large  artery  low-flow  TIA—recurrent,  short  lasting  episodes  of  stereotyped  symptoms  (shotgun
TIA/thrombotic TIA)
Embolic TIA—longer lasting less frequent episodes with varied symptoms, changing territories
Lacunar TIA.

•
•

Small Vessel (Lacunar) Stroke

•

•

Small  penetrating  arterial  branches  of  200–800  μm  in  diameter,  supply  the  deep  brain  parenchyma.
Each of these small branches can be occluded either by atherothrombotic disease at its origin or by
the development of occlusive vasculopathy—lipohyalinotic thickening (consequence of hypertension)
(Table 6E.5).
Thrombosis  of  these  vessels  causes  small  infarcts  that  are  referred  to  as  lacunae.  These  infarcts
range in size from 0.2 mm to 15 mm in diameter.

2. APPROACH TO SPINAL CORD DISEASES

Spinal Cord Anatomy

The spinal cord originates at the medulla and continues caudally to terminate at the filum terminale, a
fibrous extension of the conus medullaris is that terminates at the coccyx.

The  adult  spinal  cord  is  approximately  45  cm  long,  oval  or  round  in  shape,  and  enlarged  in  the
cervical  and  lumbar  regions,  where  neurons  that  innervative  the  upper  and  lower  extremities,
respectively  are  located.  The  meninges  that  cover  the  spinal  cord  are  continuous  with  those  of  the
brainstem and cerebral hemispheres.

Fig. 6E.4: Tracts of spinal cord.

•

•

The  adult  cord  consists  of  31  segments,  each  containing  an  exiting  ventral  motor  root  and  entering
dorsal sensory root.
During embryologic development, growth of the cord lags behind that of the vertebral column, and in
the  adult  spinal  cord  ends  at  approximately  the  first  lumbar  vertebral  body.  The  lower  spinal  nerves
take an increasingly downward course to exit via the appropriate intervertebral foramina.

•

•

The  first  seven  pairs  of  cervical  spinal  nerves  exit  above  the  same-numbered  vertebral  bodies,
whereas all the subsequent nerves exit below the same-numbered vertebral bodies; this situation is
due to the presence of eight cervical spinal cord segments but only seven cervical vertebrae.
The approximate relationship between spinal cord segments and the corresponding vertebral bodies
is shown in the following table:

SPECIFIC LOCALIZING SIGNS AT VARIOUS LEVELS

Features of Cervical Signs at Cord Lesion

In general, cervical cord disorders are best localized by the pattern of weakness that ensues, whereas
sensory deficits have less localizing value.
•

High cervical cord lesions (lesions above C5) are frequently life threatening, produce quadriplegia and
weakness of diaphragm, the main respiratory muscle innervated by the phrenic nerve (C3-C5).
Extensive  lesions  near  the  junction  of  the  cervical  cord  and  medulla  are  usually  fatal  owing  to
involvement of adjacent medullary centers, which results in vasomotor and respiratory collapse.
Compressive  lesions  near  the  foramen  magnum  may  produce  weakness  of  the  ipsilateral  shoulder
and  arm  followed  by  weakness  of  the  ipsilateral  leg,  then  the  contralateral  leg,  and  finally  the
contralateral arm (cartwheel pattern or Ellsberg phenomenon).
Lesions at C4-C5 produce quadriplegia with preserved respiratory function.
At the midcervical (C5-C6) level, there is relative sparing of shoulder muscles and loss of biceps and
brachioradialis reflexes.
Lesions at C7 spare the biceps but produce weakness of finger and wrist extensors and loss of the
triceps reflex.
Lesions at C8 paralyze finger and wrist flexion, and the finger flexor reflex is lost.
Horner’s  syndrome  (miosis,  ptosis,  and  facial  hypohidrosis)  may  also  occur  ipsilateral  to  cervical
lesions at any level.

•

•

•
•

•

•
•

Features of Thoracic Cord Lesion

Lesions of the thoracic cord are best localized by identification of a sensory level on the trunk.
•

Useful markers in terms of sensory dermatomes are at the nipples (T4), xiphisternum (T6), subcostal
margins (T8), umbilicus (T10), and pubic symphysis (T12)
The  abdominal  wall  musculature,  supplied  by  the  lower  thoracic  nerves  is  observed  during
movements of respiration or coughing or by asking the patient to interlock the fingers behind the head
in the supine position and attempt to sit up.
Lesions  at  T9-T10  paralyze  the  lower,  but  spare  the  upper,  abdominal  muscles,  resulting  in  upward
movement of the umbilicus when the abdominal wall contracts (Beevor’s sign) and in loss of lower, but
not upper, superficial abdominal reflexes.
With unilateral lesions, attempts to contract the abdominal wall produce movement of the umbilicus to
the normal side; superficial abdominal reflexes are absent on the involved side.
Midline back pain is a useful localizing sign in the thoracic region.

•

•

•

•

Feature of Lumbar Cord

Effect of various root lesions in lumbar region:

Roots

Motor deficit (most rapidly demonstrated)

L2

L3

L4

L5

S1

Hip flexion and thigh adduction

Knee extension and thigh adduction

Inversion of foot

Dorsiflexion to toes and foot

Plantar flexion and eversion of foot

•

•

•

Lesions at L2-L4 paralyze flexion and abduction of the thigh, weaken leg extension at the knee, and
abolish the patellar reflex.
Lesions at L5-S1 paralyze movements of the foot and ankle, flexion at the knee, and extension of the
thigh, and abolish the ankle jerk (S1).
A  cutaneous  reflex  useful  in  localization  of  lumbar  cord  disease  is  the  cremasteric  reflex,  which  is
segmentally innervated at L1-L2.

Features of Sacral Cord/Conus Medullaris

The conus medullaris is the tapered caudal termination of the spinal cord, comprising the lower sacral
and  single  coccygeal  segments.  Isolated  lesions  of  the  conus  medullaris  spare  motor  and  reflex
functions in the legs.

The Conus Syndrome (Fig. 6E.10)
•

Bilateral saddle anesthesia (S3-S5), prominent bladder and bowel dysfunction (urinary retention and
incontinence with lax anal tone), and impotence
The bulbocavernous (S2-S4) and anal (S4-S5) reflexes are absent
Muscle strength is largely preserved.

•
•

Cauda Equina Syndrome—Asymmetric, Atrophic, and Areflexic Paralysis of Lower Limbs (Fig.
6E.10)
•

The cluster of nerves derived from the lower cord as they descend to their exits in the intervertebral
foramina (L2-3 to coccygeal nerve roots).
Cauda  equina  lesions  are  characterized  by  severe  low  back  or  radicular  pain,  asymmetric  leg
weakness  or  sensory  loss,  variable  areflexia  in  the  lower  extremities,  and  relative  sparing  of  bowel
and bladder function.
Mass lesions in the lower spinal canal may produce mixed clinical picture in which elements of both
cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes coexist.

evacuation of the bladder is present, and rectum is preserved. Sexual potency is lost.

What are the Different Types of Spinal Pain?
•

Radicular  pain  is  characterized  as  a  unilateral,  lancinating,  dermatomal  pain  often  exacerbated  by
cough, sneeze, or Valsalva’s maneuver. Radicular pain is common with extradural growths and rare
with  intramedullary  lesions.  An  example  of  an  extramedullary  tumor  causing  radicular  pain  is  the
neurilemmoma (usually an intradural extramedullary lesion).
Vertebral  pain  is  characterized  by  an  aching  pain  localized  to  the  point  of  the  spine  involved  in  the
compressive  process  and  often  accompanied  by  point  tenderness.  Spinal  pain  is  common  with
neoplastic  or  inflammatory  extradural  lesions  and  infrequent  with  intramedullary  or  intradural
extramedullary lesions.
Funicular  (central)  pain  is  common  with  intramedullary  lesions  and  very  unusual  with  extradural
lesions.  It  is  described  as  deep,  ill-defined  painful  dysesthesias,  usually  distant  from  the  affected
spinal  cord  level  (and  therefore  of  poor  localizing  value),  probably  related  to  dysfunction  of  the
spinothalamic tract or posterior columns.

•

•

 
•

With  dysfunction  of  the  posterior  columns  in  the  cervical  region,  neck  flexion  may  elicit  a  sudden
“electric-like” sensation down the back or into the arms (Lhermitte’s sign or “barber’s chair syndrome).

always distal

Stocking-glove sensory motor loss results in symmetrical distal clinical signs in
legs and arms

Generalized weakness and mild sensory loss

Distal involvement

Proximal and distal involvement

Ankle jerk lost early and proximal tendon reflexes preserved

All reflexes are lost early

Muscle wasting common

Relatively absent

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins normal

Slow recovery

Residual deformity common

CSF proteins elevated (since nerve roots are
involved)

Rapid recovery

Residual deformity less common

Nerve conduction normal or slightly lowered

Nerve conduction is slowed

APPROACH TO A PATIENT WITH PARKINSON’S DISEASE

Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease (Paralysis Agitans)

It  is  a  chronic,  progressive  disorder  in  which  idiopathic  parkinsonism  occurs  without  evidence  of  more
widespread neurologic involvement.

Clinical Manifestations

Motor symptoms: Always asymmetrical in onset and become bilateral within a year (Table 6E.8).
•

Tremor is an early and presenting symptom in 70% of patients.

–

–
–

–

Frequency is 4–6 Hz tremor and is typically most prominent at rest and worsens with emotional
stress.
Typically tremor starts with the fingers and hands at rest.
Often  described  as  pill  rolling  of  finger  and  wrist,  because  the  patient  appears  to  be  rolling
something between thumb and forefinger.
Disappears on voluntary movement and sleep.

•

Rigidity:

–

Stiffness on passive limb movement is described as “lead pipe” rigidity because the increase in
muscle tone is present throughout the range of movement. Unlike spasticity, it is not dependent
on speed of movement.
When  tremor  is  superimposed  on  the  rigidity,  a  ratchet  like  jerkiness  is  felt,  described  as
“cogwheel” rigidity.
Akinesia or bradykinesia

–

•

–

Poverty/slowing of movement is the hallmark of parkinson’s disease (PD). Slowness/difficulty of
initiating  voluntary  movement  and  an  associated  reduction  in  automatic  movements,  such  as
swinging of the arms when walking.

–

–

There  is  fixity  of  facial  expression  (facial  immobility—mask  like  face)  with  widened  palpebral
fissures and infrequent blinking.
Repetitive  tapping  (at  about  2  Hz)  over  the  glabella  (glabellar  tap)  produces  a  sustained  blink
response (Myerson’s sign), in contrast to the response of normal subject.

•
•

•

Postural changes: A stooped posture is a characteristic feature.
Gait  changes:  Slow  shuffling,  freezing  and  reduced  arm  swing,  small  stride  length,  slow  turns,
festinating gait (tendency to advance rapid short steps) and catching center of gravity. Feet may be
glued to floor. Postural instability and freezing may result in fall forward.
Reduced eye blink.

Features

Slow ocular saccades, eyelid apraxia, and restricted eye movements with particular impairment of
downward gaze and reptilian stare [Fig. 6D(iii).37]. Frequently experience hyperextension of the neck
with early gait disturbance and falls. MRI may reveal a characteristic atrophy of the midbrain with relative
preservation of the pons (the ‘hummingbird sign’ on midsagittal images)

Parkinsonism in conjunction with cerebellar signs and/or early and prominent autonomic dysfunction,
usually orthostatic hypotension.
